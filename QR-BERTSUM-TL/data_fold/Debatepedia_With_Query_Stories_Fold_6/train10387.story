<s> voters : can voter and elections do a good jobs at elect judges ? <eos>

<s> voter are overwhelmed with so much information and so many candidates they usually know little to nothing about candidates for judges . this meaning that the resulting choice has little to do with the merits of the candidate . instead it is simply a crapshoot shot in the dark from voter that just do n't know enough to making a good choice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> voters do n't have enough information to pick the most judges <eos>
