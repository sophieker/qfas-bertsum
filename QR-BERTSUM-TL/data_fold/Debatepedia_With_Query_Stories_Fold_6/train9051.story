<s> while holocaust denial may be dangerous if it gained private support the government 's responsibility should be in fighting this with logic and reasoning oppose to a ban . rather it means that the state has a responsibility to ensure that the private are exposed to the argument that show that holocaust deniers are wrong . this is best doing through compulsory history teaching about the holocaust in schools . <eos>
