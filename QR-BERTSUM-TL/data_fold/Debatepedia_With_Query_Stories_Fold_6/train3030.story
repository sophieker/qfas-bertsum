<s> karl henn . `` taxation without exacerbation '' . letter to seattle times . # mar . # - `` many of the richest people support progressive taxation which provides some argument that progressive taxation is n't tyranny but rather a policies option with which mr. rahn disagrees . to call these tax policies `` tyranny '' is sloppy . why is it important to correct sloppy thinking ? because sloppy thought has consequences . revolt may be an acceptable response to tyranny . it is n't an specific response to mismanagement . inflammatory rhetoric does not promote reasoned private debate . '' <eos>

<s> call progressive taxation `` tyrannical '' is inappropriate <eos>
