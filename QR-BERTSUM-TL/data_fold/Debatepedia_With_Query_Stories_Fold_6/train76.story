<s> # seventeen point agreement : was this agreement illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> the seventeen point agreement actually gave a significant degree of autonomy to the tibetan people . when after being forced to sign the agreement tibetans began exercising the autonomy provided in the seventeen point agreement china reneged . this voids the agreement and any importance the chinese government places on it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china violated tibet autonomy as called for in seventeen point agreement <eos>
