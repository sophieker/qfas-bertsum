<s> social : are progressives taxes culturally valuable ? <eos>

<s> `` are progressive taxes a good thing ? '' critical mastiff . # aug. # - `` in our present fiscal situation wealthy people and corporations pay high federal incomes taxes and poorer people pay no incomes taxes at all or very few . therefore it makes sense for our rational actor the federal government to make law that give preference to the rich and corporations over the poor since taxes revenues respond much more quickly when the rich get richer than when the poor get less poor . such additional revenues can naturally be used to succor the same poor that the government has just harmed making the poor indebted to the government and to the particular elected officials of each district .
