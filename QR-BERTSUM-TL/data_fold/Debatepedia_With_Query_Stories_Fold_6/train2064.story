<s> religion : what are the religious pros and pros in this debate ? <eos>

<s> while it is true that there is a separation between church and state and that religion can not play a direct role in the law on incest this does not mean that it can not be weighed for its significance in creating the moral foundations of contemporary society . indeed the moral beliefs of a public are pertinent in considering what should be morally bearable and morally intolerable under the law . therefore to the extent that the bible ( and other faiths ) plays a role in contemporary moral think the bible 's condemnation of incest should favor a ban . <eos>

@highlight

<s> religion 's impact on morality must be considered in incest ban . <eos>
