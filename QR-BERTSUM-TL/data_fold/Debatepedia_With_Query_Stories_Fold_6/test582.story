<s> woman vs. black man : is the first female president more important than a black president ? <eos>

<s> racial tensions and problems abound in the united states while gender issues are much less of a problem today . obama is committed to helping solve these racial problems as was displayed by his march 18 2008 speech in philadelphia . and he is in a great position to do so as the son of a mixed couple . his race therefore puts him in a better position to solve a much bigger outstanding social problem in america as compared to hilary helping solve any remaining gender issues ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is more important to elect the first black candidate than the first female candidate . <eos>
