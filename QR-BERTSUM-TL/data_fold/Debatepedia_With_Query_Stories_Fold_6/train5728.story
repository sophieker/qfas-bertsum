<s> internationalized : could an aviation tax be internationalized ? <eos>

<s> climate change is a global problem and the icao was tasked in the kyoto protocol to look at how the aviation industry worldwide could reduce emissions . as it is in the interests of all countries to tackle aircraft emissions an international consensus could certainly be achieved given effort . agreements on other difficult issues have been reached in the past ( e.g . the millennium development goals anti-landmine treaties the montreal climate change conference in # ) . even before international agreement is reached groups of states could still adopt such a tax effectively . for example eu states could apply a fuel tax to eu airlines on european flights and extend it to non-eu airlines in europe by renegotiating air service agreements with other states . <eos>

<s> a tax on aviation fuel could certainly be put into effect on an international basis . <eos>
