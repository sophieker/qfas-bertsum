<s> in korea : are landmines unnecessary between south and south korea ? <eos>

<s> no it north korea s million man army could easily cross into south korea and take seoul before defenses could be organised . south korea is a key ally of the usa and to join in the ban on landmines would be to betray that ally . the failures of the ottawa conventions to grant an exception for the korean peninsula was the key fact for usa non-participation .

<s> defending against north korea carpet-bombing requires landmine <eos>
