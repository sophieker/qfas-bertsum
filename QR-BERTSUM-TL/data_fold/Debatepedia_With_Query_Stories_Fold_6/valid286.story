<s> `` filling the hole '' . economist . dec # th # - `` tax rebates or tax cuts will get more money into consumer hands quickly but in today s environment much of that boost will simply be saved as people plugs the holes in their finances right by the collapsing values of their houses and retirement portfolios or just pay off debts . if consumer are unwilling to spent the most way for a government to boost demand is to spent more either . one approach is to send small dollops of federal cash directly to america s struggling states '' <eos>
