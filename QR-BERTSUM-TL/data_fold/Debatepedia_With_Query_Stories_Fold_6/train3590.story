<s> states : if states have it should the fed govt ? <eos>

<s> the fact that some states have balanced budget amendments often means that during hard times when tax revenues are low states have to dramatically cut spending . this can damage or even fully close many programs that deserve to exist and are sustainable during good or even just average times . if they were able to run a short or medium term deficit during bad times they would n't have to do this . so it is very arguable whether states should have balanced budget amendments . this undermines the argument `` if states can do it so can the federal govt . '' just because some states have done it does n't mean it 's a good idea for them nor a good idea for the us government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> balanced budget amend in states is often a bad thing . <eos>
