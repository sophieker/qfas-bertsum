<s> is light pollutants a problem ? <eos>

<s> in some significant cities like newest york and sometimes paris and london the stars are not visible at all because of light pollution . even in smaller cities light pollution blocks the view of the sky . the night sky would be far more interesting and has proven to be better without light pollution . initiatives like earth hour helping light pollution to ease and makes the view of the sky much more visible . it is not a life or death situation but this still is a problem and astronomers would loved the problem to be fixed . even lisa simpson ( from the simpsons ) has a strong hate of light pollution and springfield temporarily fixes the problem in another episode . <eos>

<s> stars could be much more visible and fascinating if light pollution did n't exist . <eos>
