<s> infrastructure : is a naturally gas vehicles infrastructure feasible ? <eos>

<s> naturally fuel pumps are rare . in the united states for instance only # % of all fuel stations have naturally fuel pumps . this relates to the fact that the naturally fuel industry is young and naturally fuel pipelines do not extending to all places where naturally fuel stations are needed . this badly limits the growth of naturally fuel vehicles as those will not purchase the vehicles unless they know that a robust refills infrastructures exists to support them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> naturally gas stations are temporarily in some places <eos>
