<s> enforcement : is it impossible to effectively regulate file-sharing and any law against it ? <eos>

<s> while it be be impossible to detect each single downloads from the internet that does not mean that we should stop . for example lawsuits can be brought against both companies and individuals engaged in illegal filesharing . the argument that because we can t do it perfectly we shouldn t try at all is ridiculous as we could then stop trying to catch pirates that burning cds or tape videos and then selling them on a large scale .

@highlight

<s> difficulties of law do not think we should abandon copyright laws . <eos>
