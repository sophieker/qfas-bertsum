<s> families : is investment punishment good for the family of victims ? <eos>

<s> jeff conley - `` it is up to the law to speak to them-to speak for all grief-stricken victims confronted with the butchery of someone nearby and dear . capital punishment says to them : we the community take your loss with the utmost seriousness . we know that you are filled with rage and pain . we know that you may cry for vengeance may yearn to strangle the murderer with your naked hands . you are way to feeling that way . but it is not for you to wreak retribution . as a decent and just society we will do it . fairly . after due process . in a court of law .
