<s> enforcement : can a nuclear test ban treaty be effectively enforced ? <eos>

<s> under a test ban treat any sort of testing whether civil or military in nature will be - officially - intolerable . but how is the world to respond to such an `` intolerable '' threat ? through military action sanctions or by other means ? it may be forced to respond militarily simply to protect its legitimacy in upholding the ban yet with great consequences as a result . or more likely aggressive action will not be taken and the legitimacy of the united nations will be further undermined . either outcome would be an unfortunate result of the ctbt . <eos>

@highlight

<s> enforcing a nuclear test ban is a risky proposition . <eos>
