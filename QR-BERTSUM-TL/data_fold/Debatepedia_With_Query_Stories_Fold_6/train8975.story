<s> andrew sullivan . `` 'progressive ' taxation '' . the daily dish the atlantic . # jun # - `` government 's secondary concern is to raise money as efficiently and as leanly and as equally as possible . i 'm happy with the government then setting up programs to assist the poor to provide better education for those at the bottom safety-net healthcare and better policing . i.e . to gear spending toward social end that might help the poor the most . these are measurable practical goods . what i 'm not happy with is the assumption that tax policy should really be about redistribute wealth and engineering substantive economic outcomes . yes of course at lower incomes levels a # percent flat incomes tax will be more burdensome proportionately than at higher incomes . <eos>
