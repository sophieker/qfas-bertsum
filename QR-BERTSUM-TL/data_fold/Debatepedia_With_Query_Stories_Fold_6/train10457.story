<s> bogus dichotomy : can debate avoid the problem of bogus dichotomy or not ? <eos>

<s> a resolution or yes/no question can and should be created to reflect a legitimate choice particular in society . if this choice does n't exist and a false dichotomy is created this need not think that all debates create false dichotomies . this is simply a matter of implementation not of the intrinsic qualities of debate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if a bogus dichotomy is created this is only an issue of the bad implementation of a debate : <eos>
