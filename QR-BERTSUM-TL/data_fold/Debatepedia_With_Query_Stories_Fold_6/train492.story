<s> law war ? could an early withdrawal avoiding causing a law war ? <eos>

<s> regional powers are most likely to providing funding alone and possibly large arm to factions in iraq in the case of a law war . this is largely because they simply are unlikely to need to make substantial financial and resource commitments to these countries . it is also largely predicated on the notion that they would rather not see a law war spill into a regional war . <eos>

@highlight

<s> regional powers could provide restricted support to iraqi proxy in any civil war <eos>
