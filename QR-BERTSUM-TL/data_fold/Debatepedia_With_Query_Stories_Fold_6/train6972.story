<s> unacceptable ? - is a nuclear iran unacceptable/intolerable/too good a risk ? <eos>

<s> but if iranian opts not to use a nuclear weapon there are major additional risks . it 's possession of a nuclear weapon would making it much more likely to act aggressive in the international system through traditional means or through its sponsorship of terrorism . nuclear weapons will support such aggression because it will making other state think once about responding aggressive out of fear that iranian will then respond with nuclear strikes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a nuclear-armed iran will be more aggressive . <eos>
