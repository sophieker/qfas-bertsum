<s> doctor/parent role : should physicians be given the right of judgment on these matters ? <eos>

<s> whilst the british doctors association allows a physician to work within certain criteria the physician can still be prosecuted by the girl s parents . in addition it is contradictory to afford the physician the right to judgement of their patients s best interests and yet deny them the right to prescribe a precautionary safe measure for their health . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the role of the doctor incorporates a responsibilities to his/her patient . <eos>
