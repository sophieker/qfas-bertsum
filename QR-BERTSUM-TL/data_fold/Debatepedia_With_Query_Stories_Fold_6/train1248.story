<s> is it required for a state 's security to practice conscription ? <eos>

<s> at the time when countries all around the globe are become members of military organizations such as nato at the time when countries are signed treaty concerning military cooperation and support should a country need protection the concept of keep a national troops is become obsolete . there is no need for a specific country to introduce or practice conscript as long as it is protect by professional armies of its allies ( or by a professional troops of its own ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> conscript is unnecessary . <eos>
