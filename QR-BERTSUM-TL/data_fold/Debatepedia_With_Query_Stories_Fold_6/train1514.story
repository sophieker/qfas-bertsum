<s> 2nd bomb : was it necessary to drop the second bomb on nagasaki ? <eos>

<s> the americans wanted to end the war quickly - they could not even wait for two months . if they waited the casualties would not be so much . the us killed 215 000 in the bombings . the most they can kill in two months without using the atomic bombs would definitely not exceed 200 000 ! - this shows they were not only impatient but biased . just because the japanese military caused lots of trouble they exceeded their mercilessness to the civillians . humanitarians like mamoru shinozaki could have been killed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us was mercilessly impatient in dropping bombs so quickly . <eos>
