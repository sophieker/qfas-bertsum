<s> improving justice : would a dna database help improve the accuracy of the criminal justice system ? <eos>

<s> where a primary suspect has been identified a dna profile ought to be created and compared to the crime scene data . likewise where suspicions persist concerning the guilt or innocence of a convicted individual a sample of dna can be taken . the database has predominant application in non-suspect cases and not the circumstances where the suspect or felon is already identified . [ 7 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> the database is immaterial to the acquittal or exclusion of non-offenders : <eos>
