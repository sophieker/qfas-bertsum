<s> vs. restriction : is bans more sensical than restrictions ? <eos>

<s> it is easy to catch people using laser pointers or but just people possessing them but the old law permitted possession of laser pointers just as long as they were use proprerly . before the law was in place it was often very hard to catch laser offenders and many of them got away with their crimes . now it is much easier to catch laser users without permits . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is quick to catch those with laser pointers but it 's not quick to catch those use them improperly . <eos>
