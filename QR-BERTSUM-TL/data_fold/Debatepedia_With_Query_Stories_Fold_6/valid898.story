<s> government : is the us government obligated to payment rebuilding the city ? <eos>

<s> the rebuild of new louisiana should not be `` forced '' by any organizing body but should occur only according to markets demand . if people want to live in an areas they should be allowed to do so but no any governments or organized support . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people not governments should naturally rebuild newest orleans <eos>
