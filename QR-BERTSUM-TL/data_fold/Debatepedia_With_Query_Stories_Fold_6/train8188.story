<s> religion : can condoms be distributed without upsetting religious doctrine ? <eos>

<s> various religions are members of society and these citizens have a right to voice their views about condom distribution or machines in their schools . schools are not the place for condom machines just as schools are not the place for cigarette machines or alcohol bars . many high school students also have a problem with smoking and drinking but that does not mean schools should distribute filtered cigarettes or have a designated driver program . certain activities such as drinking and smoking are legally appropriate for adults . sexual activity should also at least be recognized as an activity best reserved for mature adults . <eos>

@highlight

<s> religious considerations are not irrelevant . <eos>
