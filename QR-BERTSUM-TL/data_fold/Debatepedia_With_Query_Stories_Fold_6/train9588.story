<s> economics : what are the sociology of carbon capturing and sequestration ? <eos>

<s> robert bryce . `` a bad bet on carbon . '' new york times . be # # : `` here s the second problem . the pacific northwest national lab has estimated that up to # # miles of new pipeline will be needed to carry the capture carbon dioxide to the r-ok underground sequestration sites . that doesn t sounds like too when you consider that america s gas pipeline system sprawls over some # . # million miles . but those natural gas pipelines carry a valuable marketable useful commodity . by contrast carbon dioxide is a worthless waste product so taxpayers would likely end up shouldering most of the cost . yeah some of that waste gas could be used for enhanced oil recovery projects ; flooding depleted oil reservoirs <eos>

@highlight

<s> the transportation of captured dioxide can be very expensive <eos>
