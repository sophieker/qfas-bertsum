<s> equality : does progressives taxation uphold principles of equality ? <eos>

<s> progressive tax systems erroneously aim to combat inequality in people 's circumstance aiming to produce greater equality of outcome . the main problem with this is that it does not apply a strict principle ( such as equality under the law ) but rather engage government in the subjective and impossible act of balancing individual rights with an effort to produce equal outcome . <eos>
