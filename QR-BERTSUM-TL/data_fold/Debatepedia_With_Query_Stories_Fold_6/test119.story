<s> `` education poverty and terrorism : is there a causal connection ? '' journal of economic perspectives . fall # : `` our reviews of the evidence provides little reason for optimism that a reduction in poverty or an increase in educational attainment would meaningfully reduce international terrorism . any connection between poverty education and terrorism is indirect difficult and probably quite weak . rather of viewing terrorism as a direct response to low market opportunities or ignorance we suggest it is more accurately viewed as a response to political conditions and longstanding feelings of ignominy and frustrations that have little to do with economics .
