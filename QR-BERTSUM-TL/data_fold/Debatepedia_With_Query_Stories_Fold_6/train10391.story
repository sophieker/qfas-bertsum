<s> democracy : will a republic make australia more democratic ? is this important ? <eos>

<s> with an elected head of state a very large percentage of a national population find themselves being led by a person they did not vote for . the governor-general conversely is appointed by the monarch and so is able to stand above an election process that would divide his or her constituents . the governor-general therefore can represent all australians which is democratically appealing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the governor-general represents all australians ; not just his/her voters <eos>
