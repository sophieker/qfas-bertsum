<s> stereotypes vs. reality : does gangster hip-hop promoting false stereotypes ? <eos>

<s> mostly it is a form of society realistic which simply tells hard truths that many policymakers would rather pretending did not exist not least because in part they reflects those policymakers own failures . but where such affirming is concentrated in such a way as to make it an unrealistic representations of everyday lives this is no worse than the same phenomenon in other forms of popular culture e.g . soap operas . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gangsters rapper merely tell it how it is . <eos>
