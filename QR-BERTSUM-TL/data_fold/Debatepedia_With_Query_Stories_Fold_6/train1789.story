<s> value of debate : does allowing debate legitimize genocide denial ? <eos>

<s> this is not the case : there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the holocaust did not happen . if reputable historians debate with holocaust deniers it implies that the claims of holocaust deniers have sufficient merits to be regarded on the same level as interpretations basis upon a reasonable reading of historical evidence . thus saying as those do `` all ideas should be open for consideration and debate including holocaust denial '' is an unjustifiable position ; it give undue credit and consideration to a mccorvey discredited and socially threatening viewpoint . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debating genocide implies there are two reasonable viewpoints . <eos>
