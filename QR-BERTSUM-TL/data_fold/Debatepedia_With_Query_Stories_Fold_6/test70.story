<s> sovereignty : should states have sovereign control over their water resources ? <eos>

<s> if water resources within the boundary of a nation state are considered part of the globally wikimedia this would have harmful ramifications for sovereignty over natural resources in general . a `` slippery slope '' would be created in which the sovereign right of states to controls their natural resources would be violated in many more ways than with water resources alone . forests mining and minerals could all become subject to international controls at a cost to national sovereignty . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a globally commons of water could endanger many elements of national sovereignty . <eos>
