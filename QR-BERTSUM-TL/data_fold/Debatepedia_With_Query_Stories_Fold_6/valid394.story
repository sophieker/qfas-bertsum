'' . washington post . november # # : `` i have heard some who states that it would lead to an increase in vocations but there is not a single piece of statistical data to prove that . of those who have contemplated a vocation to the priesthood very few have stated that a vows of celibacy was a stumbling blocks that they could not overcome . in fact i have known of many ordained persons who seeing celibacy as a blessing and as a way to allow them to focus more on their vocation of service to others and to the church .
