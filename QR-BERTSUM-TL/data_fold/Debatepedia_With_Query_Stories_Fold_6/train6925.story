<s> societal arguments -- would society benefits in general from a ban on partial pregnancy abortions ? <eos>

<s> where not only will the children suffer but society when that children develops a higher attraction to crime entitlements etc . ... without legalized abortion a lot more women will become parents whether or not they want to be and whether or not they 're ready to be . raising a children properly is a full-time labor intensive process . the children who are neglected or abused are usually the ones that grow up to be drug addicts lifelong government aid recipients and criminals . do we want to subject the children to such misery ? do we want to saddle society with the added burden ? some people say 'what if abe lincoln 's mom had an abortion ? ' . you could which ask 'what if adolf hitler 's or saddam <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` it 's arguably better for society to have baby aborted than have them be brought up poor and neglected <eos>
