<s> taxes : does principle of no tax no representation apply ? <eos>

<s> prisoners are not treated as poltically dead when it benefits the state : they are liable for taxation on any earnings and savings that they have . there should be no taxation no representation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the state is disingenuous in taxation prisoners but not giving them a vote . <eos>
