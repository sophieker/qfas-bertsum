<s> meat production is highly inefficient in land-use . this often means that forests are illustrative in order to creating room for the grazing of cattle . this eliminates important carbon-sinks that are necessary in reducing atmospheric co # levels and fighting global warming . clearcut can also increase the reflectivity of the earth 's surface which contributes to warming . meat production also generally consumes much more energy than other forms of farming . since much of this energy involves carbon-based fuels meat production contributes significant carbon into the atmosphere . finally the methane fuel from the bowl-functions of cattle contribute to the global warming problem . <eos>
