<s> the consumer : does the consumer benefit ? are price lowered by outsourcing ? <eos>

<s> by shifting production to low-wage economies companies are able to profit from paying substandard wages and often offering appalling working conditions . the fact that there are so many poor undeveloped countries with substantial unemployment means that countries will race to the bottom in a desperate attempt to undercut each other and so make themselves more attractive for offshoring investment . in other words offshoring and outsource decreases costs for companies but does not necessarily benefit the consumers through quality service or higher prices . <eos>

@highlight

<s> offshoring is simply a way of unfairly exploiting cheap foreign labour . <eos>
