<s> survival : many of the arts would not survive without subsidies ? <eos>

<s> commercially-funded arts have to play to the lowest common denominator avoiding risk by providing what has proved popular and successful in the past ( for example musicals and endless productions of shakespeare s as you like it or tchaikovsky s nutcracker suite ) . subsidised companies can afford to take more risks and to experiment enabling new styles and forms of art to emerge and to become popular in their own right . <eos>

@highlight

<s> subsidies help foster newer more innovative forms of art . <eos>
