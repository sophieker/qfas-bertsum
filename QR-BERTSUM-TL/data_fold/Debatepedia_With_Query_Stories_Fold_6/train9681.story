<s> environment/land-use : does solar energy use a reasonable amount of land ? <eos>

<s> the sun light and its energy hit the earth 's surface in a diffuse manner . in other words not much sunlight hits a square meter on the earth 's surface . in order to gather significant quantities of this energy a large swath of territory must be covered by solar panels . this makes solar energy land-intensive which creates pressures to clear lands of trees for solar panels . this can eliminate important carbon sinks and have a negative impact on global warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> solar energy requires too much land damaging the environment <eos>
