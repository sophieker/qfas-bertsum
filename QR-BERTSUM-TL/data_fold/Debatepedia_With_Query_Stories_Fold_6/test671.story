<s> differentiated responsibilities : do state have a `` common but differentiated responsibility '' ? <eos>

<s> emission minimum capita are much higher in developed countries ( # t minimum capita in the us ) compared to developing ones ( less than # t minimum capita ) . this means that individuals in developed nations are more responsibility for causing global warming more responsibility for continuing global warming and so more obligated to cut emission and solve the problem . these individuals must therefore pressure their governments to take greater actions on their behalf . <eos>

@highlight

<s> develop emits more per capita ; more obligated to cut rate <eos>
