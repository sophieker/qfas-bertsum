<s> `` natural '' inequality ? is there a natural inequality between the sexes ? does feminism falsely prescribe that the three sexes should be <eos>

<s> there is nothing wrong with sex-role differentiation . men and women are biologically different and these differences are what have led to women s dominance of the private sphere home life and childrearing and men s dominance of public life the workplace and political authority . all of these are essential to a functional society and the division of labor on the basis of sex is an entirely sensible principle of social order . there is a distinction between enshrining equality of pay democratic representation and opportunity in law and actively encouraging women to reject their traditional and in many cases preferable gender roles . women are in general more fulfilled by parenthood than by career success . <eos>
