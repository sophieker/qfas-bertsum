<s> wealthy : is a progressives tax system reasonable to the wealthy ? <eos>

<s> judicial in representation . economic equity is sometimes used to argue against progressive taxation on the grounds of representations being out-of-proportion to taxation : while the top # % in income in most countries pay over half the taxes [ # ] they only have # % of the voting weight . this argument can be reversed into the plutocratic case that if tax is to be progressive it should be accompanying by greater say in election for those who contribute most . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the affluent paying more taxes but are n't given more voting power . <eos>
