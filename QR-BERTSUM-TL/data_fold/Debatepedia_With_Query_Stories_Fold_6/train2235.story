<s> religion : do faiths define marriage a certain way and does this matter ? <eos>

<s> andrew sullivan . `` why 'civil union ' is n't marriage . '' the new republic . may 8 2000 : `` equally an appeal to the religious content of marriage is irrelevant in this case . no one is proposing that faith communities be required to change their definitions of marriage unless such a community like reform jewry decides to do so of its own free will . the question at hand is civil marriage and only civil marriage . in a country where church and state are separate this is no small distinction . many churches for example forbid divorce . but civil divorce is still legal . many citizens adhere to no church at all . should they be required to adhere to a religious teaching in order to be legally married ?
