<s> morality : is child labor immoral ? would the ban ameliorate the moral issue ? <eos>

<s> `` it is also argued that child labour in poor countries imposes emotional costs on rich-country consumers who find this offensive and is thus another transnational side-effect . if so the richer would do better to sending the children aid rather than impose harmful trade sanctions . '' [ `` the standard question '' the economist january # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> ban on exports is harmful . <eos>
