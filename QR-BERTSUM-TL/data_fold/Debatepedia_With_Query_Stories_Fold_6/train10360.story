<s> advertisements : do television ads have a negative influence on individuals ? <eos>

<s> the influences of commercials reaches our society through newspaper radio and other sources of information . on the other hand advertisements is just a source of information for consumers which enables them to choose between different products . advertising can also be regulated in different ways that do not relate to a debate about television . indeed television broadcasting can be running without advertising at all ; the u.k. s bbc runs no commercials but is paid for through a licensing fee while commercial broadcasters are increasingly promoting pay-per-view options . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tv is not the only tools for advertisement : <eos>
