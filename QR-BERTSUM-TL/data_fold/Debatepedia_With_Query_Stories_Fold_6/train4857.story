<s> civil rights : is gay marriage a civil right ? <eos>

<s> everyone has the right to enter whatever consensual relationships they choose but no one has the right to have the government recognize and grant special benefits to them merely because of that relationship . thus the law can not recognize `` gay marriage '' `` straight marriage '' and `` bisexual marriage '' as distinct rights . if it did then there would be no equality amongst them because gays would not have `` straight marriage rights '' bisexuals would not have `` gay marriage rights '' etc . further being unmarried is just as much a right as being married yet the law should not create `` unmarried rights '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> free association <eos>
