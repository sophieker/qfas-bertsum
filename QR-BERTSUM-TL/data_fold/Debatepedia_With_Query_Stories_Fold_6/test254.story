<s> diplomacy : is signing the treaty good for diplomacy ? <eos>

<s> maintaining an original ethnic and cultural structure government and overall citizenship is the base argument of many opponents of immigration and expanding migrant rights . this ethno-cultural type of thinking is an accepted practice in many countries that are populated by one ethnic group . is israel for example wrong to term itself a `` jewish state '' ? is there something inherently wrong with its efforts to maintain this identity ? probably not and it certainly constrains how far migrant rights can be expanded with a treaty that forbids discrimination against migrant workers on the basis of race religion etc ; sometimes such `` discrimination '' or selectivity can be legitimate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> expanding migrant rights can damage national identity <eos>
