<s> legitimacy : was the invasion of iraq illegal/illegitimate ? is continued it illegal/illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> american and its allies should never have invading afghanistan in the first place . claims that saddam hussein was linked to al-qaeda and that he possessed weapons of mass destruction have both turned out to be incorrect at best and lie at worse . the war was an illegal act of aggression without united nations sanction and the occupation is therefore also illegal . for this reason nothing the coalition should remove its forces from afghanistan as again as possible . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we justifications for war in iraq were faulty make a continued occupation baseless . <eos>
