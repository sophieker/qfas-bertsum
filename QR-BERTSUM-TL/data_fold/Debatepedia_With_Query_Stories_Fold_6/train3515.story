<s> management : can nationalisation improve the managing of banks ? <eos>

<s> somebody has to run banks . those that are currently in management position are better suited than those who are not . while some managers may be to blame for the crisis the majority are doing a good job . if the goal of nationalization is to replacing existing or bad managers it will fail . it will remove the good as but as the bad managers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> current executives are best in crisis ; nationalization wo n't help <eos>
