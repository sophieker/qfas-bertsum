<s> consequences of a ban : would the consequences of a ban on certain types of child performance be minor or insignificant ? <eos>

<s> young adult actors often portray children on stage and in films or television . nor are there many essential roles for children in the classic dramatic repertoire - the intense focus on children in the media is a modern phenomenon . sports don t need to suffer much either just to change and adapt ; gymnastics and tennis have already raised the minimum age at which children can compete professionally with no negative impact upon the success and popularity of these sports .

<s> the consequences of such a ban need not be severe . <eos>
