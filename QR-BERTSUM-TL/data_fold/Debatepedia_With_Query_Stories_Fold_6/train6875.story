<s> false dichotomy : can debate avoid the problem of false dichotomy or not ? <eos>

<s> this is a situation where a choice is presented between two options when in reality there may be many other alternatives to choose from . such a false dichotomy may completely ignore a third forth or firth alternative . in this sense it may ignore the best solution making the purpose of the exercise seem tangential to finding a solution . dialogue enables for a more fluid and dynamic presentation of issues that better represent the reality of a complicated problem and a complicated solution . in this sense dialogue represents the full true complexity of an issue instead of over-simplifying it in a `` false dichotomy '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debate can lead to `` false dichotomies '' . <eos>
