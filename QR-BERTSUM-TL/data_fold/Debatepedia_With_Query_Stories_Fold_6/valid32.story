<s> would free public transport help the environment ? <eos>

<s> buses planes trains etc . all harms the environment just as cars do . if everyone used public transportation more buses would pollute cities . it should also be mentioned that the manufacturing and creation of a public transportation system is very electricity intensive drawing largely on coal and fossil fuels for energy . this releases significant carbon emission into the atmosphere . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we could want more private transport . <eos>
