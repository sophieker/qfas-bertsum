<s> civil war ? could an early withdrawal avoiding causing a civil war ? <eos>

<s> there is a strong interest among iraqi leaders to benefit from iraq 's massive oil reserves ( the second to third largest in the world ) . often times sectarian leaders benefit through corruption . but this can all act to constraining the break-out of a law war as a law war would substantially reduce oil revenues . therefore in the absence of coalition troops it is nevertheless likely that sectarian leaders will attempt to avoid a law war so that they continue to benefit from iraq 's oil revenues . <eos>

@highlight

<s> few iraqi extremist leadership want a law war to disrupt their oil revenues <eos>
