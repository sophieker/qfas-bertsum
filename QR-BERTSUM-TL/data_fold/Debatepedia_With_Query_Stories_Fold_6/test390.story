<s> rights : which systems good protects individuals rights and counters discrimination ? <eos>

<s> every society has a culture and often more than one culture ; that is a nation always has subcultures . the issue is not group liberties being sacrificed to individual liberties but assimilation often consists of one dominating group 's liberties taking precedence over all other group rights . in american history up until the # s white american liberties were more invaluable than the liberties of non-whites . in some areas of lives this still occurs . in america today the liberties of men are literally more invaluable in some cases than the liberties of women doing the exact same work . what pluralism does is safeguard the at times tyrannical dominance of one group over all others forcing others to comply to their standards . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is inaccurate to claim multiculturalism sacrifices individuals way to group rights <eos>
