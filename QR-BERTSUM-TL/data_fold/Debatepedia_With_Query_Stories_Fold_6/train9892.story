<s> due punishment : can punishments punishment be warranted and due to a criminal ? <eos>

<s> a throwback to societies built on military might slavery and the treatment of murderers as humans without any rights . the marks of civilized society is that it behaves better than its criminals . jail is necessary as a method of punishment prevention and rehabilitation but it does not ( or at least should not ) stoop to cruelty ; which is why the un declaration of humans rights prohibits `` torture or ... cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment '' .

@highlight

<s> punishing with pains is barbarian . <eos>
