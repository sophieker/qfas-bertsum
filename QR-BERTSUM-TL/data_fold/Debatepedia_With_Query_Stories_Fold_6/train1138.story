<s> the one most destructive issue regarding health care in america is the lack of preventative care . patients wait until their disease progresses to a dangerous level before they seek care because otherwise they can not afford doctors cost . universal health care offers them access thus increase the patient 's incentive to seek care when the health threat is minimal and in the long run reducing the burdens to the state . <eos>
