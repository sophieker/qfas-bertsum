<s> international law : was the bombing of japan consistent with international law ? <eos>

<s> in 1963 the bombings were the subject of a judicial review in ryuichi shimoda et al . v. the state . [ 43 ] on the 22nd anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor the district court of tokyo declined to rule on the legality of nuclear weapons in general but found that `` the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki caused such severe and indiscriminate suffering that they did violate the most basic legal principles governing the conduct of war . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the bombing of japan was illegal under the international law of the time . <eos>
