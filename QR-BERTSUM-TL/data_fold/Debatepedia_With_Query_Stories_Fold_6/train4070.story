<s> information : does facebook help spread `` undesirable '' information ? does it matter ? <eos>

<s> even though twitter - in theory - tries to prevent young children from having their own profile in practice are its controls ineffective as the only `` proof '' of someone 's age is his or her own confirmation . therefore even young children have accessing to certain inappropriate content ( groups fan page videos photos ) which can be morally damaging . <eos>

@highlight

<s> improper content is not limited by age . <eos>
