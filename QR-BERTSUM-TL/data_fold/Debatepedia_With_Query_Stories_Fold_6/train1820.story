'' the barr code . may 3rd 2010 : `` protecting our borders is in fact a singularly federal function ; reflecting the fundamental responsibility of the national government to protect our sovereignty . traditionally and appropriately states have not been permitted to assume federal government functions ; just as washington should not be permitted to assert powers properly left to the states . this split of enforcement authority while in modern times often not honored by the federal government is codified in the constitution including in the tenth amendment .
