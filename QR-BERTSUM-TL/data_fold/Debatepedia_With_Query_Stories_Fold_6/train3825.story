<s> religion : can condoms be distribution no upsetting religious doctrine ? <eos>

<s> . teenager sex predates both condom machines and high schools . teenagers are probably interested in sexual relations because there is the opposite gender in schools . it is possible to ban the opposite gender in schools but that is only part of the problem . the other contributing factor is teenager hormones . an interest in engaging in sexual relations does not undermine religious doctrines unless one knows to become a priest . religious doctrines does not forbid sexual relations but encourages the safe or responsible management of it and this usually includes discouraging pre-marital sex coveting someone else 's wife ( and probably husband as well ) and adultery . <eos>

@highlight

<s> put a condom machine in a schools does not mean that all student are encouraged to have sex <eos>
