<s> human rights : has china failed to improve its human rights and is a boycott the right response ? <eos>

<s> - the chinese people are very excited about the olympics in their country . to boycott the event would send a strongly negative and antagonizing signal to them . feelings of alienation would last for years that could have negative consequences in china 's relations with the world . and yet there is no reason to believe that china 's anger at a boycott could be translated into any positive impacts on the policies of the chinese government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a boycott of the 2008 olympics would antagonize the chinese people <eos>
