<s> vs. harm reduction : is a `` war '' a better idea than harm reduction ? <eos>

<s> many of the health dangers associated with recreational drugs exist or are made worse precisely because they are illegal . the government can not enforce quality control on products sold and manufactured illegally . examples include : the easier to make derivative mda being sold as mdma heroin users unintentionally injecting brick dust quinine or fentanyl with which their heroin had been cut ; and heroin/cocaine overdoses occurring as a result of users not knowing exactly how much they are taking . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legalizing drugs would improve quality control <eos>
