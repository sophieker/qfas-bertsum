<s> marriage defined : can definition of marriage include gay marriage ? <eos>

<s> marriage is a commitment to love and care for your spouse till death . this is what is heard in all wedding vows . civil marriage vows emphasize love and commitment . reproduction and child-rearing are not mentioned nor is the sexual orientation of individuals . and wedding vows being the essential element of a wedding ceremony should be seen as the most authoritative expression of what defines marriage . gays can clearly qualify for marriage according to these vows and any definition of marriage deduced from these vows . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marriage is about love/commitment ; gays qualify <eos>
