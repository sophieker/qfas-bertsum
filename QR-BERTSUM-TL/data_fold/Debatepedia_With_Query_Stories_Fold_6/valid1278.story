<s> waterboarding : is waterboarding a legitimately form of interrogation ? <eos>

<s> - the consensus definition of torture in such conventions as the un convention against torture the fourth geneva convention and the rome statute of the international crimes courts is that it inflicts `` severe pain and suffering '' for the purpose of extracting information or a confession . waterboarding inflicts `` severe pain and suffering '' by making its victim feel as though they are drowning and that their own death is inevitable . the terrorism of a near death experience can definitely be described as suffering and the pain of having your lungs filling with water and approaching near strangulation can be described as pain . thus water boarded inflicts `` severe pain and suffering '' and can be described as torture . <eos>
