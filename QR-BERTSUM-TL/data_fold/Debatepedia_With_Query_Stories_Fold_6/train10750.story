<s> deterrence : is nuclear deterrent meaningless today ? <eos>

<s> terrorists are frequently willing to kill themselves to commit act of terrorism . therefore the threat of retaliatory death and destruction against terrorists will not create a level of fear within them that will `` deter '' them from commit an initial terrorist act . <eos>

@highlight

<s> terrorists are not deterred by the threats of nuclear weapon <eos>
