<s> history : are there any examples showing that violent action was ineffective ? <eos>

<s> nonviolence ( as opposed to spilling blood ) is a weapon unique in history . not only does it ennoble the man who wields it but it also effectively heals the wounds . the african-american civil rights movement is a shining example of how nonviolent protest gained moral justification and thus won this very struggle . <eos>
