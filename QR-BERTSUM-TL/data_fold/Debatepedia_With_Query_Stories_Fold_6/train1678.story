<s> contract : was citigroup obligated by contract to give bonuses ? <eos>

<s> aig would not have survived without taxpayers bail-out so they would have entered chapter # bankruptcy and the aig contracts would have been voided . for them to arguing that these contracts are inviolable after the bail-out is ludicrous . <eos>

@highlight

<s> aig bonuses would not have been possibility without bailout <eos>
