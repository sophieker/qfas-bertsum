<s> social : do tv advertisements targeted children have positive social consequences ? <eos>

<s> . much of it is for food and drinks that are very unhealthy . encouraging gullible children to consume so much fats sugary and salty food is unethical because it creates overweight unhealthy youngsters with bad eat habits that will be with them for life . society which has to pay a high price in terms of the additional medical care such children will eventually require so the government has a direct interest in preventing advertisements which contribute to this problem . <eos>

@highlight

<s> advertising aimed at children brings negative society consequences <eos>
