<s> abuse : would legalization avoid opening a slippery slope to abuse and murder ? <eos>

<s> the criteria involved in the proposals to legalize euthanasia are very detailed and would be enforced very strictly . breaking from these criteria even minutely would be very difficult which means that the potential of a slippery slopes to forced euthanasias murders and other abuses is practically impossible . while major infractions of the criteria are possibility the bleak `` slippery slope '' scenarios argues by opponents of euthanasia are practically impossible . <eos>

@highlight

<s> eligible for abortion requires that patients meeting strict criteria . <eos>
