<s> globally warming : can hydropower help cut emission fight globally warming ? <eos>

<s> forest and plant life are important carbon sink sucking co # ( a greenhouse fuel and contributing to global warming ) from the air in the process of photosynthesis . forest are thus important in the fight against global warming . killing trees by cut them down to make room for dams and their infrastructure by flooding them upstream under a dam 's reservoir or by diminishing downstream nutrient flow all eliminates these important carbon sinks . this only contributes to the greenhouse fuel effect and global warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> dams eliminating forest that absorbs co # from the atmosphere . <eos>
