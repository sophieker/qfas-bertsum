<s> choice : do vouchers introduce beneficial choices to education ? <eos>

<s> vouchers do not provide all public school student with a choice to attend private schools . private schools can intrinsically deny applicants entry . the main problems with this is that many of the most needy disadvantaged groups are already being turned away by private schools so educational vouchers may not provide them with any greater choice or accessing to private schools . public schools are open to all student and this is why the disadvantaged should be helped through the public school system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor often ca n't pay public schools even with vouchers <eos>
