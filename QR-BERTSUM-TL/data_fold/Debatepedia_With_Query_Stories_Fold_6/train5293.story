<s> oil replacement : is corn ethanol a good way to reduce oil use and dependence ? <eos>

<s> corn ethanol production demands a substantial amount of oil in the processing of corn into alcohol . corn ethanol production therefore may actually increase demand for petroleum . or at least the amount of petroleum used in the production of corn ethanol will cancel out the amount of foreign oil corn ethanol replaces . <eos>

@highlight

<s> corn ethanol production demands too much oil to lower oil dependencies <eos>
