<s> civilian presence : has china abusively militarized tibet ? <eos>

<s> china 's civilian presence in tibet is a justified response to a serious separatist threat both inside of tibet and from the tibetan governments in exile in india . this is a serious threat to the honesty and unity of china and the governments has the right to take heavy-handed action against it . if tibetans renounced their rebellious separatism the civilian presence would be unnecessary . maybe this should be the focus for change in tibet instead of independence . if tibetans became less inclined to seek independence much of the conditions that cause them to seek independence - think a civilian presence - would be ended . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china 's military is in tibetan due to the separatists threat there . <eos>
