<s> rating/voting systems -- could it be beneficial ? <eos>

<s> if implemented on a larger scale this systems could be a useful feedback for the editors -- which argument needs developing better explanation new evidence or which are well developed and accepted by the public on the other hand . also no vote has ever been neither # % reliable nor accurate -- there is no absolute truth so these words does n't even make sense in this context . vote is an expression of one 's ( possibly wrongful ) feeling about some subject . vote reflects opinion about a topic how can this possibly be accurate/inaccurate ? the outcome of a poll consequently reflects the distributed of opinion ( s ) among people -- again this distributed may be a wrongful one ( in somebody 's eyes ) but getting info about it <eos>

@highlight

<s> vote system would provide feedback . <eos>
