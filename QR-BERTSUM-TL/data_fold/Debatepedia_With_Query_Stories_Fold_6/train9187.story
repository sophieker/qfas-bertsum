<s> oils replacement : is corn ethanol a good way to reducing oils use and dependence ? <eos>

<s> corn methanol production demands a substantial amounts of oil in the processed of corn into alcohol . corn methanol production therefore may probably increase demand for petroleum . or at least the amounts of petroleum used in the production of corn methanol will cancel out the amounts of foreign oil corn methanol replaces . <eos>

@highlight

<s> corn ethanol production demands too too oil to lower oil dependencies <eos>
