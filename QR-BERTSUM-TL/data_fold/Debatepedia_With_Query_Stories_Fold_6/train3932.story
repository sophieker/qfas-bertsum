<s> nature vs. nurture ? is homosexuality natural or a society phenomena ? <eos>

<s> scott bidstrup . `` gay marriage : the arguments and the motives '' > `` homosexuality is as old as civilization itself and has always been a part of civilization including this one - indeed cross-cultural studies indicate that the percentage of homosexuals in a population is independent of culture . so even if promotions were to occur it would n't change anything - people are n't gay because they were `` recruited `` they 're gay because they were born that ways as the population statistics across cultures makes clear . as for gay marriage itself undermining western civilization it is hard to seeing how the promotions of loved dedication sharing and commonality of values and goal is n't going to strengthen civilization a lot sooner than it is going to <eos>

@highlight

<s> homosexuality is as older as civilization either . <eos>
