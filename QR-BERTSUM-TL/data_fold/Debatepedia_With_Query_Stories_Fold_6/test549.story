<s> vacation : will getting rid of summer vacation be tolerable ? <eos>

<s> one of the historical reasons for avoiding school during summer was the lack of air conditioning during summer months . this is a problem throughout the united states and southern canada particularly for older buildings . school buildings classrooms in particular tend not to be well ventilated . this is not a handicap when buildings have to be heated but is when an older building is retrofitted for summer use . room air conditioners are usually inappropriate for spaces with high ceilings and lots of volume - typical of most classrooms . they would also require electrical retrofitting . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many school buildings are not built for summer use . <eos>
