<s> businesses : will a smokers ban be fair to businesses ? <eos>

<s> smokers will not go to non-smokers places . the claim that more nonsmokers will visit bars and restaurants has been proved to be untrue . these businesses would which earn less money from selling tobacco . in many places pubs and work men s clubs are important social places for communities . the smoking ban in the uk has had a devastating effect on the pubs trade . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a smoking ban could drive those bar and restaurants out of business . <eos>
