<s> economics : are hydrogen fuel cells economical ? <eos>

<s> while individual hydrogen molecules may contain significant amounts of energy the problem is that hydrogen is very diffuse meaning that there is not much hydrogen nor energy by volume . this is why compressing or liquifying hydrogen is necessary if it is to be used to power vehicles . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hydrogen fuel is a weak energy source by volume . <eos>
