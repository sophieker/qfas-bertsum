<s> prosecution : would this lead to mass prosecutions of parents with great intentions ? <eos>

<s> a bans would not lead to a mass prosecution of parents for inconsequential smacks any more than adults are prosecuted for inconsequential assaults on other adults currently . the threat of punishment is likely to function as a deterrent and change parents ' behaviour . moreover there would be less intervention into family life by social workers than there is now . the current laws in the uk makes lawyers and prosecutors responsible for deciding if a slap hurt and thus for fine-tuning levels of acceptable violence in the home . <eos>

@highlight

<s> children would not be psychiatrists for each smack this is more of a deterrent . <eos>
