<s> civil society : does big government foster a strong society ? <eos>

<s> citizens can come together to engage in government at all levels . going to a caucus as a citizen for example and interacting with other citizens and voting for and shaping the agenda of ones political party is an incredibly powerful form of civic engagement . it binds communities mightily allowing them to come together to express their individual and common vision for their future and then enabling them to achieve these goals through collective action with the authority of the state . no other civil association has the same power so is not as capable of rallying a community together . <eos>

@highlight

<s> strong citizen-driven govt binds communities . <eos>
