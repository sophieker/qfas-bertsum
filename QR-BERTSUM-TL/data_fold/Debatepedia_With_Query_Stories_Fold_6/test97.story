<s> regional will : would allocating the delegates accordance to regional will make sense ? <eos>

<s> the presidential race was deadlocked in early # . many believe that this is bad for the democratic party as it means that the elections will drag on more attacks will be waged between the candidates and this will give fuel to the republican candidate in the general election . one way to solve this current deadlock is to allot the ohio and florida delegates according to popular will . this would give momentum to the candidate that is currently in the lead would initially help end the elections and would do so in a way that reflect most closely the national will . <eos>

<s> allotting delegates according to popular vote would help end deadlocked elections . <eos>
