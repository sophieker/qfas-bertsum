<s> should cage fighting ( or mma ) be banned for it being too violent ? <eos>

<s> `` boxing wrestling muay thai kickboxing and brazillian jiu-jitsu are all sports that are considered to be acceptable in today 's society . mixed martial arts is a sport that as it 's name suggests combines different aspects from all of these sports . it brings in striking from boxing and muay thai holds from wrestling and submissions from bjj . if all of these sports are considered to be okay then why would mma be any different ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> mixed martial arts is a completely appropriate for today 's society . <eos>
