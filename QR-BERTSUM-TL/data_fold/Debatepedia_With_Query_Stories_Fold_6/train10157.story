'' cnet . # apr . # - `` fuel cell critics point out that hydrogen is flammable but so is gasoline . unlike gasoline which can pool up and burn for a long time hydrogen dissipates rapidly . gas tanks tend to be easily punctured thin-walled containers while the latest hydrogen tanks are made from kevlar . also gaseous hydrogen is n't the only method of storage under consideration -- bmw is looking at liquid storage while other researchers are looking at chemical compound storage such as boron pellets .
