<s> funding : should space exploration be publicly funded ? <eos>

<s> even if nasa is unwilling to fund a particular project does not mean it can not take place the beagle 2 project to search for life on mars was organised by british scientist professor colin pillinger and raised a significant amount of its ? 50m cost from private sources and sponsorship . the beagle 2 never responded from the surface of the red planet but the principle of scientific communities being able to raise sufficient capital for small unmanned missions has been proven . <eos>

@highlight

<s> significant private capital can be raised for space exploration . <eos>
