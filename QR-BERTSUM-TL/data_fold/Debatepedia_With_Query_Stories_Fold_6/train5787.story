<s> past aid : are developed countries giving insufficient climate aid ? <eos>

<s> 2009 and 2010 saw an economic crisis greater than any since the great depression . this has made it very difficult for any state to contribute significant amounts of aid - climate aid or other - of any kind to poor countries . the call - on the part of the resolution - to increase climate adaptation aid must be tempered by these limitations . <eos>

@highlight

<s> increasing aid during economic crisis is untenable . <eos>
