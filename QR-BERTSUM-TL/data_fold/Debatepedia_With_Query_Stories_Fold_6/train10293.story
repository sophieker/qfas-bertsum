<s> power abuse : can adult families members engage in sexual activity from a position of equal power ? <eos>

<s> the case against incestuous couples relying too much on speculation about worst-case scenarios in which poor judgment and corrupt morals lead to abuse in the relationship . but most of these problems have nothing to do with incestuous couples specifically and could apply to any family . in any family one family member could be abusive . in any relationship one member could abuse power and possibly force another member into sex no consent . it is wrong thus to cite abuse in incestuous families as an instance of the corruption of incest itself when such abuse is consistent with what occurs in traditional families as well . it is important to instead of considering sanctity-of-life scenarios to consider if incest can be just in <eos>

@highlight

<s> bestiality law should not be framed by sanctity-of-life scenarios . <eos>
