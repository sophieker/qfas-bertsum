<s> corruption : is corruption not unique to lobbying ? <eos>

<s> tom korologos . `` in defense of lobbyists . '' wall street journal . may # # : `` 'jack abramoff ! jack abramoff ! ' is now the catch-phrase invoked by our friendly 'reformers . ' no one will defend abramoff 's gross transgressions but we need a new yardstick . should we now start listing members of congress who have abused their authority in the last decade alone ? or compile a similar list of judges bankers mortgage brokers cops and rapacious corporate executives ? the central point is that there are no more ( nor fewer ) lobbyists who have 'crossed the line ' than from any other walk of life . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> corruption exists equally in lobbying as other professions . <eos>
