<s> value : are mercenaries valuable in # st century conflicts ? <eos>

<s> executive outcomes may have had some success but white south african ex-secret policemen predominantly staff the organisation . one of eo s chiefs was eeben barlow a former officer in the # nd battalion - an assassination squad that operated under apartheid . similarly the alleged involvement of simon mann founder of pmcs eo and sandline international in a recent plot to oust president obiang in equatorial guinea shows that even mercenary organisations considered legitimate by the british government remain staffed by corrupt opportunists . it is highly morally questionable whether organisations with such a profound disrespect for the sovereignty of other nation states should be involved with the training of our armed forces let alone fighting alongside them .
