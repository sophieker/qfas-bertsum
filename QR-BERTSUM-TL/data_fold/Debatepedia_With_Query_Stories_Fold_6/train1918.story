<s> illegal immigration : does arranged marriage boost illegal immigration ? <eos>

<s> more important to remember is that these marriages last in exceptionally high numbers beyond the time required to receive a passport so they would be legitimate even in countries where marriages which are for the primary purpose of immigration are barred . finally it is totally legitimate that husbands and wives should be able to choose the country where they have the best chances of making a good life to set up their homes and this only serves to prove why brides from the third world might make the free choice to marry . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we have made pathetically small progress in stamping out mail order brides which just goes to show how completely unenforceable <eos>
