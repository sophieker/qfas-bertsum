<s> global warming : can iron fertilisation help considerably combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> the studies concluding that iron fertilisation lead to low level of dioxide sequestration suffered from numerous flaws : timing - none of the ocean trials had much boat time to monitoring their blooms for more than # days while blooms generally last # ~ # days ; scale - most trials used less than # kg of iron and thus created small blooms that were quickly devoured by opportunistic zooplankton krill and fish ; undergraduate conservatism - with limited data set scientists have not been willing to ( understandably ) extrapolate upon their findings . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trials finding low results from carbon sequestration were defective <eos>
