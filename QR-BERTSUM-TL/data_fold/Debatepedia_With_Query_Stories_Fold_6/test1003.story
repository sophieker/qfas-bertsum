<s> peer review : is wikipedia possibly better off without a formal peer-review process ? <eos>

<s> at the moment it is entirely in the hands of an individual whether he thinks a modification he intends is an improvement so there comes a point when a modification is as likely to damage the resource . if some system could be installed then you would protect against crank attacks as well as misjudgment and ensure a continually improving resource . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia should have a peer review process before edits are accepted <eos>
