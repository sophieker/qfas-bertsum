<s> car insurance analogy : are mandates analogous to car insurance mandates ? <eos>

<s> the state issues drivers licenses as a privileged . with that privilege comes responsibilities that are rightfully demanded by the state in a quid pro quo fashion such as the demand that the driver obtain auto insurance in order to protect other drivers on the road . yet there is no such contract-like quid pro quo arrangement in the case of health insurance mandates ; being alive is not a privilege like driving is and so is not something the state can bargain with in a `` quid pro quo '' fashion - licensing the right to live in exchange for a mandate to acquire health insurance . <eos>

@highlight

<s> auto insurance is `` quid pro quo '' for license to drive . <eos>
