<s> rights : which systems better protect rights ? <eos>

<s> capitalism is n't a monolithic system -- capitalism can have element of control in it . after all taxation is a capitalist creation and almost all capitalists accept a role for states regulation to prevent market rigging and to help those in absolute poverty . more broadly speaking capitalism exists within the constraints of a democratic system in which the people decide collectively -- through their government -- to place certain constraints laws and requirements on capitalism . capitalism is ultimately subservient to the democratic system and the collective ( and hopefully compassionate ) will of the citizenry . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism exist under constraints of democracy govt . <eos>
