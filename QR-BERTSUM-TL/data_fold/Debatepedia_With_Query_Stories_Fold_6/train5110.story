<s> economics : are education voucher economical efficient ? <eos>

<s> education does not fit well into a fungible supply/demand system . the main reason is that the supply of schools can not adjusting quickly to declines changes in demand . schools can not be built overnight or within even a single year . and schools can not rapidly adjusting their budgets because demand rises and falls dramatically from one years to the next via school vouchers . schools are rather long-term investments for long-term demographic trends with the objective of supplying the public with a stable public good - education . this stable supply of education should not be subjected to the whims of shifts in declines demand . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public schools are a public good ; should not be subjecting to market . <eos>
