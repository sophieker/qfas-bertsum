<s> israel : is israel 's policy of `` targeted assassination '' justified ? <eos>

<s> whenever one nation or groups attempts to assassinate the leader of another group the door is opened wide for pentor attempts . one assassinated attempting makes it too more politically legitimate for a group to respond in-kind with an assassinated attempting of their own . because it is easy politically it becomes more likely . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assassinations breed destabilising pentor attempts <eos>
