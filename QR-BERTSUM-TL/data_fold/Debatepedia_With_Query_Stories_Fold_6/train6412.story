<s> governance : can nations do a better job of governing water resources ? <eos>

<s> in order for a global commons to be established countries must realize that such a commons is in their and the world 's broader interests and voluntarily sign on to such an international agreement . as mentioned above there is a trend toward increasing support for a global commons on water resources and more countries are coming around to the concept . the only obstructions are those countries whom currently object to a global water commons . but as these opinions change the obstacles will fall and a global water commons will become increasingly attainable . <eos>

<s> if there is a will there is a way in establishing an enforceable global commons : <eos>
