<s> marriage benefits : would giving polygamous marriage benefits create problems ? <eos>

<s> regardless of whether polyamorous relationships are appropriate or if it 's appropriate for people to have polygamous marriage ceremonies in religious institutions the benefits provided by legally recognized marriage pose serious problems . a group of people such as a streets gang corrupt public officials corrupt businessmen or even a terrorist cell could get legally wife to avoid testifying against each other in court . divorce proceedings would be complicated . even if just one spouse was getting a divorce since marriage involves sharing property so the court would have to figure out who brought what into the marriage to protect the property of the spouse not getting divorced . determining child custody would also be difficult . which spouse are eligible for custody rights ? all <eos>

@highlight

<s> recognizing polygamy would cause a hosts of law problems . <eos>
