<s> punishment : could waterboarding be a fitting punishment ? <eos>

<s> while it is often claimed that a suspected terrorist is set to kill others and thus his torture is justified this does not necessarily make sense . the suspected terrorist in custody is not going to directly kill anyone . they are merely suspected to have information that could possibly lead to the interception of those that are threatening to kill others . the disconnect is so wide between the suspected terrorists and the victims that the notion of `` punishing '' the suspected terrorist in custody does not make sense . <eos>

@highlight

<s> suspected information-holders can not be punished for crimes they do not commit . <eos>
