<s> corruption : can means testing help reduce corruption and fraud ? <eos>

<s> this is especially in middle income countries with social safety nets like central and eastern europe . means testing would be another way of reporting income and triangulating accurate economic data for those countries . while the short term temptation to cheat may increase the more extensive detailed and demanding reporting methods needed for means testing will make fraud more difficult . the systems developed for means testing will reduce corruption encourage efficiency in the civil service and ultimately reduce fraud . <eos>

@highlight

<s> means testing requires better collection of income information . <eos>
