<s> is it ethical for commercial companies to offer microfinance ? <eos>

<s> commercial lenders have far more capital than a charity can hope to match and by engaging in this sector they offer the benefits of credit to far more of the worlds poorest people . this offers those people a chance to escape from poverty and in some cases this chance would not be available without commercial organisations . <eos>
