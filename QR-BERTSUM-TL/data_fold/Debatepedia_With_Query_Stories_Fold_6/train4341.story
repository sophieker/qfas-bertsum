<s> decision-making : which offers more decision-making apparatuses ? <eos>

<s> a truly socialist society would be far more versatile and flexible than any capitalist one . since there would be no classes and decisions would be made by the people they would be able to make decisions that would best avert the crisis for the average people not the elites ( like in capitalism or fake socialism ) . and since decision making would be truly democratic it would be easy to change things about the society if everyone wanted it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> socialism can effectively respond to crises . <eos>
