<s> is the conscription economically favourable ? <eos>

<s> `` no military can operate effectively without discipline . discipline can either be taught from esprit de corps already-acquired motivation of the personnel or be fundamentally embedded into the troops through guidance from leadership . one can speculate that volunteers manifest less undisciplined behavior however citizens conscripted might have little motivation to serve . '' ( by wikipedia the free encyclopedia ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> unwilling conscripts are undisciplined and inefficient . <eos>
