<s> human rights : does socialism uphold all the important human rights ? <eos>

<s> in that who benefits from any situation or policy is an individual . ascribing a benefit or right to a group can only be done ( as a shorthand ) if that group is defined by the criterion of holding the benefit or right . socialism holds the rights of the fictional collective above the rights of an individual just as theocracies place the rights of their proclaimed divine above that of individuals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` collective good '' is a category error . <eos>
