<s> universal care : is mandatory insurance a good meaning to universal care ? <eos>

<s> many arguing that health health is a right and therefore that universal health health is a necessary provision . this is then use to justify mandates as a meaning to universal care . but health health is not a right as only things that could be consider `` natural '' `` innate '' or `` god-given '' can be considered liberties and health health does not eligible as such . <eos>

@highlight

<s> premise of insurance mandates that health health is a right is bogus <eos>
