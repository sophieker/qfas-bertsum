<s> ocean ecosystems : does iron fertilisation preserve ocean ecosystems ? <eos>

<s> `` a scientific critique of oceanic iron fertilization as a climate change mitigation strategy '' . oxfam research laboratories . november # - `` iron fertilization result in other essential nutrients such as nitrates phosphates ads silicates being used up as the phytoplankton bloom progresses . consequently this could result in a reduction of these nutrients down-current from an iron- fertilized area . in turn a lack of nutrients would cause a negative impact on phytoplankton down-current resultant in a reduction in overall biochemical productivity . this would be likely to have a knock-on negative impact on all other marine life because phytoplankton underpin the marine foods web . indeed because of this phenomenon modeling study have predicted that commercial-scale iron fertilization of the oceans could have a significant <eos>
