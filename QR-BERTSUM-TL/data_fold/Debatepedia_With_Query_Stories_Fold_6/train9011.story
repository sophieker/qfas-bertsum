<s> cold war : is it wrong to think that the bombings were the first move in cold war ? <eos>

<s> a number of scientists who worked on the bomb were against its use . led by dr. james franck seven scientists submitted a report to the interim committee ( which advised the president ) in may 1945 saying : `` if the united states were to be the first to release this new means of indiscriminate destruction upon mankind she would sacrifice public support throughout the world precipitate the race for armaments and prejudice the possibility of reaching an international agreement on the future control of such weapons . '' <eos>

@highlight
