<s> happiness : are lawyers happy ? <eos>

<s> steven butler . `` is being a lawyer worth it ? '' helium . january 30th 2009 : `` minimum billable hour expectations at large law firms whether by stated policy or not are typically around 2 000 hours per year . this target does not include time worked on pro-bono matters training attention to non-billable firm marketing and related projects and general administrative work around the office . the pay may be incredible but the hours are rough - making the deal not as attractive on a `` dollars per hour in the office '' ( or chained to your cell phone and blackberry ) basis . the psychological and physical costs of this lifestyle are real and do n't typically fit well alongside goals of having a happy life outside the office . '' <eos>
