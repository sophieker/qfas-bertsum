<s> politics : does ( and should ) the vox vox matter ? <eos>

<s> democracy allows the people to have a direct say in who governs them via the votes cast by every adult member of the population . as such it ensures that a government is made up of those whom are truly representative of the people and ensures that no minority military power or elite is able to oppress them . if we accept that we all have the same rights then it follows we should all have an equal say in who represents we in choosing how we are governed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democratic prevents unfair mob peace . <eos>
