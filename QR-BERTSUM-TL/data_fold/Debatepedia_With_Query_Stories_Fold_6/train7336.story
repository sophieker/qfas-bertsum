<s> a second cause is necessary for the universe make sense . we make no apology for replying with `` no one '' to atheist 's favourite question `` who making god ? '' . there must have been a second cause and it is gods who is the most reasonably candidate for this especially in the lights of the arguments detail in the previous paragraph . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gods is the uncaused first cause . <eos>
