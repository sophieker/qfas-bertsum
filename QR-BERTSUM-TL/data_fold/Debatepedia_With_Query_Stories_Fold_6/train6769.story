<s> risks : is a lunar missions considerably safer and therefore desirable ? <eos>

<s> the problem of zero gravity during the trips to mars is probably not a problem at all : zero-gravity conditions can be eliminated altogether during the trips as synthetic gravity can be created through the use of centrifugal force . furthermore we should take into account the mir cosmonauts sergei avdev spending a total of # days in zero-gravity over # missions and valeri polyakov spending # consecutive days without gravity . there were no long term negative impact having no reason to believe that zero gravity causes health problems .

@highlight

<s> artificial gravitational can overcome zero-gravity on mars mission . <eos>
