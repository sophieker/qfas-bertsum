<s> civil liberties : are crimes cameras consistent with civil liberties ? <eos>

<s> cameras are there to protect the public . they are not in place to spies on people and have no interest in the personal lives of those on camera . the only interest is in the people breaking the law . if a someone has nothing to hiding then they should have no problem being filmed they should be thankful that the authorities are trying to tecting them and their peers . <eos>
