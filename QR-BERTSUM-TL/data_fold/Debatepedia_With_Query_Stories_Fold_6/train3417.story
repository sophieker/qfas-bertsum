<s> economics : is veal farming an economically important industry ? <eos>

<s> the government should not intervene where the markets are more capable of doing so . if land-use is a problem and if cattle take up more land per calorie produced than other forms of produce than we would expect the price of meet to rise significantly relative to other agricultural goods . this would cause the demand for cattle and meat to fall which would lower the production of cattle and veal and the land used in the production of these goods . such a market-based response to heavy cattle land-use is better than any governmental response to the problem . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if cattle land-use is a problem the markets are best for solving the problem . <eos>
