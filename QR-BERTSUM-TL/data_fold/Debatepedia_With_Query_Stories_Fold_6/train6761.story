<s> the idea that some countries are more to blame than others for causing global warming change be be truth but it distracts from the more important and just cause which is for the world to come them to solve the problems and to adapt as successfully as possible . bickering over debts causes poor countries to wait for handouts and to debate the issue instead of causing them to take direct action on their own . <eos>
