<s> individuals rights : are insurance mandated consistently with individuals rights ? <eos>

<s> the uninsured do two things that add to costs . first when they do go to the hospital they go to the emergency room which is paid for by the taxpayers in most cases . second by not contributing money to the terms risk pool the insured have a smaller pool of resources to draw on when they get sick meaning that insurances companies have to increased premiums . <eos>

@highlight

<s> premiums increased costs for all ; mandates are appropriate . <eos>
