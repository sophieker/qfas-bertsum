<s> foreign policy : <eos>

<s> `` goldberg : obama abroad is adrift . '' la times . november # th # : `` there 's something peculiar about obama 's foreign policy : there does n't seem to be one . talking about libya ben rhodes the director for strategic communications at the national security council told the new york times : 'we 've resisted the notion of a doctrine because we do n't think you can impose one model on very different countries ; that gets you into trouble and can lead you to intervene in places that you should n't . ' this strikes me as wildly overstated even bizarre . a doctrine in and of itself does n't compelled anyone to do anything . '' <eos>
