<s> schools choice : does nclb offer better choice of schools to student and parents ? <eos>

<s> under-performing children often have no choice to transfers from another school to one when all schools are `` underperforming '' or `` failing '' in which case schools frequently deny under-performing students accessing - as a means of keeping up their school 's tests scores so as to avoid being labelled `` failing '' and punished . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` failing '' school will not accept `` failing '' students . <eos>
