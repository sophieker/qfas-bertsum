<s> due dessert ? does plea bargaining in exchange for testimony violates the notion of due dessert ? <eos>

<s> this notion holds that specific crimes and circumstances should lead to or deserve specific punishments . only when caused desert is applied can it be said that judicial is served . plea bargaining reaches settlements that are not an exacting measure of what a criminal deserves but simply of what can be satisfactorily agreed forth between the prosecutor and defendant . the punishment falling someplace in the middle of these parties instead of on a place of caused desert and justice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> plead bargaining violates the law notions of due desert : <eos>
