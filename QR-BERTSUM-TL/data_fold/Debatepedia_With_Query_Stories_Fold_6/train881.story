<s> download speech : is pornography protected by download speech ? <eos>

<s> pornography encourages unhealthy objectifying attitudes towards the opposite sex . in this way it is naive to suppose that pornography is a criminalized crime ; the victim is the very fabric of society either . by victimizing others pornography forsakes any claims to the protection of `` free speech '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> porn not victimless ; limited free speeches protections . <eos>
