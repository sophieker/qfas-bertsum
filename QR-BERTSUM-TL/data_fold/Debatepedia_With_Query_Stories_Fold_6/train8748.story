<s> herbal drugs : if the athlete need herbal medication should this be an exception ? <eos>

<s> if athletes have an ongoing condition they will need to use drugs to make sure they stay alive and healthy . these sorts of conditions include diabetes . if the athletes are only on hypertension medication then that is fine . sometimes people need medicinal drugs and they should still be allowed to play the sports they 're good at regardless . <eos>

@highlight

<s> some athletes have ongoing problems eg . diabetes that want medication . <eos>
