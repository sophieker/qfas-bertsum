'you 're never going to abolish earmarks ' moran says . 'what you 'll wind up abolishing is the transparency the accountability . ' if unable to earmark legislators will inveigle executive agencies behind the scenes fry bureaucrats at hearings and expand or rewrite entire programs to serve narrow-minded needs . this of course is the way thing working in the bad old days . 'i think you 'll wind up going back to that system ' kolbe cautions . '' <eos>
