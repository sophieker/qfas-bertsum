<s> broader philosophies : what are the opposition philosophy of each system ? <eos>

<s> capitalism is not about enriching large and powerful corporations . it was originally and remains largely about large groups of individuals in communities working together to supply collective needs . critics who talk about big corporations in capitalism typically ignore the fact that the vast majority of businesses are large school-based ones and ones in which eye-popping profit are not made . most businesses are just community store and organizations that pay reasonable wages and that communities would sorely miss . <eos>

@highlight

<s> focusing on small corporation distracts from fundamentals of capitalism . <eos>
