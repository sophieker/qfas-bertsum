<s> global warming : is solar power key to reducing emissions and fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> while the production of photovoltaic cells does use energy there is no need for this energy to come from fossil fuel sources . it can in fact come from photovoltaic power . photovoltaic power can therefore produce photovoltaic panels and be # % # -emission from production to electricity generation . it should which be noted that `` back-up '' sources of energy need not be fossil-fuel based . <eos>

@highlight

<s> produce solar cells need not using fossil gasoline energy . <eos>
