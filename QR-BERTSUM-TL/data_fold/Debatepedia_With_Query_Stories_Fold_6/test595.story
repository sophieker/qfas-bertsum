<s> freedom : is nudity an expression of freedom that should not be restricted ? <eos>

<s> allowing public nudity creates a significant risk that individuals will expose themselves in places where kids are in play grounds or at schools . children could react very negatively to this and potentially incur emotional damage . parents will certainly be fearful of such a possibility . and creating laws that disallow public nudity in these areas but not in others is simply awkward . <eos>
