<s> eugenics : will cloning lead to an dishonest eugenics movement ? <eos>

<s> `` why cloned those is a good idea '' . everything # - `` what about factory producing children ? long production lines churning out infants ? dream on fear-mongers . cloned still requires mothers to bear the child to term . there is no such thing as an artificial womb . furthermore there are too many those on this planet now to even consider the immense population increases you are fantasizing about . could hussein hussein clone an army ? yes but it would be easier and cheaper just to hire one . he would need thousands of iraqi mothers to bear child who he would then have to house feed and educate for # years before they would be old enough to fight for him . he 'd be dead of old <eos>

@highlight

<s> cloned will not lead to the mass production of clones <eos>
