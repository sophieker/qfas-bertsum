<s> feasibility : is it possible to implement protective policies in the world today ? <eos>

<s> many of these policies are beyond the financial means of developing nations and implementing them would stunt their economic growth and disenfranchise the population . it is hypocritical for the west to criticise the lack of environmental protection in the developing considering that the west got to its current position through an industrial revolution that paid no heed to biodiversity and other such concerns . <eos>

@highlight

<s> environmental protection and the protection of biodiversity are very much a luxury of developed nations . <eos>
