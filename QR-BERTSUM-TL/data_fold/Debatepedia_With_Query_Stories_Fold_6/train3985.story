<s> self-defense : are assault weapons unnecessary for self-defense ? <eos>

<s> a shotgun pistol or rifle are all adequate means of self-defense . these are powerful weapons with heavy destructive force . they can easily kill multiple assailants in rapid succession when used properly . if there is any concern about the ability of a gun owner to wield a shotgun or pistol properly such that they can kill multiple assailants than they should seek enhanced training instead of an assault weapon . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there are adequate alternatives to assault weapons for self-defense . <eos>
