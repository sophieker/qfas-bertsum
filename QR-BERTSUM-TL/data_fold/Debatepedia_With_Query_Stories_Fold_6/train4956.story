<s> student measurement : are standardized tests a good measures of student learning ? <eos>

<s> `` commentary : no child left out need revision '' . mcclatchy . december # # - `` schools should be judged on whether each child progresses from one year to the next which is called a 'growth model . ' it asks did the child 's knowledge and skills grow at than one year 's worth ? are children who are out getting enough attention to help them catch up ? those are the important questions not whether this third grade scores better than the previous year 's third-grade class [ under no child left behind ] . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> k-12 does not track progress of individual students . <eos>
