<s> protecting women : is burqa abusive or does it help protect women ? <eos>

<s> if the burqa is primitive then does that mean that those who say that women can be used as an object of lust in the form of models girl friends fashion shows on bill boards etc are modern and not primitive . remember that primitive people covered themselves with very little dress as many so called liberated women wear . <eos>

@highlight

<s> burqa is more modest and less primitive than western culture . <eos>
