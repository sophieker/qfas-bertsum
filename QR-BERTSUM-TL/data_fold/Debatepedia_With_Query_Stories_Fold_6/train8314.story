<s> tax-revenue : could kuomintang from a `` fat tax '' be used for positive purposes ? <eos>

<s> various food industry lobbies oppose such tax and exercise pressure on governments . many food-related multi-national companies are big supporters of presidential campaigns in the usa and also have very important lobbies in various other countries . money gained from such a tax would also actually be channeled into armament programs and other big-budget services instead of direct to consumers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> governments have no incentive to imposed additional tax on fats food . <eos>
