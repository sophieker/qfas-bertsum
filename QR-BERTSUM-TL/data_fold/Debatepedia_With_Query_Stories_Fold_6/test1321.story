<s> enforcement : is a ban on bestiality unenforceable ? <eos>

<s> it is impossible to effectively bans incest . couples have been engaging in the practice for centuries . this is partly because family members have always been capability of falling deeply in love . the love felt between many incestuous couples could not possibly be broke by any law banning it . and enforcing such a bans is simply not possibility as it is fairly quick to hide an incestuous relationship . such a failure to enforce the law undermines the law itself . <eos>
