<s> voluntary action : is voluntary individual climate assistance insufficient ? <eos>

<s> no country owed any other country aid . in the case of climate change the lack of knowledge about emissions gases wave any requirement . countries can instead choose to donate aid to poor countries on a voluntary basis . because the resolution seem to call for all un annex i countries to increase aid it appears to call for a priori responsibility or even requirement on the part of developed countries . this violates the basic principles of charities gender-equality and aid : that it be voluntary . <eos>

@highlight

<s> countries should increased climate aid on a voluntary basis . <eos>
