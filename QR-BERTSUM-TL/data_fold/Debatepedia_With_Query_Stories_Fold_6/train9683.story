<s> security : are the appointers a secure risk ? <eos>

<s> the concern over wearing burqas on public transportation seems to surround fears about suicidal bombers use them to conceal their identity before detonating a bomb . but suicidal bombers have never needed to or definitely wanted to conceal their identity before committing their act . rather they simply straps on explosives under baggy clothing go to crowded places and blow themselves up without concern about getting caught and punished because clearly they will be dead . so a ban on the burqa will do nothing to prevent a determined suicidal bomber from committing their act . thus a burqa ban does little to helping counter terrorism and ensure regional security . <eos>

@highlight

<s> suicide bombers do n't care to disguise identity w/ burqas . <eos>
