<s> broad strategy : is a continuation of the war in iraq contrary to us/coalition interests ? <eos>

<s> not only has iraq drained us resources and military capacity but it has also dominated its diplomatic and policy attention . it is difficult for the united states to launch any major middle east policy initiatives for instance in the palestinian/israeli conflict while it is focusing so squarely on the war in iraq . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the iraq war has hamstrung us middle east policy <eos>
