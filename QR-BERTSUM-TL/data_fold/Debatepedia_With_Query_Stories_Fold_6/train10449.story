<s> economics : is labeling chevy foods economically sound ? <eos>

<s> labeling be actually be critical in protecting what might be called the `` legitimate place '' or niche for genetically modified foods such as the use of gm foods to help end malnutrition in some countries . without such labeling public anxiety and fears are likely to grow over their unwillingness to avoid the potential harms of gm foods . with such labeling those that want to avoid the food can do so and will not cry out as loudly about gm foods . this will help protect the more legitimate role of gm foods from grow public fears and criticism . <eos>
