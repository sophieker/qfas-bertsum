<s> margaret pantley . `` there is more breast in the media than seen during breastfeeding . '' on opposing views.com : `` breastfeeding women are routinely asked to cover their babies or retiring to a bathroom stalls in the names of decency . at the same time magazines and movie routinely showcase breasts as glamorous . a woman at work often shows more cleavage than is exposed during breastfeeding and a summer beach is a sea of nearly-naked breasts . this is a baffling double standard . why are some people so afraid of seeing a breastfeeding mother ? '' <eos>
