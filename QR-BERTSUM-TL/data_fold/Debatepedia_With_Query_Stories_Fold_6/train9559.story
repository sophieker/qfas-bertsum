<s> culture : is bullfighting a culture artistic practice ? <eos>

<s> many traditions have been defend for their cultural traditionally value . stoning women for immodesty is another of them . we know very well that such tradition-for-tradition's-sake arguments are debunk . the same holds true with bullfighting a tradition that is based on cruelty to bulls . <eos>

@highlight

<s> culture tradition is no justification for brutal bullfights <eos>
