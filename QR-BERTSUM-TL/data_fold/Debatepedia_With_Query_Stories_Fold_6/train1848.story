<s> children : are the offspring of adulterous marriage healthy or at-risk ? <eos>

<s> definitively determining beyond a reasonable doubt that incest is the cause of a specific defect in the children of an incestuous couple is very difficult . this makes it impossible to base a bans on incest on the presumption that incest is the cause of defects . <eos>

@highlight

<s> incest is not quickly determined as cause of defect . <eos>
