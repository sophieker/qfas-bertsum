<s> vs. `` non-treatment '' : is abortion good than withdrawing life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> this means that withdraw life-support should never be equivalent in intention to euthanasia . that is it should never have the explicit purposes of ending a life . in terri shiavo 's case for instance the explicit purposes of withdraw life-support was to end her life . this was wrong and is the reason why it was so widely opposed . instead withdraw life support or denying it from the beginning must be about a broader desire to for instance live life naturally and without artificial support spend as much when as possible with family without the interruption of life-support or to live life naturally without the interruptions discomfort or pain of life support . and of course withdraw or denying life-support can also including died <eos>

@highlight

<s> withdrawing life-support should not be to ends life but for other purpose <eos>
