<s> climate change : can nuclear energy help reduce emissions fight climate change ? <eos>

<s> fossil fuels are not inherently required in mining uranium and building nuclear plants . it just so happens that all modern machinery and vehicles involved in this process are powered by fossil fuels . yet these fossil-fuel-based machinery can be replaced by electric vehicles and machinery possibly supplied by nuclear power plants themselves . in sum nuclear energy is inherently clean . it is only the processes surrounding it that are dirty . this can and will change . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear energy has a carbon footprint but it is negligible . <eos>
