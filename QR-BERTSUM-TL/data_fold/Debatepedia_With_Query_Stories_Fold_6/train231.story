<s> this is one of the great contradictions of warming change : that while developed countries caused it poor countries may suffer the most . this is because many of the worst effects may happen around the equator where the impacts of drought and flooding may be most severe on aquifers and on crops and food supply . due to this irony/unfairness developed nations are particularly burdens to provide warming assistance to helping poor nations adapt . <eos>
