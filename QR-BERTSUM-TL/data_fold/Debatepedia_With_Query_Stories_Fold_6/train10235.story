<s> debt : do developed states have a responsibility to increased aid ? <eos>

<s> it does n't matters whether a country is developing or developed . this is not the factor that obligates a country to take up a `` higher '' responsibility for combating global warming and assisting in adaption . perhaps countries that emit the most - whether developed or developing - contribute more to climate change and so have a greater obligations to combat it and aid in adaptation efforts . <eos>

@highlight

<s> low emitters not develop countries are most obligated . <eos>
