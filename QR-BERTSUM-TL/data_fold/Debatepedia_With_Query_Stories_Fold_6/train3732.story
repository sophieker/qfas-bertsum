<s> rights : do # year-old citizens have a right to running for office ? <eos>

<s> in a democracy the right to hold offices is given by voters . if voter decide to elect an # year old their vote of confidence is a sufficient demonstrations of his or her qualifications and right to govern . and even if an # year old elected official makes mistakes due to his or her inexperience complaints are not appropriate given the fact that a democratic vote was cast in favor of the candidate . furthermore we should trust the voters to be capable of making judgments about candidates . if there is reason to believe that an # year old candidate is too young and inexperienced then we should trust that the voters will recognize this fact and vote for another candidate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the right to holding offices is same by voters not mandate . <eos>
