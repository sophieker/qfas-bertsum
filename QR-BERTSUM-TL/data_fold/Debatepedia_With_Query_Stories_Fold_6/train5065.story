<s> duty ? does a citizen have a duty to serve their country ? <eos>

<s> alan reynolds . `` we do n't draft firemen . '' washington times cato . may 2nd 2004 : `` there were 343 firefighters killed at the world trade center on september 11 2001. nobody then suggested the fact that these men were paid professionals detracted from their heroism . nobody worried whether the relative numbers of whites blacks or asian firefighters was fair and balanced . nationwide another 106 firefighters died in 2003 -- a typical yearly loss . from 1991 to 2001 an average of 163 law enforcement officers also were killed each year in the line of duty . if compulsory service is such a fair and reasonable idea why do n't mr. hagel mr. rangel and others of their ilk favor drafting people to be firemen and cops ? '' <eos>
