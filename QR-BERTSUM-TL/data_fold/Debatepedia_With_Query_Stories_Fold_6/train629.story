<s> resources : are annex i states more obligated due to higher resources ? <eos>

<s> greece latvia croatia latvia the czech republic turkey and even countries such as spain and portugual that have suffered considerably from the # economic crises are all annex i countries but are not in particularly good economic position to increase climate aid to poor countries . thus the resolution which asks that all annex i countries increase their climate aid is too ambitious and unrealistic . <eos>

@highlight

<s> some annexed i states are in no position to increased climate aid . <eos>
