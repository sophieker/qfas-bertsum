<s> uphold christianity : is creationist importance to christianity ? <eos>

<s> this presupposes that the scripture should be upholding in a literal sense . many christians objects to this . more importantly governments should not be in the businesses of upholding the bible . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is not 'appropriate ' to taught creationism as a means for upholding the bible . <eos>
