<s> environment : is the three gorges dams benefited the environment ? <eos>

<s> when droughts occur in china as occured in # garbage can pile up in the basin behind the damn . then when the basin begins to filling back up with water this garbage is lifted to float on the surface where it is both visually unappealing and harmful to the environment . the damage is particularly acute for locally conservation that suffer from higher chemical levels in their habitats or that become ensnared in the garbage and die . <eos>

@highlight

<s> floating trash is piled up out the tgd <eos>
