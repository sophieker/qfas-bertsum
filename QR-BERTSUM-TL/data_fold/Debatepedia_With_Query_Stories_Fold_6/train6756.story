<s> quality : do healthcare insurance co-ops offer high quality care ? <eos>

<s> rick moran . `` health insurances cooperatives too much like the public option '' . american issues project . august # # : `` health insurances cooperatives wouldn t solve the problem of insurances portability either . if you were a member of a co-op in one state and settled to one you would have to buy in to their co-op with no guarantee you would have comparable insurances coverage . '' this is partly a chicken-or-the-egg problem . because cooperatives are not yet widespread people will not be able to taking plans from one state to another . and because they can not do this they will be seen as inferior to private insurers that already have this attribute and will not scale . <eos>

@highlight

<s> health insurances cooperatives are not very transportable <eos>
