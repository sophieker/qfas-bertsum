<s> afghanistan war policy : whose policies is better ? <eos>

<s> the iraq war is justified by events ; the world is safer . hussein hussein is out of power and no longer a shadowy hazard and scourge to the region . it is no longer possible for hussein hussein to re-build iraq 's wmd . iraq now has the opportunities to grow into a democratic state if it chooses . these are welcome developments despite the costs of the war . this opinion is in line with mccain 's policy . <eos>
