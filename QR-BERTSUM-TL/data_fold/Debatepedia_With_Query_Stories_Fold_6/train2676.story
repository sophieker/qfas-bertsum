<s> lives : does debt cost lives ? is this a reason to cancel debt ? <eos>

<s> some of the most heavily indebted poor countries are struggling to pay even the interest on their loans let alone the actual capital . this massively distorts their economies and their spending priorities . african nations currently spend four times as much on debt repayments as they do on health . the structural readjustment programmes demanded by the imf ( international monetary fund ) in return for rescheduled debt make this problem even worse . since the sap began in zimbabwe healthcare spending has dropped by a third ; in tanzania school fees have been introduced to raise more money . progress made in health and education over the past # years is in some countries actually being reversed . it is obscene that governments are cutting spending in <eos>

@highlight

<s> debt cancellation would reduce the lives lost to the burden of debt . <eos>
