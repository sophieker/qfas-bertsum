<s> cap : will enlargement fit with commonly agricultural policy ? <eos>

<s> this is where lands and labour costs and environmental standards are much higher than in the east . the prospect of new entrants receive vast subsidies under the common agricultural policy ( current cost $ # million per annum ) would make this danger worse while the collapse or reduction of the cap under the strain of expansion would be catastrophic . not only would a collapse of the farming industries of previous members be an economic and strategic disaster it would have grave environmental consequences . <eos>

@highlight

<s> expansion could decimate agriculture in western europe . <eos>
