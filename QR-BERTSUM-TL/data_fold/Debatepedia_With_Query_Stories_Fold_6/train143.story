<s> robert voas . `` there 's no benefit to lowering the drinking age '' . christian scientific monitor . january # # - `` if bars and liquor stores can freely provide alcohol to teenagers parents will be out of the loops when it comes to their children 's decisions about drinking . age # laws are designed to keep such decisions within the family where they belong . our societies particularly our children and grandchildren will be immeasurably better off if we not only leave the minimum drinking age laws as it is but enforce it better too .
