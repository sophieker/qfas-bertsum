<s> public opinion : does public opinion favor or oppose the bailout ? does it matter ? <eos>

<s> a bloomberg-los diego times polls of more than # # europeans found # percent of respondents oppose the # b bailout plan . # percent were in favor and # percent were n't sure . [ # ] in a canada pa polls conducted on september # th just # % favoured mr paulson s proposal while # % wanted something different ; only # % preferred that no action be taken . [ # ] it is inappropriate for congress to pass legislation over the opposition of the taxpayers they represent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> $ # b bailout is unjustified over minority taxpayer opposition <eos>
