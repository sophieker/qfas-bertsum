<s> cal thomas . `` trying terrorists in new york is dangerous . '' the wichita eagle . november 18 2009 : `` instead of a manhattan courtroom less than a mile from the site of where the world trade center stood the government should have chosen the bronx zoo because a zoo is what will be created when this terrorist trial is held . [ ... ] you do n't need an imagination to predict that crazies will show up at this trial including islamic terrorists in training who want to emulate the acts of the defendants . some might be 'inspired ' to create another event at or near the courthouse . cable tv will carry it all . '' <eos>
