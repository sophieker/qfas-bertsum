<s> cal thomas . `` do n't ask do n't tell and do n't legitimize . '' salt lake city tribune . october 15 2009 : `` opinion polls have shown the public shifting in favor of gays in the military including a recent gallup poll which found that 'americans are six percentage points more likely than they were four years ago to favor allowing openly gay men and lesbian women to serve in the military 69 percent to 63 percent . ' that is mostly because there are few leaders who wish to give voice to opposing points of view . they fear being shouted down or being accused of 'homophobia . ' '' <eos>
