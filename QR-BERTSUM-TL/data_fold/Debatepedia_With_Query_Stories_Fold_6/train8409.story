<s> symbol : do civil unions unfairly deprive the symbol of `` marriage '' ? <eos>

<s> steve swayne . `` the case for federal civil unions . '' independent gay forum . february # # : `` when congress starts to consider the fma here 's hoping a courageous lawmaker will introduce a federal civil union bill . let 's debate whether gay couples merit equality under the law not whether straight couples can keep the word marriage to themselves . let 's discuss the special rights that empty-nest and childless straight couples currently enjoy and seriously examine what happens if we extend these rights to gay couples with children .

<s> civil unions give what matters : equal benefits not `` marriage '' <eos>
