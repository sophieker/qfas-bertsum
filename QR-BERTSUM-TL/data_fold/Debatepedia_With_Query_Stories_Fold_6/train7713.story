<s> colleges/applicants : should colleges search applicant profiles on social networking sites ? <eos>

<s> consent is a significant element of the admissions process . a contract of sorts is entered between the candidate and college in which relevant information is supplied by the candidate . relevant information can be checked through official third-party sources such as the sats and high schools . this remains consensual because the applicant entered into a disclosure agreement with their high school and the preparers of the sats which gives authority to admissions officers to view relevant information about the applicant . but no such contract is established if an admissions officer `` snoops '' onto a profile . it thus breaks the mold of consent and acceptability in the admissions process . <eos>
