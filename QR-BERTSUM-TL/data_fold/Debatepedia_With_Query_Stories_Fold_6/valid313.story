<s> costs : is capital punishment economically justifiable and cost-effective ? <eos>

<s> no criminal wants to die and any attempt to save a persons life can not be deemed frivolous nor inappropriate simply on account of the costs . the mass amount of appeals created are to be blamed on the judicial system not the criminal . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no such thing as a frivolous appeal of the death penalty . <eos>
