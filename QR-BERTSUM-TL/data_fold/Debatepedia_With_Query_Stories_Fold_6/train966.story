<s> impending threat ? - is it `` imminent '' that iran will produce nuclear weapons ? <eos>

<s> iran 's history of defiance anonymity and deception surrounding its nuclear program undermine its claim that its nuclear pursuits are peaceful and legitimate . additional factors such as the low need for nuclear electricity in iran due to abundant fossil gasoline electricity as well as iran 's rejection of international deals that would provide external sources of uranium gasoline undermine iran 's claim to a peaceful nuclear electricity program . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iranian is seeking reactors weapons not merely reactors energy . <eos>
