<s> individuals liberty : should individuals be at liberty to use marijuana ? <eos>

<s> people should be at liberty to treat their body how they want to . indeed people are allowed to eat and drink to their detriment and even death so why should n't they be able to harm themselves with marijuana use ? this is of course assuming that their use does not harm anyone else . this means as with substance such as alcohol or cigarrettes that regulations be put in place to ensure that one individual 's consumption of marijuana does not violate the freedoms of another citizen . if this is achievable with alcohol and cigarettes it seems achievable with marijuana . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people should be free to use marijuana as long as it harms no another else <eos>
