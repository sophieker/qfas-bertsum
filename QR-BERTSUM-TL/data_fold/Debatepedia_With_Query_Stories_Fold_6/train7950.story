<s> billie bender . `` was israel s flotillas raid illegally or legally ? '' tufts roundtable . june # nd # : `` if you support gaza . then you believe that israel is 'occupying ' hamas and israel is in violation of international laws because it is denying hamas s sovereign right to trade and aid . '' [ from this you can then arguing that israel had no right to board the flotillas in international waters and therefore that the raid was illegally under international law . ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> blockades of gaza is illegal ca n't justify flotilla raid <eos>
