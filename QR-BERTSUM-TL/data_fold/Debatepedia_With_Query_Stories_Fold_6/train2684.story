<s> regional war ? could an early withdrawal avoid causing a regional war ? <eos>

<s> the countries surrounding iraq do not want to jeopardize their oil revenues with their involvement in a regional war . oil is their only source of revenue . a regional war would disrupt oil supply and would drive up oil prices substantially which could be financially damaging . <eos>

@highlight

<s> regional powers would prefer stability in iraq to protect their oil industries <eos>
