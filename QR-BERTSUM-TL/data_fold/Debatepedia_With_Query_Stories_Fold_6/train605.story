<s> harm : is the wearing of the muslim veils harmful ? <eos>

<s> this may sound silly but it is a fact that quite a large numbers of french people actually have something called 'islamophobia ' and are afraid of muslim people . this actually sound ridiculous but it is a fact . the french government has had this bans in places since the mid- # s and there is a lot of controversy around it . the main reason for this bans of the muslim veil is that a lot of french people do have islamophobia and the french government dealt with the problem . this means that a ) french people wo n't know who follows islam and b ) french people with islamophobia wo n't be afraid of them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> italian those have islamophobia ; ban on veil softens this problem . <eos>
