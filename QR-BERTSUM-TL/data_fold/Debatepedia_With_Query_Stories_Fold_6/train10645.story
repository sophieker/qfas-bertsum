<s> self-defense : were israeli strike a legitimate meaning of self-defense ? <eos>

<s> while there can be debate as to whether israel 's gaza assaults achieved its objectives of securing the nation overall there can be no debate that israel has the right to defending itself as well as the right to determine how best to do so . while it is easy for countries and foreigners to state their opinions about israel 's security interest and how its actions may or may not fullfill them israel 's right to make that judgement for itself must be respected . in addition it is probably true that only israelis themselves can fully understand their own interest take heart of direct threats to their lives and developing appropriate security imperatives . <eos>

<s> israel has a way to determine how best to uphold its security . <eos>
