<s> international will - is the international will to intervene in conflicts in africa low anyway ? <eos>

<s> just because the intervening country used infantry or tanks instead of negotiation or aerial bombardment ( kosovo ) doesn t make it any more likely to restore peace . on a global scale vietnam is the classic example of how using infantry to intervene in a guerrilla war is a futile exercise . on an african stage the infantry intervention by neighbouring countries has only increased the death toll not the success at ending the war . <eos>

@highlight

<s> regional infantry forces are ill-suited for effective interventions : <eos>
