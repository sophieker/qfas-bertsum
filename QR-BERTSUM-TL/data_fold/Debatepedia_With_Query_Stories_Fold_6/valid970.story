<s> science : does a manned mission to mars have scientific value ? <eos>

<s> because a robotic missions to mars is so much cheaper than a manned missions those more unmanned missions can be sent . the mars rovers missions cost about $ # million a pop . an optimistic estimate takes the cost of send humans to mars at $ # billion . others know it could cost as much as a trillion dollars . that is # mars rovers missions . this means that a manned missions will probably obtain nearly # / # th of the scientific data and possibly # / # th of the scientific knowledge and progress . a manned missions therefore is decidedly unscientific in this regard .
