<s> good government - does proportionally representation lead to better governance ? <eos>

<s> typically no one party gains a majority of the popular voting so coalition governments have to be formed often between three or more parties . this tends to produce unstable governments changing as parties leave or join the governing coalition and frequent elections . governments are unable to put a clear positive legislative agendas in place over numerous years or act decisively in when of crisis . compare this to the strong governing majorities produced by first past the post e.g . labour # - # or thatcher in the uk in the # s.

@highlight

<s> proportional representation and coalition government are weaker . <eos>
