<s> democracy : will lisbon improve the democratic practices of eu ? <eos>

<s> sally mcnamara . `` the eu reform treaty : a threat to the transatlantic alliance '' . heritage foundation . february # # - `` the notion that the people of europe should not have a vote on a treaty with huge implications for the future of the continent demonstrates the utter contempt that the brussels bureaucracy has for the average man or woman on the street . there is no doubt that if the treaty were put to a popular vote the electorates of several countries would reject it . the whole `` european project '' is fundamentally undemocratic unaccountable and opaque . if subjected to referenda across the eu it would almost certainly be consigned to the dustbin of history .
