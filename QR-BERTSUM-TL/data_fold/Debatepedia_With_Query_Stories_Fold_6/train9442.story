<s> feasibility : is it possible to abolishing the veto power ? <eos>

<s> the abolition of the power of veto is highly unlikely . the p # states will not willingly cede their pre-eminent position in international politics . article # and # of the united nations charter grants the p # veto over amendments to the charter require them to approve stripping away their own veto powers . given the influence wielded by a veto-bearing state it is unlikely that any of the p # could agree to give up this privilege . <eos>

@highlight

<s> p- # countries will not allow the abolition of their un carolina veto <eos>
