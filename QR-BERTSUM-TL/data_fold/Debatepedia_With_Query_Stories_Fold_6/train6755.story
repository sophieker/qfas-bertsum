<s> consensus : is wikipedia 's model of disagreement a great one ? <eos>

<s> it makes a travesty of the revert rule when one individual can simply send an e-mail alert to friend requesting a timely `` revert favour '' once he has reached the limit of his daily reverts . this may apply to deletion debates as well where a groups of editors may be organized so as to always vote en masse in favour of keeping article written by one of the gang or related to the gang 's main field of interest . <eos>

@highlight

<s> editor form into `` gangs '' to impose their views on opposite minded contributors . <eos>
