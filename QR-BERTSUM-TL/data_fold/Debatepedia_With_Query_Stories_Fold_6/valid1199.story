<s> decision-making : is communism exceptional to other forms of government ? <eos>

<s> a truly socialist society would be far more versatile and flexible than any capitalist one . since there would be no classes and decisions would be made by the people they would be able to make decisions that would best avert the crisis for the average people not the elites ( like in capitalism or phony socialism ) . and since decision making would be truly democratic it would be easy to change things about the society if everyone decided it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> socialism can efficiently respond to crises . <eos>
