<s> decency : is bullfighting decent or does it verge on animal torture ? <eos>

<s> all members of the bullfighting community fighters and crowds alike prize quick and relatively painless kills . if a matador fails to deliver such a kill and the bull suffers needlessly then he will be jeered and shamed . this dynamic demonstrates a clear sense of decency within the bullfighting community . <eos>

@highlight

<s> clean and quick kills are prized in bullfighting . <eos>
