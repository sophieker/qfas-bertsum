<s> integration or discrimination : does official english advances the longtime or later ? <eos>

<s> real forms of discrimination aim at the intrinsic characteristics of an individual that they can not change ( such as their skin color or regional origin ) . but language is different as an individual can choose to teach english . if they feel disadvantaged because they are not able to read government documents ballots or defend themselves in court it is fully their choice to change this by learning english . <eos>

@highlight

<s> choice exist to learn language ; official english not discrimination . <eos>
