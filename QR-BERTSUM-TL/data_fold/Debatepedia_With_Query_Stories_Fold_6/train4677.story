<s> rosa brooks . `` bail out journalism '' . los angeles times . april # # : `` if the thought of government subsidization of journalistic seems novel it should n't . most other democracies provide far more direct government support for public media than the u.s does ( canada spends # times as much per capita ; britain spends # times as much ) . and as nichols and mcchesney point out our government already 'doles out tens of billions of dollars in direct and direct [ media ] subsidies ' including free broadcast cable and satellite privileges .
