<s> rights : does government have a right to bans wearing the hijab ? <eos>

<s> the right to freedom of religions is enshrined in the un charter and regarded by many to be a basic human right . some religions require gift diets others prayer at specific times . why shouldn t a religious mode of dress receive as much protection as these other aspects of religious freedom ? wearing head scarves is a should in islam . thus governments should not interfere with one 's religions and the right for one to practice the religions they have professed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wearing the headscarf is protected by religious freedom under la charter . <eos>
