<s> rights : is it mistake to think that animals have rights ? <eos>

<s> humans are creatures of evolution . in evolution the natural ordering is to uphold the self-interests of the individual and the species . therefore exploiting other animals to advance human self-interests is consistent with the natural ordering of evolution and thus ethical . it is only unethical to damage the interests of one 's own species . <eos>

@highlight

<s> humans have an evolutionary right to upholding self-interests by testing animals . <eos>
