<s> economics : what are the economics of carbon capturing and sequestration ? <eos>

<s> `` carbon capture research . '' department of energy : `` existing capture technologies however are not cost-effective when considered in the contexts of sequestering co # from power plants . most power plants and other large point sources use air-fired combustors a process that exhaust co # diluted with nitrogen . flue gas from coal-fired power plants contains # - # percent co # by volume while flue gas from natural gas combined cycle plants contains only # - # percent co # . for effective carbon sequester the co # in these exhaust gases must be separated and concentrated . the cost of co # capture use previous technologies however is on the order of $ # per ton of carbon - much too high for carbon emission reductions applications . analysis performed by sfa pacific inc. indicates <eos>
