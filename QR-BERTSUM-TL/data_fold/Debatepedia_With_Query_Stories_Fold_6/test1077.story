<s> special-ed : does nclb do much for third-grade children ? <eos>

<s> because no child left behind require that # % of students in a schools are able to pass disabled and third-grade students are often expected to pass the same exam as other students . because those of these students simply can not pass the same test disabled students are set up to fail and schools with disabled students are set up to fail as well . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no child right behind subjects disabled to same test standards . <eos>
