<s> enforcement : is is impossible to enforce anti-surrogacy laws ? <eos>

<s> even if there would be problems in enforcing a ban we should still lay down the law ; such an argument used against say growing cannabis at home would not invalidate a ban on drugs . insemination is bad for both the mother and the child and is beset by emotional problems for all concerned . parents should not put their own interests above their child s . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the difficulty of enforcing surrogacy laws does not justifying abandoning them . <eos>
