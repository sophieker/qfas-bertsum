<s> controversies : are there enough controversial calls to justify replay ? <eos>

<s> bad calls are typically the reason for fights or shouting matches breaking out between coaches and umpires . instant replay would reduce the occurrence of these events making it much harder for a coach to complain about a call . if instant replay confirms that it is accurate what can the coach complain about ? <eos>
