<s> choice : do voucher introduce beneficial choice to education ? <eos>

<s> voucher do not provide all private school students with a choice to attend private schools . private schools can inherently deny applicants entry . the main problem with this is that many of the most needy disadvantaged groups are already being turned away by private schools so education voucher may not provide them with any greater choice or access to private schools . private schools are closed to all students and this is why the disadvantaged should be helped through the private school system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor sometimes ca n't pay private schools even with voucher <eos>
