<s> parenting : can homosexuals do a great job of parenting ? <eos>

<s> gay couples currently have the right to raise child and they are exercising that right . so first to claim that denying them marriage is somehow protecting child is counter to the de facto reality . second those heterosexual couples that choose to raise child but who are denying marriage are denying the benefit to child-rearing that marriage offers . this is unfair to the child of heterosexual couples as but as to gay couples . <eos>

@highlight

<s> homosexuals raise children now but at a disadvantages without marriage <eos>
