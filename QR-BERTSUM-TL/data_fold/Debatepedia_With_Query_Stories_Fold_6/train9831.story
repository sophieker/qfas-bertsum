<s> commercial : is surrogacy likely to be commercialized ? is this exploitative ? <eos>

<s> the argument that surrogacy is exploitative rests primarily on the economic conditions of a woman that might cause her to `` involuntarily '' offer her body in surrogacy in exchange for money . yet this does not mean that surrogacy is inherently exploitative and is not sufficient grounds for banning the practice . measures need only be taken that will help minimize instances of exploitation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> surrogacy is not inherently exploitative ; exploitation can be minimized <eos>
