<s> israel : is israel 's policy of `` targeted assassination '' justified ? <eos>

<s> if the palestinian authority was taking strong action to fight terrorism it would be less legitimate for israel to assassinate palestinian leaders . but often palestinian leaders have done nothing or even supported palestinian terrorists . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the pa does little to fight terrorism ; it deserves no protections from assassinations <eos>
