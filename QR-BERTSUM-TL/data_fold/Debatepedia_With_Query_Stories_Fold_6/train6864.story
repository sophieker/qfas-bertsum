<s> health : is a vegetarian diet healthier for humans ? <eos>

<s> vegetarians are generally more health-conscious . this is the primary reason why they are healthy ; it is less a cause of vegetarians avoiding meat . similarly obese people are obese because they are not health-conscious more than because they are meat-eaters . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vegetarians are healthy due to their health-consciousness not vegetarianism . <eos>
