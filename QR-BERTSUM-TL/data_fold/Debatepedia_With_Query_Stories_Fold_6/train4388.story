<s> gender : do beauty pageants violates sexuality boundaries ? <eos>

<s> some complain that beauty pageant are exclusive to women but there are plenty of other sports that are exclusive to another sex or another such as american soccer or female field hockey . none of this means that any discrimination is occurring . rather it just means that another alternative option exists among a myriad of other options for each sex . sufficient options for additional curricular activities exist that neither complain that there is any kind of discrimination or unfairness going on . <eos>

@highlight

<s> plenty of other activity are exclusively to boys/girls . <eos>
