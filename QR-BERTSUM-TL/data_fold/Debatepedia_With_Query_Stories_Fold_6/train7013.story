<s> `` israel must withdraw from gaza '' . guardian . january 4 2009 : `` while hamas 's offensive capacities will be blunted for a while the likelihood as with hezbollah after lebanon in 2006 is that it will quickly rebuild its military strength . indeed the assassinations of its leaders by israel over the years - and the raids on its weapons workshops - did little to limit its rise to power . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> hamas will easily rebuild from damage inflicted by israel <eos>
