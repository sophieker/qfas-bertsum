<s> who would benefits from televised war ? who would not ? <eos>

<s> donation centers like `` good will '' and `` red cross '' would be able to make effective advertisements by relating to the war footage . this would boost donations and the army would benefit from showing the footage because they would receive donations . also the family and friends of soldiers would be able to see their loved ones as was mentioned earlier . the soldiers would know that their loved ones know that they are doing well and that they will not worry as much about them each night . <eos>

@highlight

<s> broadcast wars would allow donation centers to use filmed in commercials . <eos>
