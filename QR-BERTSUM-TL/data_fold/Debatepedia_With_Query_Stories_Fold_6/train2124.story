<s> parental responsibility : are parents primarily responsible for sex education ? <eos>

<s> the obvious problem with relying on parents to teach children essential sexual information is that many children do not have parents or responsible ones . should these children just go without such information ? the reason the answer must be no is that it would put such children at much greater risk of pregnancy or contracting stds . in a compassionate equal-opportunity society sex education in schools is required . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many teens do n't have ( responsible ) parents ; schools must teach sex-ed . <eos>
