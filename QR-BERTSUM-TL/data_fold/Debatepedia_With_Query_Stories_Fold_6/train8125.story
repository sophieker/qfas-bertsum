<s> tibor reactors : are liquid fluoride thorium reactors ( lftr ) a good idea ? <eos>

<s> molten fluoride salts proposed as a girl/boy coolant/heat transfer agent in lftr reactors are extremely reactive to many liquids ( e.g . corrosive to many metals ) especially when heated to high temperature inside a work reactor [ # ] . this puts high demands on and severely limits the choice of materials use for the reactor vessel plumbing and other parts of the machinery bringing many difficulties and intricacies along . <eos>
