<s> japanese whaling : could a cull avoid undermining the case against japanese whaling ? <eos>

<s> japan and other whalers are typically killing a scarce population of whales that has only recently emerged from the threatened species status . the killing of whales is for `` scientific purposes '' and for their meat . the problem is first that whales are scarce worldwide making each additional death of these animals marginally worse than the death of a kangaroo that is culled because of overpopulation . second there is a difference between opting to kill whales for `` scientific purposes '' and for commercial sales of their meat and being forced to kill kangaroo because they are overpopulating a country . this is why australian agriculture minister tony burke calls these `` different circumstances . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> kangaroo culling to fight overpopulation can not be compared with whaling <eos>
