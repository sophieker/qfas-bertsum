<s> undemocratic ? is the electoral college undemocratic ? <eos>

<s> - in a predominantly democratic state such as new york there is little doubt that a democratic nominee will win a majority vote and ensure that all # of the state 's electoral votes will go to the democratic nominee . this means that the minority republican population in new york has not electoral voice and is therefore in effect disenfranchised . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the electoral college disenfranchises minority party voters . <eos>
