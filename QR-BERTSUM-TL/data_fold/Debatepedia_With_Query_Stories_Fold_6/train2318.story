<s> consumer safety : are gm foods safe/healthy for consumers ? <eos>

<s> many anti-gmo advocates maintain that anything artificial or involving human tampering is morally bad . obviously only the most extreme misanthropes could believe that anything affected or produced by human tampering could somehow be evil . conventional foods have always been produced and refined with such tampering . this moral argument against human tampering in gmos therefore must be dismissed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the anti-gmo principle that genetic tampering is bad is erroneous <eos>
