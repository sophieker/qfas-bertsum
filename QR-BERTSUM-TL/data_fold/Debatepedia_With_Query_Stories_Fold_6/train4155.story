<s> school choice : does k-12 offer better choices of schools to students and parents ? <eos>

<s> when students and parents have the choices to leave bad schools they will often choose to do so . this will lower the talent pools in bad schools making them into simply the backwaters for under-performing and mischievous students which will further undermine these schools and students performances in a vicious cycle . <eos>

@highlight

<s> school choice in nclb will make bad school worse . <eos>
