<s> equality : can earmark be distributed equally ? <eos>

<s> there is no reason why earmarks must benefit all citizens equally even if they do approximately achieve this objectives in the long-run . some citizens and communities have greater needs than others even - sometimes - in the long-run . it would not be intrinsically unjust for a community that suffers from coastal erosion and flooding for example to receive more earmarked dollar than another community in the long-run . <eos>

@highlight

<s> earmarks need not benefits all similarly to be justified . <eos>
