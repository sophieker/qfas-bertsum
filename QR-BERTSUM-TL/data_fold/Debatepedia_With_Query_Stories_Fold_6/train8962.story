<s> military targets : were hiroshima and nagasaki legitimate military targets ? <eos>

<s> no one can deny that hiroshima and nagasaki were key industrial areas produced warships and other kinds of `` war materials '' and commanded southern japan . however the americans chose the wrong area - the area that had lots of innocent civilians . either they missed the target or they were so merciless that they wanted to kill civilians instead of military personnel in order to make the emperor stunned . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hiroshima and nagasaki were bad targets . <eos>
