<s> ethics : is it morally right to using atomic bombs ? <eos>

<s> supporters of the bombings have argued that the japanese governments waged total war ordering many civilians ( including women and children ) to work in factory and military offices and to fight against any invading force . father john a. siemes professor of modern philosophy at tokyo 's catholic university and an eyewitness to the atomic bomb attack on hiroshima wrote : `` we have discussed among ourselves the ethics of the use of the bomb . some consider it in the same category as poison gas and were against its use on a civil population . them were of the view that in total war as carried on in japan there was no difference between civilians and soldiers and that the bomb itself was an effective force <eos>

<s> atomic bombs were a just response to japan 's average wars tactics <eos>
