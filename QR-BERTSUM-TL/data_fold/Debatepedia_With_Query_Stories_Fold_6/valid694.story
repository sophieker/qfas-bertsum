<s> in some situations notably where residents aliens are defendants in the united states pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in a plea bargain should result in the criminal being deported . because a state judge has no influence over immigrants decision by the federal government a residents aliens charged with a crime may take a plea bargain plead guilty and furthermore be deported by the federal government for committing a `` crime of moral turpitude . '' such unintended or unforeseen effects of either a plea bargain or conviction at trial are sometimes called the collateral consequences of criminal charges . <eos>
