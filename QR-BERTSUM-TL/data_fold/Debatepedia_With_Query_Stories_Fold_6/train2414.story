<s> redistribution : is means testing the most effectiveness way of redistributing wealth to the poor ? <eos>

<s> because there is inevitably a limited amount of money available for social spend it is best that it is targeted at those in most need . means testing does this by setting an income level ( or several levels in a banded system ) below which government benefits may be claimed . by contrast universal benefits are poorly targeted giving government money to many family who do need it ( e.g . by paying the university fees of the children of well-off professionals or by providing pensions jobless benefits or free medical care to those who could afford private pensions and insurances schemes ) . in this way the government has than to spend on those who truly need it and inequality is perpetuated . <eos>

@highlight

<s> meaning testing enables re-distribution of money to where it is most needed . <eos>
