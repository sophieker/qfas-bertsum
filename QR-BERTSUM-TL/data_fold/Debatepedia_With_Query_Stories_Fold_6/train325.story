<s> due dessert ? does plea bargaining in exchange for testimony violate the notion of due dessert ? <eos>

<s> they punish criminals for committing crimes- the criminal never had any right to the lesser sentence so it 's not unjust when they are prescribed a punishment fitting the crime they were originally going to be tried for . <eos>

@highlight

<s> judges are not punishing criminals or rejecting plea bargaining deals . <eos>
