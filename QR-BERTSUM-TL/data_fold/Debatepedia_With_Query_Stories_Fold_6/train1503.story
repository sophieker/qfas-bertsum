<s> voluntary : is a mandatory system best or would a voluntary one be better ? <eos>

<s> if consumers care about calorie counts they will demand them on menus eventually leading to businesses adopting calorie counts on their own out of necessity and desire for business . if consumers do n't care then legislation to put them on menus is going to be utterly worthless . why would consumers look at or care about something they never even asked for in the first place ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> marketplace can encourage restaurants to voluntarily list calories <eos>
