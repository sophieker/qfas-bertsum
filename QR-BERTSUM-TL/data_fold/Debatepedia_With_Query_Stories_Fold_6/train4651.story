<s> feasibility : is an eu defense force a feasible notion ? <eos>

<s> even if we assume that the massive costs of a standing military force can be borne by the eu and its members the key barriers to establishing a standing defence force are often political . creating a european defence force de novo would require us to decide on several thorny questions namely the command structure whether the role should be merely defensive or include peacekeeping the choice of equipment and supplier creating a common defence policy and choosing a language of communication . all of these questions involve political considerations or economic vested interests all of which are likely to result in ongoing wrangling that will yield a stillborn edf . <eos>

@highlight

<s> political barriers exist . <eos>
