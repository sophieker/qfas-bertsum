<s> feasibility : is providing web as a way feasible ? <eos>

<s> in the event that a right to the internet is explicitly to think a `` negative right '' that preventing governments from censoring online content or cutting individuals off from the internet then ensure the right to the internet is not resource intensive at all . in reason constraining government in this way is possibly to actually save the government and taxpayers money and resources . in terms it is clearly `` feasible '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> right to internet may only think right to avoid govt censorship . <eos>
