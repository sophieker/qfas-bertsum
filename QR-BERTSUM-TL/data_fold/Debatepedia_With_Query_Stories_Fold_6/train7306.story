<s> self-determination : do the natives have a right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> dr. lyubomir ivanov . `` the future of the falkland islands and its people '' . feb. # - `` the falklanders are a nation same like the scots the welsh or the english -- or the people of tokelau for that matter . moreover their right to self-determination has already been officially and formally recognized and guaranteed by the british government through the processes of enacting the # falklands constitution . this act of transfer of prerogatives from london to stanley entails that any future decisions regarding the sovereignty of the islands would be up to the falklanders alone to make and this is irreversible . once recognized/granted the self-determination can not be taken away .
