<s> public opinion : where does public opinion stand on this issue ? <eos>

<s> justice is justice and judicial process is judicial process . this is the case no matter where public opinion stands on an issue . if it is right to try a terrorist in civilian courts than this should be done irrespective of what the public thinks . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public opinion irrelevant to merits of civilian trial of terrorists . <eos>
