<s> robert creamer . `` three reasons why a strong public option is likely to be part of health insurance reform '' cnn post . august # # : `` most major health insurance markets are dominated by two or three companies so there is no real competition ing with respect to price . [ ... ] once everyone is required [ by mandates ] to buy insurance the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - or through subsidies or the imposition of fines . you can see why from an insurance company perspective this would be a great deal .
