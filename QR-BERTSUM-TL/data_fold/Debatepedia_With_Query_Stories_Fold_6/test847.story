<s> violence : does watching tv increase violence rates among children and teens ? <eos>

<s> such behavior is usually determined by social environment family peer pressure or other factors . many antisocial people even do not watch tv while others may claim it is responsible for their actions simply to avoid taking responsibility for themselves . psychologists claim that television does not have a simple direct stimulus-response effect on its audiences . this can be illustrated by the example of japan where tv movies are famous for extreme violence but the crime rate is low much lower than in many societies where tv viewing is relatively rare . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no direct link between mass media and antisocial behaviour : <eos>
