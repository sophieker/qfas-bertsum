<s> abuse : would a dna database avoid resulting in governments abuse ? <eos>

<s> sam west . `` keep my dna on file . '' bbc . november # # : `` i had my dna sampling they took a cheeks swab from me . i did n't really mind at the time . and i have no problem with them keeping my dna profile indefinitely . i would have thought that the only those worried about this happening are those who think that they may be likely to commit a crime in the future . i appreciate there is a case for `` innocent until proven guilty '' . but if you 're innocent - why worry ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> only murderers should worry about their genetic samples being on file . <eos>
