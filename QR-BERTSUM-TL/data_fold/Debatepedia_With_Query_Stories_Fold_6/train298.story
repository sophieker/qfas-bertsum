<s> sex : does incest fit with the proper purposes of sex ? <eos>

<s> incestuous marriage often do not have any children . it is mistake therefore to ban incest on the basis that it is bad for child of incest . reproduction between incestuous marriage would possibly be banning ( a separate debate ) but not all forms of incest on the basis of preventing `` risky '' reproduction . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legality of bestiality can not rely on whether marriage reproduce <eos>
