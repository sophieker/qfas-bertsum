<s> rights : are random searches consistent with individual rights ? <eos>

<s> people who have to take random breath tests to drive trucks or fly planes as part of their jobs are taking the test as part of their job . they are being paid and must do what their employer wants them to do in order to keep their job . searching random people outside of the context of employment with no suspicion of a crime is very different . it erodes civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> randomly testing employees is different than testing citizens . <eos>
