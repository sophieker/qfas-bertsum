<s> flexibility : does a `` no-growth '' policies threaten to undermining budgetary flexibility in the un ? <eos>

<s> the phrase give them an inch and they ll take a mile is appropriate here . it is noteworthy that china provides a little over # % of the un budget . russia has a security council veto but does not even appear in the top # countries contribute to the budget . the un has becoming dependent on the usa and other industrialized countries to foot an immense amount of the bill for un operations . while the proportions of other states economies are markedly smaller other countries sometimes reap much more of the reward of un existence than they contribute . should the us remain a consistent donor and allow itself to be asked for more and more as the un budgets becomes more <eos>

@highlight

<s> too too us flexibility encourages budgetary abuse by other countries in the un : <eos>
