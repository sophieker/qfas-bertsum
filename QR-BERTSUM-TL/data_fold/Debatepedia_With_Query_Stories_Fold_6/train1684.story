<s> uninsured : do large numbers of uninsured give cause to universal health care ? <eos>

<s> lawrence r. huntoon md phd . `` universal health coverage -- - call it socialized medicine '' . association of american physicians and surgeons . # . - `` collectively the uninsured pay about $ # . # billion in extra taxes each year because they do not receive the same tax break as insured people with similar income ... where we must ask is the compassion for these overtaxed hard-working people ? this is clearly a government-created problem . what we do n't need is more government ( nationalized health care ) to `` fix it . '' what we need is to get government out of our wallets so people can have their own money needed to purchase and own their own health insurance . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the uninsurance problem should be solved by less not more government <eos>
