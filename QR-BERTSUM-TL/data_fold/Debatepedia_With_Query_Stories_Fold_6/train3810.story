<s> politics : can judges function well or better in the political process ? <eos>

<s> while some complain elections would make the judiciary partisan in nature this seems to forget that the appointment of judges is partisan with the appointee typically carrying the banner of the appointers party . in other words with elections or appointments there is no getting away from some partisanship . <eos>

@highlight

<s> appointed judges are identified with the party of the appointer . <eos>
