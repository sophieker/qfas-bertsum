<s> government : is a fat tax justified in shaping social ends ? <eos>

<s> we can not know whether tomorrow a global calamity will change circumstances where only those with an extra 50-100lbs fat will have the reserves to survive . not that this or any one scenario is likely nor does it justifies an argument . the fact of our ignorance however does justify humility in dictating uniform behavior and virtue in allowing diversity of individual choices . likewise diversity of behavior provides to all object lessons on the consequences of each individuals choice be it beneficial or not . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the virtue of a free society is the diversity of individual behavior . <eos>
