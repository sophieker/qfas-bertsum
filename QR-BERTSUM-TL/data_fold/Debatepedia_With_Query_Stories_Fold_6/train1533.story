<s> npov : is wikipedia 's neutral point of view ( npov ) sound ? <eos>

<s> you might have to work with those who think the arctic opposite to you on a same topic and their opinion might win the days for reasons other than being correct . for example a monomaniac no matter how ignorant or even malicious may `` win out '' eventually because non-monomaniacs have other things to do than argue with them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there 's no ways to splitting irreconcilable povs <eos>
