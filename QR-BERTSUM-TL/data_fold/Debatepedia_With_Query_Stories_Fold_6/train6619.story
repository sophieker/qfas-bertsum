<s> independence : is a republic important to australian independence from britain ? <eos>

<s> republicans make the argument that the monarchy needs to be abolished in order to secure an australian head of state . this presumes that the queen is the non-australian head of state . but what about the governor-general ? the governor-general part of the monarchy is the head of state and a native australian ? so the monarchy system does provide an australian head-of-state . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the governor-general is an australian head of state <eos>
