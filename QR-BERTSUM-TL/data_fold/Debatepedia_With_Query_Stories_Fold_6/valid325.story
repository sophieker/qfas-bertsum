<s> illegitimacy : is the journalists not entitled to `` legitimate access '' to celebrities ? <eos>

<s> any celebraty use to being chased around and followed everywhere by the media and paparazzi would tell you that they do n't like or want that . the thought of the own safe zones is to protect celebraties from unwanted media . if the media wanted access to the person for a legitimate reason they could but have access to them . just that now the media ca n't get too close crowd around the person or block where they 're going for photography and filming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if celebreties wanted to be chased up by the paparazzi they would disapproved of the `` britney law . '' <eos>
