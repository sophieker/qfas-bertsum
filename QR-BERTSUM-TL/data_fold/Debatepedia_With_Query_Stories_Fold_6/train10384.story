<s> choice : do charter schools offer beneficial choices to parents/students ? <eos>

<s> larry kuehn . `` ten problems with charter schools '' . british columbia teachers ' federation . 1995 - `` the concerns of most parents can be addressed by the current system . many program options are currently offered in public schools and schools are increasingly open to program options . particular languages areas of focus such as the arts and special needs are already met by programs within the public schools . this approach better serves the public good than setting up what are often essentially private schools with full public funding . parent advisory committees mandated in the school act provide an opportunity for parents to provide input into the school policies .
