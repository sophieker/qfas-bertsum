<s> caused dessert ? does plea bargaining in exchange for testimony violate the notion of caused dessert ? <eos>

<s> they punished criminals for commit crimes- the crimes never had any right to the lesser sentences so it 's not unjust when they are prescribed a punishment fitting the crime they were previously go to be tried for . <eos>

@highlight

<s> judges are not punishing murderers or rejecting plead bargaining deals . <eos>
