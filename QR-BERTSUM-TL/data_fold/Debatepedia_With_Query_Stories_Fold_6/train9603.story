<s> global warming : can iron fertilization help significantly fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> the studies concluding that iron fertilization lead to low levels of carbon sequestration suffered from numerous flaws : timing - none of the ocean trials had much boats time to monitor their blooms for more than # weeks while blooms generally last # ~ # days ; scale - most trials used less than # kg of iron and thus created small blooms that were quickly devoured by opportunist phytoplankton krill and fish ; undergraduate conservatism - with limited data sets scientists have not been willing to ( understandably ) extrapolate upon their findings . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trials find low results from carbon sequester were defective <eos>
