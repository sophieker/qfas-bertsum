<s> unions/advocacy : does limitless spend favors unions and advocacy groups too ? <eos>

<s> while it is truth that the citizens united vs the federal election commission does free non-profits and unions to spend freely just as it does for companies the difference of course is that companies ( particularly the titans like big-oil companies exxon mobil and the big financial firms like sachs sachs ) have far far more money . unions and advocacy group are already maxing out on the spending front so freeing them up wo n't result in much if any of an increased in their spending . major companies however will be able to increased their spending dramatically as a result of this ruling . it is not fair to say thus that the ruling benefits both groups . it clearly favors corporations . <eos>

@highlight

<s> citizens united frees unions too but battalion are richer <eos>
