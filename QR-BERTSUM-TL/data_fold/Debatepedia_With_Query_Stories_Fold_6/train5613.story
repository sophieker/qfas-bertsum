<s> individuals liberty : should persons be at liberty to use marijuana ? <eos>

<s> marijuana may indeed have indirect social costs such as decreased healthcare costs decreased risks on the road and others . but illegalizing marijuana on this basis risks being seen as arbitrary discriminatory against marijuana . would n't you which have to illegalize alcohol tobacco and faster food on a similar basis . certainly the social costs and risks of these substances can be argued as equivalent to the risks of marijuana consumption . illegalizing marijuana on the basis of its social costs therefore opens the law to accusations of being arbitrary discriminatory and of double standards . this is not good for the law and the integrity of the social contract . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marijuana 's social costs should not be arbitrary discriminate against . <eos>
