<s> feasibility : is it possible to abolish the veto power ? <eos>

<s> the abolition of the power of veto is highly unlikely . the p5 states will not willingly cede their pre-eminent position in international politics . articles 108 and 109 of the united nations charter grants the p5 veto over amendments to the charter requiring them to approve stripping away their own veto powers . given the influence wielded by a veto-bearing state it is unlikely that any of the p5 would agree to give up this privilege . <eos>

@highlight

<s> p-5 countries will not allow the abolition of their un sc vetoes <eos>
