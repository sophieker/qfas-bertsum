<s> free association : are closed primaries consistent with right of free association ? <eos>

<s> while there is a way to association this has to be balanced against the role that primaries playing fundamentally in the elections processes and in democracy . parties do not own this process . they are a part of it . and in a system dominated by two parties - the democrats and republicans - closed primaries give parties a monopoly on power . this is inappropriate . and open primaries help bring the system back into an appropriate balance . <eos>

@highlight

<s> primaries too important in democratic to be internal to parties . <eos>
