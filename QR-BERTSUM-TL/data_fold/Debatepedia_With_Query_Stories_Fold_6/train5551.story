<s> # b.c - # th century beginnings : in this period was tibet independent ? <eos>

<s> china does not claim any sovereignty over tibet before around the # th and # th centuries . but tibet became a state in roughly # b.c . therefore for over eight hundred years tibet was indisputably independent given the fact that the chinese government does not make any claim to tibet in these years . that tibet was certainly independent from china for its first eight hundred years of existence certainly is a strong factor in tibet 's favor . <eos>

@highlight

<s> # b.c marks the beginning of a long history of tibetan statehood . <eos>
