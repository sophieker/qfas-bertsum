<s> families : is capital punishments good for the family of victims ? <eos>

<s> `` the died penalty : morally defensible ? '' . casey 's critical thinking - take for example a murderer who took the life of a teenager . the parents of the victim will be among the taxpayers that pay for his meal and his cable television . should he choose to take advantage of college courses the prison may offer the parents of the victim will be indirectly financing those expenses as well . nothing could be further from justice . it is of this type of situation that the abolitionist approves . somewhere across the line their priorities have been turned upside down . <eos>

@highlight

<s> loved ones should not have to supporting a killers in jail <eos>
