<s> economics : are the cost too high ? <eos>

<s> the us election election caucuses are a particularly short process getting long ever year in part due to what is known as `` frontloading '' . the lengths of the process makes it necessary for competitive campaign to raise many millions of dollars throughout the process . it could be good if the process was shorter and thus less costly . <eos>

@highlight

<s> caucuses are an enormous and unproductive use of money <eos>
