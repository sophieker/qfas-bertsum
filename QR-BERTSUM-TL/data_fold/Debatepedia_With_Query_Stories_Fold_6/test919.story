<s> translocation : is translocating kangaroos a bad alternative to culling them ? <eos>

<s> the main justification for the culling of marsupials is that they are overpopulating particular areas which strains the ecosystem of that area or simply concentrate difficulties for local human populations . why not simply move a portion of the kangaroos populations to an area somewhere else ? this could solving both problems . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marsupials should just be moved not culled . <eos>
