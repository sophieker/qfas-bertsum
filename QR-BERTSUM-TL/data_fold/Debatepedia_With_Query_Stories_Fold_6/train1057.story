<s> emergency : is abortion justified in ordering to saving the life of a mother ? <eos>

<s> most abortion are performed entirely voluntarily by women that have the means to raise a children but simply do n't need to . while emergency abortion or abortion under trying circumstances such as rape are held out as reasons to continue to have abortion they are infrequent and serve more to provide cover for voluntarily `` life-style '' abortions . this is wrong . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortions under `` trying circumstances '' are the exception not the rule <eos>
