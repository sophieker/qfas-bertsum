<s> nearly all countries produce nuclear waste . no matter what therefore the world must find a way to deal with it . if underground storage is the best way then the world has no choice but to adopt the practice . a november # eu nuclear commissions report : `` all eu member states generate radioactive wastes whether or not they have a regional nuclear power program and therefore have to identify solutions and define regional requirements to manage it properly . '' [ # ] <eos>
