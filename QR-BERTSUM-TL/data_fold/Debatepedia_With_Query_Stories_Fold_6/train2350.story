<s> crime : are locker-search important in fighting student crime ? <eos>

<s> it is obvious that if students are faced with the prospect of locker searches they will just find another hiding place or keep things on their person . the thrust of policy should not be about finding things once they are in school it should be about stopping them getting there in the first place . metal detectors for example are fair because they check everyone ( rather than singling people out ) without intruding on them . students who are singled out for searches are effectively and publicly accused of a crime . occasionally something incriminating may be found ; almost always it wo n't be but any bond of trust between school/teacher and student will be broken and disaffection is likely to follow . <eos>

@highlight

<s> medal detectors are a better approach than locker searches . <eos>
