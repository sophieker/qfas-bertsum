<s> morality : is child labor immoral ? would the ban ameliorate the moral issue ? <eos>

<s> `` it is also argued that child labour in poor countries imposes emotional costs on rich-country consumers who find this offensive and is thus another cross-border side-effect . if so the rich would do better to send the children aid rather than impose harmful trade sanctions . '' [ `` the standard question '' the economist january 2000 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> ban on exports is harmful . <eos>
