<s> democracy : is seating the delegates required in preserving democracy ? <eos>

<s> certainly the florida and ohio democratic parties are responsible for breaking the rules of the democratic national committee by attempting to move their state primary forward in the calendar . punishing them is an appropriate measure . but it is unfair and undemocratic to unseat the delegates of these states as the chief recipient of this punishment are actually the ohio and florida democratic voters who are subsequently disenfranchised . voters should not be punish for the mistakes of their leaders . rather punishments should focus on penalizing the state democratic parties and their leaders . this would be a more just punishment and more democratic . in the # elections the best response would be to allow the voters to have their voices herd by <eos>

@highlight

<s> punishing the flor . and mich. democracy state parties should not which punished voters . <eos>
