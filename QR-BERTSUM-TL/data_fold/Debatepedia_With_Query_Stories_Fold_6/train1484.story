<s> international law : can assassinations of tyrants be justified in international law ? <eos>

<s> tyranny and oppression are obvious wherever they take place . it isn t just how democratic a regime is it is whether it uses its power to inflict great suffering upon its people or others against all human rights standards . if leaders guilty of genocide or other crimes against humanity can be brought to account through the normal democratic process or the courts then fine . but if they can not then their people have the moral right to take up arms against them . sometimes this will mean assassination . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if tyrants ca n't be brought to justice assassination is a good idea . <eos>
