<s> public opinion : where does the public stand on this option ? <eos>

<s> appeal to the majority is nothing more than tyranny of the majority and means absolutely nothing to whether a public insurance option is worth it or will even help . just in case you do n't believe this ask yourself this ... if 51 % of the public thought slavery was good would you use that as an argument for a change in equal rights ' laws ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> following majority support for public option is tyranny of majority . <eos>
