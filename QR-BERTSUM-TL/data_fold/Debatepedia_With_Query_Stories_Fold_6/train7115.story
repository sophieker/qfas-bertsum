<s> hybrids may have a `` power '' and performance advantage over electric cars ( although this is debatable ) . if we assume that they do though is this something that should be seen as significant ? no . the moral priority at this time is to fighting global warming not uphold the flamboyant unecessary and but more wasteful bang-for-buck of investigation-based vehicles . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the `` performance '' of hybrid is irrelevant to global warming . <eos>
