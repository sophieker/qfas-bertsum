<s> narcotic ? can coca be classified as a narcotic ? <eos>

<s> the active ingredient in coca leaf is the same as in cocaine . it 's just more concentrated in cocaine . because the raw material of coca and its more potent relative cocaine are so closely aligned it is impossible to disassociate the two . if one hopes to consider cocaine a narcotic and stop its spread they must also forbid coca . <eos>

@highlight

<s> coca can not be disassociated with cocaine . <eos>
