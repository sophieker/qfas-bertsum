<s> practicality : are biofuels practical to use ? <eos>

<s> those looking to replace gasoline with ethanol in their car must have a flex-fuel model that can run on either fuel . given that ethanol is one of the main biofuels being proposed and promoted by many governments most cars using the fuel would have to be pre-designed as `` flex-fuel '' cars in order to use the corn ethanol biofuel . this means that massive amounts of money would have to be invested in constructing these `` flex-cars '' . these vehicles would not be readily available nor would gas stations that are capable of accommodating them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> only special `` flex-cars '' can use corn ethanol . <eos>
