<s> fiscal burdens : would the creation of a dna database be a major fiscal burden ? <eos>

<s> the requisite computer and laboratory technology is already available . the united states has developed the combined dna index system ( codis ) .the expense of sampled the entire populations of most nations would be substantial . it is likely to be offset by any subsequent saving in police resources . yet the issue is properly the prices that we should put on justice . the electoral rhetorical of law and order suggests that the public puts a very high premium on protection from crime .

@highlight

<s> the created of a dna databases would not require a disproportionate investments of time or public resources . <eos>
