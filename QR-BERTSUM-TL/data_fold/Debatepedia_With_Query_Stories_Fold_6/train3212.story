<s> debt : do developed states have a responsibility to increase aid ? <eos>

<s> climate change is hard to predict and it is worth noting that it may benefit some poor countries where it might make the climate more suitable for more lucrative crop production . while it certainly may hurt many or even most other poor countries the fact that it could benefit a number of poor countries runs against the idea that climate aid should be increased to all poor countries for the purpose of adaptation . and it undermines the idea that all developed countries will owe all poor countries a debt over climate change . <eos>

<s> climate change may benefit many poor countries . <eos>
