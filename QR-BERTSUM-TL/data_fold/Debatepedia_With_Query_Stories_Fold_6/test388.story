<s> is turkey get to joining the eu ? <eos>

<s> on # april # turkey submitted an applications for membership to the european communities ( ec ) . it took the european commission until december # to produce an opinion approved by the european council two months later refusing accession negotiations on several grounds . it was pointed out that the communities itself was undergone major changes following the adoption of the single act ; it would therefore be improper to become involved in new accession negotiations at this stage . furthermore the economic and politics situation in turkey including the negative consequences of the dispute between turkey and one member state of the communities and also the situation in cyprus led the commission to think that it would not be useful to open accession negotiations <eos>

@highlight

<s> turkey s eligibility for members has been reconfirmed on many occasion <eos>
