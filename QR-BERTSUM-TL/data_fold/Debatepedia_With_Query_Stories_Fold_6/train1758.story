<s> nuclear weapons : does thorium reduce the risk of bomb-making ? <eos>

<s> while it is possible to build a bomb from u # the fissile isotope in a thorium reactor it 's not very easy to do . this is because the gamma radiation is much higher than with u # making material handling much more challenging . there is less chance therefore of weapons diversion . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> making nuclear bombs with thorium is harder than with uranium . <eos>
