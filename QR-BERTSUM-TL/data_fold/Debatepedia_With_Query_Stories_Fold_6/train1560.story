<s> clone : is cloning fair to cloned humans ? <eos>

<s> nick bostrom faculty of philosophy at oxford university . `` human reproductive cloning from the perspective of the future '' . december # th # - `` such an imaginary point-of-view can help us put things in perspective . there is one argument that as a future clone you might understand and agree with : concerns about the safety of the procedure . the argument that we ought to postpone human cloning until we have perfected the method in animals makes some degree of sense . ( even so suppose you were a slightly deformed human clone - would you agree that it was a terrible moral offense to have caused you to come into existence ? ) '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> deformed clones would still be happy to be alive <eos>
