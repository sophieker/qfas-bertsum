<s> voters : can voters and elections do a good job at electing judges ? <eos>

<s> jason kleinman . `` so should we elect our judges or is there a better way ? '' why it 's our city . june 15th 2009 : `` here s what electing judges does . it forces them to beg campaign cash from the very people who would appear before them in court . it forces voters to choose from clogged slates of unknown names . not surprisingly those voters fall back on dumb factors such as ballot position ethnic surnames and who bought the most tv ads . judicial elections have become costly showdowns between corporate and union lobbies with clueless voters in the crossfire . '' <eos>

<s> election of judges delegitimizes their role <eos>
