<s> school : is it appropriate to bans heads scarves in public schools ? <eos>

<s> it is potentially divisive in the classroom marking some children out as different from the others and above the rules that the school enforce for everyone else . this may lead to alienation and bullying . complete headscarves may also be impractical or dangerous in some lessons for instance pe swimming or in technology and science lessons where machinery is being operated . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the hijab causes problem in school such as division and alienation . <eos>
