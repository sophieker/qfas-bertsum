<s> health : can drinking be healthy ? does this apply to young adults ? <eos>

<s> people who start drinking before they are old enough become socialised into a heavy drinking culture at an impressionable age and partly because of the state of their physical development . there is also evidence from the us center for disease control that underage drinkers have higher suicide and homicide rates . when drunk young people may do things which cause longer term problems such as having unprotected sex . uk studies show that a third of those who lose their virginity before the age of 15 do so under the influence of alcohol . we should protect young people from these harms by maintaining a high age limit . <eos>

@highlight

<s> teenagers who start drinking too early have a 1500 % more chance of becoming alcoholics and drinking too much . <eos>
