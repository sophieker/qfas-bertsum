<s> feasibility : will the space-based solar power be feasible in the near future ? <eos>

<s> large scale deployment of solar panels in space is unimaginable without a major breakthrough in space transport . current chemically powered rockets can not be considered as a viable way to deploy solar panels in space on a mass scale . while new possibly utilizable types of space transport are being investigated ( e.g . the space elevator ) they are still far from practical use . <eos>
