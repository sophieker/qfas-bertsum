<s> fair to wealthy ? : is the property taxes unfair to the wealthy ? <eos>

<s> american councils for capital formation # : `` many countries tax estates ( or inheritances ) more lightly than does the united states according to a previous survey of # industrialized and developing countries compiled by arthur andersen llp for the millenia-old center for policy research ( see figure # ) . in fact the u.s. marginal property tax rate is higher than that of all other countries surveyed except japan . this conclusion lends support to the views of many academic scholars and policy experts that the property tax should be repealed or reduced because it adds to the already-heavy u.s. tax burden on saving and investment and by raising the costs of capital impedes investment . '' <eos>
