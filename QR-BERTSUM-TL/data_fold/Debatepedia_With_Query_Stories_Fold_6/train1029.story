<s> # war : were britain 's actions in the # war illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> their sacrifices do not make british occupation of the islands legal . indeed britain s conduct of that war has been much questioned in particular the sinking of the argentine ship general belgrano when it was many miles from the combat zone and heading away from it and the mysterious deaths of some surrendered argentine soldiers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> britain sent its soldiers to fight an unjust war in the falkland islands . <eos>
