<s> cheating : does the use of cell phone in school worsen cheating ? <eos>

<s> by giving students an access toward cellphones the ratio of students for doing communication within school hour are far more greater than ever before . they will more likely opening google in time of examination to find answers . they rather sending text full of answer in the corner of the class than just waiting for answer . students are a lot more creative these day so thus by not allowing cellphone to be carried away in school it will reduce the chance of spoilers and cheating methods to take place . <eos>
