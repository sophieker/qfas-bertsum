<s> broad strategy : is a continuation of the war in iraq regard to us/coalition interests ? <eos>

<s> invaded iraq was - at least with nods and winks - secure us and coalition oil interests in a country with the second to third largest oil reserves in the world . it although has not done so and has resulted in the greatest oil-price hike in decades . for sure this justification for invaded was faulty . it be also be true that withdrawing would help re- stabilizing global oil prices . this is based in large whole on combination of cases that withdrawing from iraq will not cause greater chaos and that it be actually improve the situation ( below ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the iraq war has decreased oils producing in iraq rather than securing it <eos>
