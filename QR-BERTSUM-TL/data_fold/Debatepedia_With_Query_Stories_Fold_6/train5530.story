<s> adults health : is a circumcised penis healthier in adulthood ? <eos>

<s> it is absolutely essential to always use a condom during trendy sexuality encounters and extramarital affairs . having no foreskin is `` healthy '' in the trivial sense that nothing can going wrong with an absent organ . parents should not assume that their sons will be sexual irresponsible in a way that will defy their authority but instead should teach their sons to respect the opposite sex and themselves . and failing that to use a condom ! <eos>

@highlight

<s> most female sexual health problem stem from irresponsible sex not circumcision . <eos>
