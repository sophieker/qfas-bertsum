<s> economics : will the lisbon treaty be economically beneficial ? <eos>

<s> `` the case for a no vote . foreign investment in ireland . '' lisbon treaty information campaign - `` lisbon may also be used to limit ireland 's right to encourage foreign direct investment - in other words to prevent us wooing foreign companies here with promises of state aid . given that a significant number of irish people are employed by such companies giving this power to the eu is a dangerous step for ireland . our country should never have allowed our country to come under the control of the common commercial policy under lisbon . the truth is unless lisbon is defeated we are in danger of losing control over our economy .
