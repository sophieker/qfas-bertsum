<s> religious arguments - what are the pro and con religious and religious-text-based arguments on partial birth abortions ? <eos>

<s> that a fetus only becomes a person after its head has emerged . because partial birth abortions involves the killing of the fetus before its head is removed from the womb many jews believe it is justified under certain circumstances as the fetus is not yet a `` person '' or `` citizen '' . however many jews believe that partial birth abortion is only justified in exceptional cases in which it protects the mother .
