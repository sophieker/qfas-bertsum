<s> property : is the communist perspective on collective ownership of property appropriate ? <eos>

<s> whatever rhetoric may be used the fact of ownership of property is having control over the use and disposition of said property . when one speaks of `` collective '' ownership one is really speaking of government ownership . as a practical matter then the representatives of the state then grant usage of property to individuals who then effectively own it . the real question is whether individuals will gain the use of property through the exchange of their own productive labor or if they will gain its use through political influence . communism is simply a newer atheistic form of feudalism with divine right of kings replaced with political right of the commissars . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` collective '' ownership is an ill defined concept <eos>
