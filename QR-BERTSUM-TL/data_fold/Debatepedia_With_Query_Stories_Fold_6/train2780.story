<s> other symbols : is bans other religious symbols important along-side a head scarves ban ? <eos>

<s> while some defend a ban on muslims head scarves by pointed to bans on other religious symbols there are important differences between these symbols . the head scarf performs an actual physical function ( protecting the dignity of a woman ) . crosses and anti-cyclic do not perform such physical functions . by depriving a woman of a head scarf you are not merely depriving them of their symbol but also forcing them to go without a functional religious tool . <eos>

@highlight

<s> bans head scarves is worse than bans other religious symbols . <eos>
