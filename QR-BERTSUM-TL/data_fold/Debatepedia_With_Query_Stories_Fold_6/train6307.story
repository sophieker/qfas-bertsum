<s> national security : is an `` open '' policy to foreign student great for national security ? <eos>

<s> - it is well documented that terrorist have successfully exploit overseas student visas programs . a number of # / # terrorist did so . this is a significant concern for countries and instituting controls to counter this threat is a natural response . if this limits some students from entering a overseas study programs this is an appropriate costs for taking measures that could save the lives of thousands of people . it should be kept in mind that the victim of a terrorist attack is deprived of life and all their freedoms and rights while a overseas student that does not get into a overseas programs due to security measures is deprived of only a limited range of opportunities ; the trade-off is acceptable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> having controls for admitted foreign student is not anti-foreigner <eos>
