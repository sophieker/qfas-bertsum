<s> religion : does homosexuality checking out on religion grounds ? <eos>

<s> the economist `` the cases for gay marriage '' # / # / # - `` it is no businesses of the state to impose a religious choice . surely in america the constitutional expressly bans the involvement of the state in religious matters so it would be especially outrageous if the constitutional were now to be used for religious ends [ that aim to ban gay marriage ] . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> biblical passages that are claimed to condemn homosexuality are being misinterpreted . <eos>
