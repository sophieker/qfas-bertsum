<s> efficacy : will a bailout help solve the problem ? <eos>

<s> felix salmon . `` why the greek bailout won t work . '' reuters . may 3 2010 : `` the fact is that the bailout package really doesn t address the problem which is one of solvency rather than liquidity . the european loans are being extended at about 5 % which while much lower than market rates is still not low enough to make anything approaching a dent in greece s debt dynamics . and by the time the bailout package is exhausted if greece even gets that far its debt-to-gdp ratio will be significantly higher than it is right now thanks to both a rising numerator and a declining denominator .
