<s> risks : what are the risk involved ? <eos>

<s> the environmental effects of oceanic storage are generally negative and poorly understood . large concentrations of co # kills ocean organisms but one problem is that dissolved co # would eventually equilibrate with the atmosphere so the storage would not be permanent . also as part of the co # reacts with the waters to form carbonic acid h # co # the acidity of the ocean waters increases . the resulting environmental effects on benthic life forms of the bathypelagic abyssopelagic and hadopelagic zones are poorly understood . even though life appears to be rather dense in the deep ocean basins energy and chemical effects in these deep basins would have far reaching implications . much more working is needed here to define the extent of the potential problems . <eos>

<s> ocean sequestration of carbon has positive effects . <eos>
