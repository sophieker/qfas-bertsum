<s> irony : are develop states more obligated because poorer states are harmed most ? <eos>

<s> developed countries were not even concerned of the consequences of their emissions through most of the industrial revolution . therefore they were certainly not concerned that the consequences would disproportionately fall on poor developing nations . developed countries are not therefore responsible or culpable for these disproportionate consequences so they should not be disproportionately obligated to fight globally climate change on this point . <eos>

@highlight

<s> developed did not plans for emissions to harm poor most . <eos>
