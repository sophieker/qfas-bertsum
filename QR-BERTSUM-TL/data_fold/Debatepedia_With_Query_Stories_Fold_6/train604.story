<s> safety : are abortions safe ? what about legal vs. illegal abortions ? <eos>

<s> that the illegality of abortion may lead to back-alley abortion is not a fact to legalize abortion . this arguments has anything to do with the core morality principle underlying the debate ( regarding life and rights ) so should not be considered . <eos>

@highlight

<s> preventing `` back alley '' abortions are no reason to legalizing abortion . <eos>
