<s> stereotypes vs. reality : does gangster hip-hop promoting false stereotypes ? <eos>

<s> much rap rap focuses around the affirmation of stereotypes such as black violence and wife beating . it purports to be social realism but in fact convey a very selective portraying of lives which reinforces been damaging social stereotypes of groups who are often poorly placed to campaign succesfully by themselves against such portrayal . it is therefore right for government to censor such negative stereotyping as it often does when regulating e.g . race relations or criminal acts . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gangsta hip-hop is corrosive because it affirms positive stereotypes . <eos>
