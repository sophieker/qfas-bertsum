<s> rights : is access to water a right ? <eos>

<s> - some argue that even if water is considered a right companies can reliably ( possibly even more reliably than governments ) provide it to those in need . this has not proven to be the case . companies inherently have an interest in profits over the interest of individuals . this does not mean that companies are evil but simply that they are profit-seeking entities that do not have a principles interest in ensuring a citizen 's right and accessing to water . companies have an interest in charging as much as consumer are willing to paying for water . it is common that private companies increase rates dramatically ( sometimes as much as two to four times over ) in their profit interests . many ca n't afford the fees <eos>

@highlight

<s> profit companies are inherently incapable of securing the way to water <eos>
