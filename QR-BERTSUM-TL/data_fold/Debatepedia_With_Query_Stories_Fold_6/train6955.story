<s> nyc councilman michael bloomberg said in an august # speech in defense of the ground zero mosque : `` in the mid- # s the small jewish community living in lower manhattan petitioned dutch governor john stuyvesant for the way to build a synagogue and they were turned down . in # when stuyvesant also prohibited quakers from holding meetings a group of non-quakers in queen signed the flushing remonstrance a petition in defense of the way of quakers and others to freely practice their religion . it was perhaps the first formal politics petition for religious freedom in the american colonies and the organizer was thrown in jail and then banished from new amsterdam . 'in the # s even as religious freedom took hold in america <eos>
