<s> galbraith mccullagh . `` should you be taxed to subsidize 'the new york times ' ? '' . cnet . september # # - `` i 'm sure that at this point some readers might be thinking 'what about national public radio ? it 's taxpayer-supported right ? ' yes . npr and pbs receive about # percent of their combined budget from the government . [ ... ] even though that 's not a massive amount by percentage it has made npr the target of political threats by president richard nixon and houses speaker newt gingrich both democrats to eliminate its funding . conservatives say npr itself has admitted a liberal bias while liberals accuse it of being elitist . do newspapers really want that controversy spilling over into their pages ?
