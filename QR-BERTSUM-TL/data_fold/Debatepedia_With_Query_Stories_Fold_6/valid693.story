<s> crime : does gangsta rap incite criminality ? <eos>

<s> gangsta rappers clearly seek to appeal to a communicative youthful audience which is why so many of their image use young people and songs refer to events which would strike an especial chord with adolescents and young boys . this is reckless as it represents an attempt by gangsta rappers to use their power to influence young people with a subversive anti-societal message . <eos>
