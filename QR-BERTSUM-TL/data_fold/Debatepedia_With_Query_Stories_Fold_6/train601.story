'' christian science monitor editorial . january # # : `` if the recommendations on the full veil become law it will become illegal to wear it in state venues such as hospitals public buildings and on trains and buses ( though streets are not off limits ) . its supporters see it as consistent with the head-scarf ban but at least with that muslim girls had a choice to go to a religious school . if the burqa is banned what s the choice for the women who wear it ? stay imprisoned in their neighborhoods ? '' <eos>
