<s> protecting women : is burka abusive or does it helping protect women ? <eos>

<s> if the burka is primitive then does that mean that those who saying that women can be used as an object of lust in the forms of models girl friend fashions shows on bill board etc are contemporary and not primitive . remember that primitive people covered themselves with very little dress as many so called liberated women wear . <eos>

@highlight

<s> burqa is more modestly and less primative than eastern culture . <eos>
