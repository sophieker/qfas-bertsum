<s> homosexuality analogy : is legalizing incest derive to legalizing homosexuality ? <eos>

<s> homosexuality is typically a relationship between equal parties . incest contrarily is much more prone to abusive relationships between older and older siblings father and daughters or son and daughter before these persons could be considered `` consenting adults '' . it is this inherent prospect of abuse that makes incest different than homosexuality and compel the state to intervene . <eos>

@highlight

<s> adulterous relationships are more prone to abuse than homosexual ones . <eos>
