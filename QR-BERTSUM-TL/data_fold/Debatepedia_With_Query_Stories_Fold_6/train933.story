<s> vs britannica : is wikipedia better than britannica ? <eos>

<s> traditionally dictionaries are based on the reputation of particular authors . these authors though small in number are highly interested and ostensibly qualify to find good sources for their information and are therefore expected to produce good quality articles - however they are not immune to human error . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trust in britannica 's credential over wikipedia is misplaced ; humans error in both . <eos>
