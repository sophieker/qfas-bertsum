<s> crime : is downloaded a crime ? <eos>

<s> mp # files are multimedia and considered intellectual property . when you buy cd 's you 're buying a pieces of plastic . in other words mp # files are not things you can touch or even listening to . you can only listening to them if you have them downloaded on mp # players which you buy at retail stores . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trading mp # files is not think stealing a cd from a store . <eos>
