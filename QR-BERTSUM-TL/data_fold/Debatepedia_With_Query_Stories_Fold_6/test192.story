<s> universal laws : can national laws break `` universal '' laws justifying civil disobedience ? <eos>

<s> national laws can not be the ultimate authority - men and women are also under higher laws . it was established in the nuremberg trials that sometimes international laws must override national ones . many christian thinkers ( such as martin luther king ) and other philosophers have argued that the law of god or natural law is paramount and that national laws which do not accord with it are unjust and should be resisted . even under the theory of social contract the state can be resisted if it becomes oppressive and so breaks its side of the contract .

<s> if a law breaks universal laws then that law must be broken . <eos>
