<s> government : is a fat tax justified in shaping social ends ? <eos>

<s> your physical appearance generates options and sets ones value on the sexual market . people who take care of themselves are more efficient healthier and happier . because there is little dispute about the merits of health to both the individual and to the broader society governments may be justified in creating incentives for producing such desired ends for all individuals . <eos>

<s> a healthy physique is a universal good for individuals in society . <eos>
