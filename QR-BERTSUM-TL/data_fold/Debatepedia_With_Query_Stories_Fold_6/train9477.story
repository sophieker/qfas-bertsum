<s> due dessert ? does plea negotiations in exchange for testimony violates the notions of due dessert ? <eos>

<s> this notion holds that particular crimes and circumstances should lead to or deserve particular punishments . only when due desert is applied can it be said that justice is served . plea bargaining reaches settlements that are not an stringent measure of what a criminal deserves but simply of what can be satisfactorily agreed forth between the prosecutor and defendant . the punishment falls somewhere in the middle of these parties instead of on a place of due desert and justice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> plead bargaining violates the law notion of caused desert : <eos>
