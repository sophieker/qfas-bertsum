<s> family violence : does arrangement marriage resulting in more abuse and divorce violence ? <eos>

<s> the institution of marriage always creates interdependence and thus scope for abuse and danger and the police and outsiders always find it more difficult to intervened where violence is within a marriage . this is a criticism of marriage per se and not arrangement and we can t ban marriage . the vulnerabilities of those without languages skills is an accepted fact of immigration policy again it applies to all immigration and not to arranged marriages . finally most marriage organizers are actually women as in the auntie system in india . they gain prestige and authority through their role . this doesn t seem to oppress women . what you are really saying is that islamic societies are patriarchal and that muslims have arranged marriages . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arranged marriages in europe and south america have idiosyncratically low level of abuse and divorce violence . <eos>
