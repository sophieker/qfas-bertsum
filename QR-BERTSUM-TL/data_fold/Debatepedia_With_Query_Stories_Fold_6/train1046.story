<s> science : is a new moon landing better for scientific research ? <eos>

<s> since the moon does affect the earth more directly and strongly than the planet mars would n't it be most logical to study the object with the most impact first . we have barely scratched the surface ( literally and figuratively ) of moon research and something that affects the earth in such a great magnitude should most defintely researched thoroughly before other celestial bodies such as the planet mars . <eos>

@highlight

<s> moon affects earth more than mars so should be returned to . <eos>
