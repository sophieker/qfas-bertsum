<s> military recruiting : does nclb rightly allow military recruiting in schools ? <eos>

<s> nclb ( in section # ) requires public secondary schools to provide military recruiters the same access to facilities as a school provides to higher education institution recruiters . schools are also required to provide contact information for every student to the military if requested and schools are not required to tell the students or parents . students or parents can opt out of having their information shared. < ref > ( nd ) sec . # . armed forces recruiter access to students and student recruiting information . department of education . retrieved # / # / # . < /ref > < ref > ( nd ) military free zone . website . retrieved # / # / # . < /ref > currently many school districts have a generic opt out form which if filled out and turned in withholds students ' information from college and job recruiters as well as the military . <eos>

<s> facilitating military recruitment through nclb is wrong <eos>
