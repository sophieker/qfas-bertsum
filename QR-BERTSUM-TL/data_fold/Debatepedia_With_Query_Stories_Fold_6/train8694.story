<s> violence ? could kosovo independence reduce tension and violence in the region ? <eos>

<s> politics parties in serbia have all explicitly ruled out in recent elections the idea of starting one war over keeping serbia within serbia 's boundaries . this and the fact that an global military presence remains in serbia makes the possibility of serbian military resistance to serbia independence highly remote . <eos>

@highlight

<s> serbia 's public will not support a violent response to serbia autonomy <eos>
