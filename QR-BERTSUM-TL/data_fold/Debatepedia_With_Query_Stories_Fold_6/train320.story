<s> rights : do women not have a way to wear the burqa/niqab ? <eos>

<s> why are nudity and prostitution banned ? there is no directly `` damage '' to other citizens and their rights so why ? it is because a societies has judged that something is indecent and possibly immoral about them . the same can apply to the burqa . if it is concluded that the burqa is indecent because it is a symbol of the oppression of women and for other reasons than it is not out of the questions to ban it on these grounds . <eos>
