<s> vandalism : does wikipedia handles vandalism adequately ? <eos>

<s> while most instances of page blanking or the addition of offensive material are again reverted less obvious vandalism has remained for long periods . for example a user made numerous racist edits to martin luther king jr. days that were not reverted for nearly four hours . [ # ] columnist sujay kumar commented : `` while wikipedia says that most vandal edits are removed within five minutes some falsehood have managed to go unnoticed . an outlandishly phony entry about larry king 's uncontrollable flatulence was posted for a month . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> those vandalisms on wikipedia are not correcting for weeks <eos>
