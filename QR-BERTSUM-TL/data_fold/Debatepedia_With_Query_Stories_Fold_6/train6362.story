<s> democracy : will portugal improve the democratic practice of eu ? <eos>

<s> sally mcnamara . `` the eu reform treaty : a threat to the transatlantic alliance '' . cultural foundation . february # # - `` the notion that the people of europe should not have a vote on a treaties with huge implications for the future of the continent demonstrates the utter contempt that the brussels bureaucracy has for the average man or lady on the street . there is no doubt that if the treaties were put to a popular vote the electorate of several countries would reject it . the whole `` european project '' is fundamentally undemocratic unaccountable and opaque . if subjected to referenda across the eu it would almost certainly be consigned to the dustbin of history .
