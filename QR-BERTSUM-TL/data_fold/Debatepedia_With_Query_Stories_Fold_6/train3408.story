<s> society : would a ban on slapping help reduce violence in the community ? <eos>

<s> there are clear correlations in a society between poverty and violence availability of weapon and violence widespread drug use and violence absence of children and violence . the assertion of a link between smacking and society violence is highly questionable given the cross-national variation between level of violence and crime between nations with the same policies on smacking as but as the strength of correlation with other factors . this is no more than an assertion of hippy faith . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the evidence for this is non-existent . <eos>
