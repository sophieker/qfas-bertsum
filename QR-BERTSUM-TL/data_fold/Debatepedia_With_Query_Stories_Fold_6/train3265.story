<s> race/gender analogies : is dadt analogous to past ban on blacks and women ? <eos>

<s> barry m. goldwater . `` ban on gays is senseless attempt to stall the inevitable '' - `` years ago i was a lieutenant in charge of an all-black unit . military leaders at the time believed that blacks lacked leadership potential - period . that seems ridiculous now as it should . now each and every man and woman who serves this nation takes orders from a black man - our own gen. colin powell . [ ... ] nobody thought that blacks or women could ever be integrated into the military . many thought that an all-volunteer force could never protect our national interest . well it has and despite those who feared the worst - i among them - we are still the best and will continue to be . <eos>
