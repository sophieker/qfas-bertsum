<s> animal benefits : do animals generally benefit from advances made in animal testing ? <eos>

<s> it is only acceptable to test human medicines on human beings if they give their consent . non-human animals are never able to give such consent . it is therefore never acceptable to test medicines on perfectly healthy animals even if the treatments are for use on other animals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> humans must give consent before medicines are tested on them - animals never give consent <eos>
