<s> saving lives ? can torture help save innocent lives ? <eos>

<s> a country that performs torture can expect its enemies to exploit this fact as a tool for rallying even greater hatred around their cause . as this seed of hatred is strengthened it can be expected that a country 's enemies will be more effective in recruiting for their cause . this puts a country at greater general risk than before . while instances of torture might be cited as having saved lives the general existence of torture as a rallying call for terrorists may lead to a greater loss of lives in the long-run . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nations committing torture rally an even greater hatred from their enemies <eos>
