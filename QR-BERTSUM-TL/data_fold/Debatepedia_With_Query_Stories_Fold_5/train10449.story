<s> religious philosophy : are religious philosophies typically detrimental or advantageous in society ? <eos>

<s> once we needed deities or deity to explain our world and to give us some hope of purpose . god is a trap for lazy people who find it easier to have someone think for them . science has explained many of the processes of the cosmic that were once gods . god also provides humanity ( in their vanity ) a gift purposes beyond that of other life . our arrogance caused us to believe we are gift so we created god and an afterlife . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we no longer want god . <eos>
