<s> individual rights : are insurance mandates consistent with individual rights ? <eos>

<s> kyle b. jones . `` mandates necessary for reform cost control . '' the salt lake tribune . october # # : `` when a significant number of patients is unable to pay for care such as the # percent of americans currently in that situation not only do costs increase for everyone but quality of care decreases as limited human and material resources are drained to support those unable to financially contribute to the system . [ ... ] evidence strongly supports that these issues already significantly affect all of us directly or indirectly . when someone without insurance gets sick we all get to pay the price . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> uninsured degrade care for all ; mandates appropriate <eos>
