<s> global warming : do natural gas vehicles help cut emissions fight global warming ? <eos>

<s> methane is a much worse greenhouse gas than c02 . methane is very prominent within `` natural gas '' . this is of concern because the drilling and transportation of natural gas will inevitably lead to leaks and large-scale `` spills '' that will release this highly harmful gas into the atmosphere and contribute substantially to global warming . these risks should not be taken . <eos>
