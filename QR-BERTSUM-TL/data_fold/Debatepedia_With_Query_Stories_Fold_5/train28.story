<s> producer states : what effect does the wars on drug have on producer countries ? <eos>

<s> the united states ' `` war on drugs '' has added considerably to the political instability in south america . the huge profits to be made from cocaine and other south american-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighboring nation . this drives people in the relatively poor nations of colombia peru bolivia and brazil to break their own laws in organising the cultivation preparing and trafficking of cocaine to the states . this has allowed criminal paramilitaries and guerilla groups to reap huge profits exacerbating been serious law-and-order and political problems .
