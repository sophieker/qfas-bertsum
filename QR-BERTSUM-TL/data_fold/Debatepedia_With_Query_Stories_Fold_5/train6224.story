<s> moral hazard : do advances in science corrode moral pillars of our society ? <eos>

<s> had n't it been for modernization we would still be hunting animals and living in caves . modernization means that our priorities and needs change ; we move from satisfying basic needs to satisfying more complex or abstract ones such as justice love security or morality . it means that progress naturally moves morality up on our priority ladder and thus only thanks to science can we lead more than just `` lives of quiet desperation `` . <eos>

@highlight

<s> science increases our quality of life . <eos>
