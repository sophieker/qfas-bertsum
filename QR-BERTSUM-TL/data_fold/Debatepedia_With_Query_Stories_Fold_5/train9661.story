'' the atlantic . october # : `` women are more likely to look at pornography than in the past but they remain considerably more hostile to porn than men are and considerably than likely to make use of it . ( even among the internet generation the splitting between the genders remains stark . a survey of american college students last year found that # percent of the women in the sample never looked at pornography compared with just # percent of their male peers ; nearly half of the men surveyed looked at porn at least once a week vs. just # percent of the women . ) '' <eos>
