<s> is killing civilians `` for the greater good '' justifiable ? <eos>

<s> natural rights are violating due to fatalities by terrorists . imagine rights as a infinte numbers no matter what you multiplied it by it 's still infinity and that is the value of rights . how do we know we acheived for the greater good ? we do n't the greater good is justice and justice is never attainable because it may be justified in one 's eye but not the other . thus it is n't justified to kill an infinite numbers of rights for justice because we can not achieve justice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> violates liberties and justification can not be achieved . <eos>
