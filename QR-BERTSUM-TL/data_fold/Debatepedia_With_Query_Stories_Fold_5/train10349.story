<s> public discourse : are negative ads welcomed in the public discourse ? <eos>

<s> given that rival candidates and parties often agree with each other on the big topics of the day their personalities and ability are highly relevant to voters trying to decide between them . political ads both positive and negative are one important ways for voters to get a rounded picture of a candidate . in any case with your proposal political will still be all about the own but it will be about presenting candidates as saints rather than an environment in which both positive and negative opinion can be quite voiced . <eos>

@highlight

<s> modern political is much less about ideologies than was the cases twenty years ago : <eos>
