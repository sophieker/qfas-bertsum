<s> proportionality : was russia 's response proportional to georgia 's initial action ? <eos>

<s> russia 's intervened in south ossetia to protect russians from georgia 's hard-handed military intervention in south ossetia which resulted in a significant humanitarian crisis . some claim that upwards of # # civilians had died in the south ossetian capital tskhinvali as a result of georgian military operations there most of them russian citizens . russia 's constitution requires that it protect its citizens no matter where they are in the world . russia aggressive response to the death of so many of its citizens was therefore justified . <eos>
