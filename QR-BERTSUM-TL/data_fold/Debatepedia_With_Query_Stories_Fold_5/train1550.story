<s> globally warming : is photovoltaic power key to reducing emission and fighting globally warming ? <eos>

<s> because solar energy can not supply energy at night and is depend on good weather it requires back-up sources of energy to fill the gaps . these back-up sources are often coal-based since coal is the predominant gasoline driving energy production . this means that solar power 's inconsistencies has negative consequences for the environment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> inconsistency photovoltaic electricity requires back-up sources ( carbon-based ) . <eos>
