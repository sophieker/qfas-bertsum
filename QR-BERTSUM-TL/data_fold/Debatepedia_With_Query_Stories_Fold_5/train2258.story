<s> marriage benefits : would giving polygamous marriage benefits create problems ? <eos>

<s> regardless of whether polyamorous relationship are appropriate or if it 's appropriate for people to have polygamous marriage ceremonies in religious institutions the benefits provided by legally recognized marriage pose serious problems . a group of people such as a street gang corrupt public officials corrupt businessmen or even a terrorist cell could get legally married to avoid testifying against each other in court . divorce proceedings would be complicated . even if just another spouse was getting a divorce last marriage involves sharing property so the court would have to figure out who came what into the marriage to protect the property of the spouses not getting divorced . determining child custody would also be difficult . which spouses are eligible for custody rights ? all <eos>

@highlight

<s> recognizing polygamy would cause a host of legal either . <eos>
