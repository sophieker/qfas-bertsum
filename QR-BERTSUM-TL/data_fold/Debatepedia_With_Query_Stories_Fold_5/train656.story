<s> arms race : would a nuclear iran spark an global arms race ? <eos>

<s> an october # report by the army 's strategic studies institute argues that `` iran s continued insistence that it acquired its nuclear capabilities legally under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty ( npt ) would if unquestioned encourage its neighbors ( including afghanistan saudi arabia egypt syria turkey and algeria ) to develop nuclear options of their own by emulate iran s example by overtly declaring possessions ( in israel s case ) or by importing nuclear weapons ( in saudi arabia s case ) . such announcements and efforts in turn would likely undermine nuclear nonproliferation restraint internationally and strain american relationships with most of its key friends in the middle east .
