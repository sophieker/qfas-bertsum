<s> counter-terrorism : is pakistan failing to do enough making us intervention necessary ? <eos>

<s> they hate the radicals . the pakistani people are victims of the terrorists and only 0.2 % of the entire pakistani population actually sympathizes with the taliban and that support is one garnered by subversion . therefore it is not valid to claim that the pakistani people are harboring terrorists and the taliban . with the proper policies the pakistani people would support us-pakistani efforts to rid their country of terrorists . but unilateral actions would likely create the opposite effect perhaps causing the pakistani population to grow angrier at the united state 's policies and perhaps sympathize more with radicals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the pakistani people do not support terrorists and the taliban . <eos>
