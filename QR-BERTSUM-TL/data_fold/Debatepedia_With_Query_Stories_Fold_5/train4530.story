<s> accountability : do education vouchers enable strong accountability and standards ? <eos>

<s> education vouchers erode educational standards by allowing public funding to go to private programs that may not reflect strong national educational standards . school vouchers also decentralize control over schools creating a scattering of programs instead of a core educational standard based on our highest educational ideals . it is generally important that schools be held accountable to a single national standard but education vouchers have the potential to undermine such a standard and the ability to hold schools to account on a national scale . <eos>
