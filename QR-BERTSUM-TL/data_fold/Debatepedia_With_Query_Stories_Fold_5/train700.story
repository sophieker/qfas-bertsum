<s> does junk foods advertising contribute to obesity problems ? <eos>

<s> just because the junk food is being advertised does not mean that parents should purchase it for their child or give their child the cash to purchase it . it is important to recognizing that parents have the final say and also are ultimately responsible for what their child eat . it matters bit therefore that child might be swayed by advertisements . we should place higher onus of responsibilities on parents and if we are concerned that they are buying junk food for their child we should attempt to address that problem . but this has less to do with junk-food advertising and more to do with inform the health decisions of parents . <eos>

@highlight

<s> junk food advertisements does not forces parents to buy the food . <eos>
