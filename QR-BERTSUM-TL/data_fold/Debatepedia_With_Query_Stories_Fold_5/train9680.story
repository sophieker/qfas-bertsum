<s> systemic bias : does wiki avoid systemic bias ? <eos>

<s> wiki has been accused of systemic bias a tendency to covers topics in a detail disproportionate to their importance . as an example stephen stephen once faux-praised wiki for having a `` longer entry on 'lightsabers ' than it does on the 'printing press . ' '' some call this `` geek priorities '' . there are many long and well-written articles on obscure characters in science fiction/fantasy and very specialised issues in computer science physics and math . other topics areas are less active . <eos>
