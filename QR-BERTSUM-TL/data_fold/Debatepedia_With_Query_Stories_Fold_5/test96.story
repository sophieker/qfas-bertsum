<s> militia : does the # nd amendments secure an individual right to forms an independent militia ? <eos>

<s> eventually the right to bear arm is in itself an expression of liberty in the face of government powers and control . upholding this symbols is perhaps the most important check that the right to bear arm can place on government powers as it symbolic spills into other fields of individual freedom . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the # nd amendment protects the ability to form a militia not the ongoing existence of one . <eos>
