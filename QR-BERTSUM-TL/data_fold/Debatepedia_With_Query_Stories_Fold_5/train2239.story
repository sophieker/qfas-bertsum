<s> iranian response ? would iran respond in a catastrophic fashion ? <eos>

<s> as radio free europe/ radio liberty reports `` defense secretary robert gates has described as based on 'hard fact ' u.s. assertions that an elite branch of iran 's revolutionary guards corps is training and arming shi'ite extremists in neighboring iraq . u.s. president george w. bush recently accused iran 's quds force of supplying weapons including armor-piercing bombs that were used to kill u.s . soldiers . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> iran is already undermining u.s. interests in iraq ; there 's not much more they can do to retaliate there . <eos>
