<s> serving justice : can justice be further served by prosecuting wwii wars criminals ? <eos>

<s> wwii was so long ago that these individuals were usually very younger and of low rank . they may have had not choice in committing war crimes . if they had resisting they probably would have been killed so in effect they performing these acts under duress . they were which frequently not german add to the consideration that they ca n't be held fully responsible . most of the major figures responsible for atrocities are now dead . for this reason there is little remaining potential for justice to be furthered . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nazis war criminals uncovered now were normally just following orders and so they are n't fully responsibility for their acts : <eos>
