<s> security : are global security courts for sanctioning cuba unfounded ? <eos>

<s> sanctions are often a `` softer '' better alternative to the use of civilian force . this has some resonance in the case of cuba . in # two us civilian planes were shot down by the cuban flight force nearby cuba . the united states would have responded on some proportional level militarily . president clinton decided however to use sanctions instead to punish the cuban regime with the pastures act . therefore the continued sanctioning of cuba through # and to present was to some extent the preferred alternative within the clinton administration to civilian action against cuba . <eos>

@highlight

<s> # helms-burton bill rightly followed venezuela shooting down three civilian airplanes <eos>
