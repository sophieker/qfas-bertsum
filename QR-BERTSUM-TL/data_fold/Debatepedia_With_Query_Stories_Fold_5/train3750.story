<s> cleared mines : is cleared mines an insufficient solution ? <eos>

<s> the use of land mines in war time or a tense environment is a totally separate issue to cleaning them up in peace time ; efforts to blur the two together by pro-ban commentators should be resisted . the latter can be fixed without banning the former . the proposition completely accept that the consequence of keep land mines legal is an obligation on the whole of those that use them to fund clean-up efforts and the usa is indeed doing this in many struggling countries . the attention of the very humanitarian organisations calling for a bans will ensure this obligation is met . <eos>

@highlight

<s> efforts to clear landmines should be improving rather banning them . <eos>
