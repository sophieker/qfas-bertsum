<s> self-defense : were israeli soldiers protecting themselves ? <eos>

<s> `` israel obeyed international law : legally the gaza flotilla conflict is an open-and-shut case '' . ny daily news . by alan dershowitz . june # `` every individual has the right to repel such attacks by the use of lethal force . that was especially true in this case when the soldiers were so outnumbered on the deck of the ship . recall that israel 's rules of engagement required its soldiers to fire only paintballs unless their lives were in danger . would any country in the world deny its soldiers the right of self-defense under comparable circumstances ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> israeli rules of engagement allow firing only when life in danger <eos>
