<s> cars insurances analogy : are mandates analogous to cars insurances mandates ? <eos>

<s> mandatory car insurance is accept as an important and necessary means of protecting other drivers so too should health insurance mandates be accept as a means of protecting other taxpayers . if one drivers hit another and does great damaging to the car and individual it is necessary that the drivers has health insurance to paying for the damages . if they do not than the blameless injuries party will not be adequately compensated and may be left footing the bill for life-long medical bills . the analogy with health insurance is that `` freeriders '' without insurance are making health insurance intolerably expensive for everybody else . they should therefore be required to purchase health insurance to protect the other `` drivers '' in society . this analogy <eos>

@highlight

<s> mandatory healthcare insurances is analogous to mandatory cars insurances <eos>
