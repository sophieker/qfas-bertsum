<s> society : would a ban on smacking helping reducing violence in the community ? <eos>

<s> there are clear correlations in a society between inequality and violent availability of weapons and violent widespread drug use and violent absence of parents and violence . the assertion of a link between slapping and social violent is extremely dubious given the cross-national variation between levels of violent and crime between countries with the same policies on slapping as but as the strength of correlations with other factors . this is no more than an assertion of hippy faith . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the findings for this is non-existent . <eos>
