<s> routinely arming the police is an effective deterrent to criminal behaviour ; most countries in europe and north america routinely arm police officers in part to discourage criminal acts . armed criminals operate in at least some areas in almost each jurisdiction . same this a failures to routinely arm the police giving armed criminals a strong advantage in terms of their ability to threaten and commit violence without any corresponding risks to themselves . <eos>
