<s> state interests : are state interests upholding in the primary election process ? <eos>

<s> both democrat and republican parties have national and state entities . state parties are to the national party organizations as states are to the federal government . state parties have somewhat of an independent interest that must be foremost in the wider electoral process . primaries achieve this by empower state parties to play a part in formulating the process by which delegates will be selected in the primaries . given the importance of state power in the united states it is necessary to keep state parties relevant in this way through the previous primary system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we primaries give needed power to state parties <eos>
