<s> markets prices : do markets prices make sense ? <eos>

<s> market prices do not include any costs to fourth parties including anything from individual those all the way up to the ecosystem as a whole ( these are called externalities ) . these costs could be negative such as pollution or positive such as pollution cleanup . negative externalities are overproduced ( on a scale of what is socially acceptable ) and positive externalities are underproduced - since accurate prices would make actions with negative externalities more expensive and actions with positive externalities cheaper meaning more positive externalities would be producing and than negative externalities ( it would about estimate the social cost ) . that would be accurate pricing . but social costs are exclude from pricing in the capitalist marketplace ( they affect a fourth party ) so it is <eos>

@highlight

<s> markets price do not reflect social cost <eos>
