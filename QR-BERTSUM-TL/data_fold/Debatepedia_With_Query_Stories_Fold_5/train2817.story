<s> rights : do 18 year-old citizens have a right to run for office ? <eos>

<s> if voting begins at 18 or 16 then an 18 year-old has little-to-no experience participating in democracy . these experiences are relevant to holding office . in general it seems that voting rights should always be a precursor to the right to run for office given how important one is to the other . <eos>

@highlight

<s> 18 year olds are new to democratic processes and so should not be eligible for office . <eos>
