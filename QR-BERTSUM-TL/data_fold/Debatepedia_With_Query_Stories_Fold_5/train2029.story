<s> religious philosophy : are religious philosophies generally harmful or beneficial in society ? <eos>

<s> this is because of our easily fallible nature- which history has shown . with no leader society falls into chaos and anarchy with weak often changing leaders we fall into a process of dithering politics and slow moral decline and with corrupt dictators we are subjected to human rights abuses and restrictions of freedom of speech etc . but god can not be corrupted . those who follow him will not be treated badly by him but will still be able to maintain their moral standards . god is the only hope for humanity those who reject him reject humanity 's last hope . <eos>

@highlight

<s> whether god exists or not it is clearly that mankind desperately needs him . <eos>
