<s> are we currently testing athletes too much ? <eos>

<s> if athletes know when tests will be or the tests are infrequent athletes could easily get away with using drugs . andrew johns a former australian nrl player used drugs for ten years while playing sport . if he was tested once out of the testing routine they would have picked up that he was using drugs . we 're not suggesting three times a day or anything but it ca n't be too infrequent . <eos>
