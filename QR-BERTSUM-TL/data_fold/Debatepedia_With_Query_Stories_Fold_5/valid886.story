<s> civilian feasibility : would an attack be capable of disabling iran 's nuclear program ? <eos>

<s> senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the brookings institution kenneth pollack writes on page # of the persian puzzle that `` if the america states could destroy all or even keys elements or iran 's nuclear programs it probably would not end the programs but it could set it back very considerably . since the keys is to keeping nuclear weapons out of the hand of the current regime such a delay could be all that is necessary . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the lack of complete knowledge is not a reason to preclude attacks . <eos>
