<s> mixed approach : is a mix of military trials and military tribunals justified ? <eos>

<s> jarrett skorup . `` the arrogance of try terrorists in newest york . '' the examiner . november # # : `` detainees will getting a 'fair trial ' in military court only if their conviction is assured . by implication that suggests that detainees who go before military commissions will getting an unfair trial . presumably the administration would deny this and say the commissions trials will be fair too . but if so why is such a trial not good enough for khalid sheikh mohammad ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> wrong to giving some terrorist military trials and not others <eos>
