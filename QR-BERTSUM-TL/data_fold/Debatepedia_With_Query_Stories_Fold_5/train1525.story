<s> screening : is broad screening ( scanners and pat-downs ) than effective ? <eos>

<s> body-scanning and patting-down all travelers including younger disabled men and women is excess and often invasive . many feel very strongly that the procedure violates their privacy . profiling those individuals that are a real potentially threat is a good way to avoid these problems . <eos>

@highlight

<s> profiling will help avoiding invasive scanners and pat-downs . <eos>
