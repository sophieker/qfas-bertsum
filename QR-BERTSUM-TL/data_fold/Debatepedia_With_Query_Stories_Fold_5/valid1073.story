<s> installation : is the installation of tidal energy difficult ? <eos>

<s> the installation of tidal energy turbines and barrages requires special barges that are not cheap to manufacture . this is related to the fact that installing anything deep underwater is difficult and thus expensive . the problem is compounded by the fact that installation must take place while the tides are moving . this is not an easy engineering feet particularly when some tidal energy units are planted in water that is 30-meters deep . <eos>
