<s> pakistan government : would the pakistani government tolerate a bilateral us strike ? <eos>

<s> what if the america states had ideal information that osama bin laden was in a specific buildings or cave in pakistan but it was not certain that he would be there for more than # minutes . should the america states ask permission from the pakistan government to attack even if the time required to ask permission could possibly close the window of opportunity to capturing or kill bin laden . if this circumstance arose and the america states took action it seems that the pakistan government should be willing to tolerating the exceptional nature of the incident . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the pakistani government should tolerate a unilateral us capture of bin laden if the intelligence is fleeting . <eos>
