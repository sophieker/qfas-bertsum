<s> war on terror : is it wrong to think the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> critics of a withdrawal often argue that it would embolden terrorists . while this may be true this completely ignores the fact that the war itself emboldened terrorists more than anything else . it continues to embolden them with a cause . while withdrawing may be a `` success '' for terrorists and embolden them in this way it will take away their cause of `` expelling the crusader '' which is the foundation of their support across the muslim world . <eos>

@highlight

<s> withdrawing from iraq may embolden terrorists but the war itself emboldens them <eos>
