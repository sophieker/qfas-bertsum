<s> learning : does it lead to improved learning in its broadest sense ? <eos>

<s> because no child left behind makes passing test such a central priority teacher do n't have much of an incentive to spend when helping those that are already likely to passes nor those that are highly unlikely to passes ( it would be wasted energy ) . the greatest bang-for-the-buck for teacher under threat from nclb penalties is to focus on students that are just below the passing grade . this is unfortunate because every child should be given equals attention to grow regardless of their abilities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nclb getting teachers to over-focus on those just below passing <eos>
