<s> consumption : has the # age-limit failed to reduce under-age drinking ? <eos>

<s> rather it has encouraged youngsters to fall into the clutches of this really dangerous addiction . it is not at all a good idea as teenagers who are already at a very tender age of falling prey to certain not-so-good mistakes further get a valid license to consume alcohol and damage their livers and ruin their lives . they acquire this awful habit and get addicted to it very quickly and it not only affects their health but harshly destroys their overall personality . the thing which all know is dangerous needs to be banned and not legalised for teenaged people . <eos>
