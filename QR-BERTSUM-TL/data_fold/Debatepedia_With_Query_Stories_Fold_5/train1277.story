<s> `` why explore for oil ? '' the economist . april # nd # > `` the fundamental problem is this : there is a finite amount of fossil fuel . the more of it we find and burn the more carbon we putting into the atmosphere and the more severe the greenhouse effect becomes . once the carbon is in the atmosphere it stays there . if we want to limit climate change what we have to do one way or another is to leave fuel in the soil wherever possible not find and burn them .
