<s> centralization/sovereignty : is greater centralization a good thing ? <eos>

<s> the lisbon treaty does not add sweeping new powers to the eu over national governments . rather it clarifies existing powers and responsibilities and streamlines the relations between the eu and national governments so that they can work more effectively . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lisbon treaty reforms the eu ; it does not give it broad new powers <eos>
