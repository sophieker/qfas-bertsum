<s> enforcement : is a bans on bestiality unenforceable ? <eos>

<s> the laws should not consider the expediency of enforcement . the question is only if a laws is just . in the case of bestiality a ban is just for the reasons presented here so is justified . it does not matter that enforcement of the laws may be difficult or appear harsher on those that violate the law . if individuals deciding that they are above the laws and able to violate it they should be punished in the same way as any other individual . <eos>

@highlight

<s> difficult enforcement is no causes for legalizing incest . <eos>
