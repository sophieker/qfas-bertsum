<s> school choice : does k-12 offer better choice of schools to student and parents ? <eos>

<s> no child left behind is intended to provide resource to students that are `` failing '' to leave and be transported to other schools where they may be more successful . but the `` succeeding '' child in these `` failing '' schools are actually the ones utilizing the funding to go to other schools making this a mis-allocation and use of funding .
