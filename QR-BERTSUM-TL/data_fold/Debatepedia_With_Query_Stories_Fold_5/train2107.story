<s> sectoral standards : are globally sectoral standards a bad/good idea ? <eos>

<s> these are standards set across a specific industry most importantly manufacture for the purpose of ensure that similar factories around the world are held to the same emissions standards . this is important because measurement the total emissions of a nation does not provide much useful information . what is more important is that the most polluting industries around the world are held to the same standards . they are also important because they prevent the shifting of production to countries with lower standards for specific factories in an industry . on this point ian brady - director of the trade association uk steel - said that a european carbon limit alone `` is not going to curb emissions . it will just move the emissions <eos>

@highlight

<s> develop countries should be held to global sectoral standards . <eos>
