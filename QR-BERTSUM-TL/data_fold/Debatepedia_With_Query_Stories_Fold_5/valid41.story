<s> religious liberty : is the prohibition of schools prayers consistent religious liberty ? <eos>

<s> the first amendment precludes state interference in the free exercise of religion . formal school prayers merely assist pupils in the free exercise of their religious beliefs the suggestion that those children who wish to engage in prayers could initiate spontaneous prayers without the direction of staff is hopelessly unrealistic . when a congregation attends any formal service of worship they are engage in the free exercise of religion notwithstanding the fact that the members did not write the prayers or hymns or passages they hear speaking singing or recite .
