<s> social : are progressive taxes socially valuable ? <eos>

<s> `` are progressive taxes a good thing ? '' critical mastiff . # aug. # - `` in our present fiscal situation wealthy people and corporations pay high federal income taxes and poorer people pay no income taxes at all or very few . therefore it makes sense for our rational actor the federal government to make laws that give preference to the rich and corporations over the poor since tax revenues respond much more quickly when the rich get richer than when the poor get less poor . such additional revenues can naturally be used to succor the same poor that the government has just victimized making the poor indebted to the government and to the particular elected officials of each district .
