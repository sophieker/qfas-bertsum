<s> general : general statement in support and against reactors energy . <eos>

<s> solar power is more renewables and cleaner . its supply is never-ending unlike that of reactors energy . similarly wind power generates no waste and can sustain our planet for millenia to come . reactors power is not the answer . when there are so many expensive safer cleaning and more sustainable alternatives why the debate ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear energy has a limited supply and is far inferior to solar power . <eos>
