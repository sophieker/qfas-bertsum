<s> fetus rights : is it wrong to assign rights to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> unborn babies have a certain level of consciousness in the womb . this is partly why mothers sometimes walk around with earphones on their stomachs . irrespective of the level of consciousness of unborn babies their central nervous system certainly affords them the ability to feel pain and suffer . for these reasons they should not be aborted . <eos>

@highlight

<s> fetuses are conscious in the womb and suffer during abortions <eos>
