<s> and death penalty : how can people be anti-abortion but pro death penalty ? <eos>

<s> there is no contradiction between opposing abortions and supporting capital punishment as many conservatives do . an abortion involves killing an innocent fetus whereas capital punishment involves killing a guilty terrible human being . one involves killing an unborn baby with the potential to contribute positively to society the other kills a human being that has demonstrated themselves unfit to live in society . the real inconsistency is in supporting abortion while opposing capital punishment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an abortion kills innocents ; capital punishment kills the guilty <eos>
