<s> intelligence sources : is the clandestine trial of detainee justified by the interest in protecting intelligence sources ? <eos>

<s> even when stronger proof exists charging and trying terror suspects in open court could require governments to reveal their intelligence sources . this could risk the identification of their spies in overseas countries and within dangerous organisations . not only might this lead to the murder of brave agents it could also shut off crucial intelligence channels that could warn us of potential attacks . even if special arrangements were made to present intelligence evidence in court hostile organisations could be able to working out how much or little western intelligence service know about them and the manner in which they operate . in these circumstances detention no public trial is the only safe option . <eos>

<s> at a time when our societies is under threat it is more importance to protecting our intelligence sources than it <eos>
