<s> quality : do elections improve the quality of judges ? <eos>

<s> some have proposed a kind of hybrid systems in which judicial elections exist but in which a pre-screening process ensures that all candidates appropriately qualified to become a judge . this maintains the abilities of voters to choose based on their best judgement but also ensures against instances in which wholly unqualified judges are elected to the bench . this along with other possible systems demonstrating that it is unnecessary to entirely eliminate the systems of elections . elections can be maintain while various mechanisms can be worked into place that check against any of the difficulty they may produce . <eos>

<s> screenings can help ensure judicial candidates have sufficient merit . <eos>
