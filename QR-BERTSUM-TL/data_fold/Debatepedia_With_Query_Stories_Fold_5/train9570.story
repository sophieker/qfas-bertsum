<s> products : do ads to children fostering a `` must-have '' mentality ? <eos>

<s> advertising has no magic power to create unnatural desires for material possessions . children who pester are simply horribly brought up . poor parenting and undisciplined children can not be solved by banning advertising as children have many influences upon them which can stimulate their desires for toys etc . particularly their friends . it is also unsubstantiated that children have no spending power of their own ; many children under # receive pocket cash and teenagers are often able to earn a little themselves . learning to manage cash is part of grow up and advertisements help them to choose what they would like to save up for . <eos>

@highlight

<s> bans ads shirks the individual responsibility of children and parents . <eos>
