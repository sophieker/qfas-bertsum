<s> high cholesterol or a high intake of fat can be extremely harmful leading to heart disease obesity and other conditions ; but manufacturers of these products are not punished . consumers simply like the taste of fatty food . people should be allowed to smoke cigarettes and to eat fatty foods - both these things are sources of pleasure which while having serious associated health risks are only fatal after many decades unlike a poisonous food or an unsafe car which pose immediate and high risks .

<s> many products are unhealthy ; alienating cigarettes is unfair . <eos>
