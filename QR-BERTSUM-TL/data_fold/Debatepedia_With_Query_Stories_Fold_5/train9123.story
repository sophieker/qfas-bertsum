<s> rights : do corps generally qualify for personhood/rights ? <eos>

<s> molly morgan a member of the leadership team for the women 's international league for peace and freedom 's : `` it s not a thing it s just an abstraction and that s part of the reason that the strategy of corporate personhood was a brilliant one - they created this artificial thing that could be endowed with any kind of powers and any kind of characteristics . corporations can live forever and live in many nations at once and cut off parts of themselves and this is the entity they have given legal rights and personhood to . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> the idea of corporations being `` people '' is absurd <eos>
