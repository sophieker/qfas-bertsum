<s> illegal aliens : is the convention appropriate in its provisions on illegal immigrants ? <eos>

<s> what constitutes `` unfair treatment '' or `` abuse '' in a nation 's immigration policy is a subject for interpretation under the migrant workers treaty . in the united states for example people can be fined or held legally liable for aiding or employing illegal immigrants . some consider this abusive . and the united states has created a wall on its southern border . is this abusive ? these are all matters for interpretation based on us national interests but the concern is that the un will deem some of these actions or policies `` abusive '' or `` inhumane '' and thereby consider them unlawful under the migrant workers convention . <eos>

<s> `` abusive '' treatment of illegals is a matter of interpretation . <eos>
