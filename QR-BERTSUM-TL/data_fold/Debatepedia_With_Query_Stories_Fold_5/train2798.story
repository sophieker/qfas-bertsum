<s> environment : does a test ban reduce risks to the environment ? <eos>

<s> npt ensures all the signing and ratifying members have a right to nuclear development for peaceful purposes ( i.e . nuclear energy ) . a nuclear test ban helps safeguard this right by reducing some of the suspicions surrounding the development of nuclear energy programs as it makes it more difficult to switch a peaceful program into a weapons program . this generally helps uphold the right of countries to pursue nuclear energy without suspicion and any subsequent limitation or sanctions . in this sense it helps re-enforce the non-proliferation treaty as well as the right to peaceful nuclear energy and makes the enforcement of these treaties easier .
