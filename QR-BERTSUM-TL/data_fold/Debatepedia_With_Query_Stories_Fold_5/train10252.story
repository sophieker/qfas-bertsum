<s> terrorist threat : would iran supply a nuclear weapon to terrorists ? <eos>

<s> joshua muravchik . `` opposing view : iranian bomb 'intolerable ' '' . usa today . november 20 2007 - `` the danger of terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons exists if barely . this would be possible only with a nuclear state s complicity . the political plausibility of any government giving terrorists control of such weapons is next to nil considering the risks involved for the benefactor state . the technical and logistical complexity of such an operation would also be great . '' <eos>
