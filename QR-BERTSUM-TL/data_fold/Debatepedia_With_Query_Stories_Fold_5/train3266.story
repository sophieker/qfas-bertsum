<s> unacceptable ? - is a nuclear iran unacceptable/intolerable/too great a risk ? <eos>

<s> iran 's leadership holds radical islamic views that make it more likely than other countries to take-up the risk of using a nuclear weapon . this radical ideology discounts the faculty of reason making it difficult to count on iran making a sound cost-benefit analysis that using a nuclear weapon is not in their interests and would likely lead to their annihilation . in this way the risks that the iranian regime will use its nuclear weapons against another country are intolerably high . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iran 's radical-islamic regime may be willing to risk using a nuclear weapon against its enemies . <eos>
