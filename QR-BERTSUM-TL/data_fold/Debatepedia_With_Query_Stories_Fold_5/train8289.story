<s> fight terrorism : would the introducing of identification cards help fight terrorism ? <eos>

<s> those of those guilty of terrorist attack such as # / # and the madrid bombings were in the country completely legally and were unknown to the police . the danger is that bringing in cards will create a phony sense of security . if everyone thinks the cards make them safer they will relax their security measures and make it easier for terrorists to strike . we should also realise that our enemies need to force us to changing the ways we live . scrapping age-old rights by introducing identities checks would be a victory for terrorism .
