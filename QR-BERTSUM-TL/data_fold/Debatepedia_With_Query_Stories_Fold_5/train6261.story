<s> economics : is nuclear energy economical ? <eos>

<s> john mccarthy . `` nuclear energy is the most certain source . '' formal.standard : `` nuclear energy is uneconomical compared to other sources . i do n't really have to answer this for the primary objective of showing the sustainability of progress because i need only show that it is economical enough to sustain progress . it seems to me that the french japanese and american experience shows this . as to its relative economy many countries are expanding and initiating programs of nuclear energy . china and indonesia are recent examples . '' [ and why would nuclear energy be expanding internationally if it was n't inherently economical ? ] . <eos>
