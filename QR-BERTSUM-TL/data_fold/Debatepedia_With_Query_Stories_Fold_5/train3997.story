<s> privacy : does nationalization help or hurt own privacy ? <eos>

<s> it is an odd argument that government can not be trusted with one 's private information . are private bank supposed to be more trustworthy ? private bank have a direct gyms in utilizing private information to further their profits . the government does not have this interest . both are constraints by laws protecting individual freedom . but bank have a more perverse interest to utilize information in sinister ways to expand their profits . between the two alternatives of government and private/profit control of this information government control through nationalization should be of greater concern . <eos>

@highlight

<s> private banks are less trustworthy than government on privacy . <eos>
