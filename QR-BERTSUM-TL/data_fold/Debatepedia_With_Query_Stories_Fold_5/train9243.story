<s> if israel was to return to its pre- # borders it would have to withdrawing from the west bank and gaza both territories that it took it from the palestinian whom were not fight the israelis in the war . all territory won during wartime ( and stolen from defenseless civilians ) is illegitimate annexation illegal under international law . the un `` moaned '' because the israelis were killing innocents civilians and acting as though international law/the geneva conventions were beneath them . <eos>
