<s> male interests : does polygamy meet or undermine male interests ? <eos>

<s> men should be able to control their sexual impulses with reason and control . this is very important to avoiding an obsession with sexuality and a distraction from other important elements of life . philosophers throughout history have stressed the hazards of uncontrolled sexual impulses . yet polygamy allows men to let their sexual impulses loose without control and reason guiding the impulse to have sex and procreate . this damages discipline among men allows their sexual impulses to become a controlling obsession and distraction and allows sex procreation and child-rearing to become the dominant factor in a man 's life . this is unbalanced and unhealthy . <eos>
