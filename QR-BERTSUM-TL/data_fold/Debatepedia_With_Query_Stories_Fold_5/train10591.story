<s> economics : is government ownership of water utilities economically efficient ? <eos>

<s> - water infrastructure is very complicated and expensive to build and maintain . while the government would be involvement in supplying all the resources to create this infrastructure it is beneficial to allow the infusion of capital investments in such projects . this can allow for greater funding of these projects and thus a more reliable and quality supply of water . equally important public investments can much more rapidly grow a water infrastructure to meet rapidly growing demand sometimes discovered in emerging economies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rapid growth of waters infrastructures can only be achieved through private investment <eos>
