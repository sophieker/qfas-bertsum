<s> there are indeed new issues raised by the advent of genetic engineering and 'transgenic ' animals ; these like all animal experiment should be strongly monitoring so as to minimize animal suffering . the reason that there are new issues here does not mean that there should ever be any experiment on animals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the genetic modifications of animals need only be but regulated . <eos>
