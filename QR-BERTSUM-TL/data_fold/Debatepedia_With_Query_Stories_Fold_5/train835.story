<s> sarah lacy . `` google s china stance : more about business than thwarting . '' technology crunch . jan # # : `` # . google s business was not doing well in china . does anyone really think google could be doing this if it had top market share in the country ? for one thing i d guess that could open them up to shareholder lawsuits . google is a not-for-profit publicly-held company at the end of the day . when i met with google s former head of china fma lee in beijing last october he noted that one reason he left google was that it was clear the company was never going to substantially increase its market share or beating baidu . google has clearly decided doing business <eos>
