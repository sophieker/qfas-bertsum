<s> morality : were aig 's bonuses morally justified ? <eos>

<s> james surowiecki . `` the a.i.g . bonuses and altruistic punishment '' . new yorker . march 18 2009 - `` when it comes to the a.i.g . bonuses the costs of clawing them back are trivial at best while the public satisfaction at seeing what feels like justice being served will be great . getting all worked up about this money may not strictly speaking be rational but i think that paradoxically if some of this money is clawed back it ll increase the chances that we ll be able to keep dealing with the ongoing crisis in a rational way in the future . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> justice of reneging aig bonuses would be worth costs <eos>
