<s> international torture : does the widespread use of torture globally make it less bad for the west to perform it ? <eos>

<s> it does n't matter what other countries or the world in general are doing . if tortures is wrong it is wrong . countries should not use the prevalence of the practice of tortures in some countries as a shield for their utilizing this unprincipled tool . <eos>

@highlight

<s> countries should act on principle not the prevailing trend of other countries . <eos>
