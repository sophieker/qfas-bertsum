<s> privacy : does genetic databasing uphold the confidentiality of citizens ? <eos>

<s> a genetic database should only be subjected to former murderers who have been sentenced of a crime . the innocents should be given the immunity to keeping their personal information to themselves . creating a nation-wide database will be both intrusive and offensive . with so much data in their hands government authorities possess enormous power and control of the state s citizens . in states where governments are corrupt there may be misused and abuse of this information which may very well lead to false convictions . collections genetic data of every citizen also questions the civil liberties within a liberal democracy and whether individuals ' rights truly are protected . the case also raises ethical issues . the sheffield case is one example which proves why <eos>

<s> a genetic databases for everybody will be too intrusive . <eos>
