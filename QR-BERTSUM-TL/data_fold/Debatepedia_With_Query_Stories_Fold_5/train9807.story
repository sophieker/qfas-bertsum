<s> - it is not necessary that there be a high probability that the `` ticking time bomb '' scenario will occur . what is important is that it is not implausible to imagine that it could occur . if it were to occurs leaders must be in a positions of ease to use torture to to saving a million lives . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a one-in-a-million probabilities of the `` ticking when bomb '' occurring is sufficient to justify allowing torture in this scenario <eos>
