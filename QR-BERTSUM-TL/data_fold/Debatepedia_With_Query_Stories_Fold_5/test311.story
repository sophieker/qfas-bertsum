[ ... ] but that is much good than self-censorship which put google in the troubling businesses of stripping out results from searches about politically touchy studies like china s occupation of tibet and the massacre on tiananmen square by the chinese army . '' this is bad for google because it requires dedicating google employee and resources to this onerous task . <eos>
