<s> national cohesion : does multiculturalism better encourage social cohesion and unity ? <eos>

<s> if we respect someone elses culture then they will obviously accept ours . this is like the golden rule ; treat others as you would like to be treated . accepting their culture will mean acceptance of ours and generally unity is created through this appreciation . many nations have arguably been multicultural since their foundation depending on how one defines multiculturalism . someone will always be from a different area and thus of a different culture . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the unity of society that assimilation talks about can be found through multiculturalism . <eos>
