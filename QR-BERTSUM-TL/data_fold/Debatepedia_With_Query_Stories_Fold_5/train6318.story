<s> entertainment : are video games a good form of entertainment ? <eos>

<s> video games keep people inside . they are generally sedentary activities and can eat your free time up very quickly . many video games are violent and may lead to abnormal behavior . they are also quite repetitive where the gamer does a similar task over and over again trying to improve upon the last time they did it . this does not let the brain think about new and interesting things . using video games for entertainment often leads the gamer to addiction where they sacrifice their free time in order to play more video games . <eos>

<s> video games keep people sitting in front of the tv and inactive . <eos>
