<s> costs : are crime cameras cost-effective ? <eos>

<s> police typically patrol neighborhoods with a certain frequency . it is possible for police to reduce the frequency of their patrolling in neighborhoods with crime cameras . this is due largely to the fact that crime cameras help deter and reduce crime reducing the demand for police patrolling in a certain neighborhood . in addition newer crime cameras can help detect criminal activity and alert officers to attend to suspicious activities . this is why cameras are often viewed as `` extra crime-fighting eyes '' . by helping reduce the need to patrol certain areas crime cameras can help reduce the costs required to support such police patrolling . <eos>
