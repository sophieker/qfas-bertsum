<s> is the liberalisation going to help the developing countries to exploit their comparative advantages ? <eos>

<s> because if we completely liberalize trade with agri-food product middle-income nations are going to take advantage of such action as they are always a step ahead of the ldcs ( least develop countries ) . before the ldcs are capable of growing particular crops they can produce the best there will be another players springing up -- more efficient more developed . that is because the ldcs always faces the competition on the field of agriculture of the middle-income nations as they already have fertilizers and machinery necessary to advance . therefore the desired goal ( to help the poorest of the poor ) is not achieved . <eos>

<s> develop nations will not be able to exploiting their comparative advantages <eos>
