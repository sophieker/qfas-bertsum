<s> will cheaper contraceptives encourage their usage ? <eos>

<s> in britain the amount of taxation on contraceptives is 5 % . 5 % on for instance 2 does not amount to a very large cost ( 10p ) . is a 10p cost enough of an incentive to reduce tax on all contraceptives ? would the reduction in tax just be on condoms or other forms ? if the figure is indeed 17.5 % then admitably the saving is significantly greater but depending on the nation this may not be enough . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the tax is only a tiny percentage of the total price : <eos>
