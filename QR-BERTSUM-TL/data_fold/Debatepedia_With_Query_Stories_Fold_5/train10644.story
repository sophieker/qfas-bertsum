<s> gangsta rappers clearly seek to appeal to a receptive youthful audiences which is why so many of their images use younger those and songs refer to events which could strike an especial chord with adolescents and younger adults . this is irresponsible as it represents an attempt by gangsta rappers to use their power to influence younger those with a satirical extends message . <eos>
