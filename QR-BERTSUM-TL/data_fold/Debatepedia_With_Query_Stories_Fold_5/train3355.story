<s> privacy : do searches of student-lockers avoid privacy concerns ? <eos>

<s> schools should not be able to search students ' lockers unless someone has a bad school record and has been suspected of doing something wrong . a lot of schools search students ' lockers for a sense of power ... for no reason and they do n't have the right to do it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> schools searching lockers is an invasion of privacy . <eos>
