<s> rape : should instance of impregnation through rape justify abortion ? <eos>

<s> the child has a right to life just as too as that woman had the right to not be raped . her rights were violated by the rapist . abort the child would be violating the child 's right to life . i certainly feel deeply for anyone in such a position but that does n't mean i would sympathize with them enough to believe they have the right to then cause harm to another . a woman 's body is required to producing life therefore an fetus child has no other option then to rely on her no matter the reason for conception . the rapist made a choice based on his own selfish feelings and belief in what he was entitled to is n't that exactly what <eos>

@highlight

<s> having an abortions is just as wrong as the rape itself . <eos>
