<s> is the libertarian viewpoint right wing ? <eos>

<s> noam chomsky - `` there is n't much point arguing about the word 'libertarian . ' it would make about as much sense to argue with an unreconstructed stalinist about the word 'democracy ' -- recall that they called what they 'd constructed 'peoples ' democracies . ' the weird offshoot of ultra-right individualist anarchism that is called 'libertarian ' here happens to amount to advocacy of perhaps the worst kind of imaginable tyranny namely unaccountable private tyranny . if they want to call that 'libertarian ' fine ; after all stalin called his system 'democratic . ' but why bother arguing about it ? '' [ 12 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no point in defining a radical form anarchism ( libertarianism ) <eos>
