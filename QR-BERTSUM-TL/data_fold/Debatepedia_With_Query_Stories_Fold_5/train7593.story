<s> private anxiety : would castrate help relax private anxieties ? <eos>

<s> the proposition has admitted that fairy hunts take place over sexual offenders and these are by definition not motivated by rational considerations . just as declaring a mass murderer rehabilitated could not put his neighbours at ease . also the jail violence and indeed other violence is not so too motivated by a fear of re-offence as by the desire to punish further for the original crime . castrate could not help under these circumstances . it is an unproven and unsubtle method that deserves no place in a modern penal system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> castration could not ends public anxiety . <eos>
