<s> is it justifiable to give out the national sovereignty of the european states ? <eos>

<s> at the time of globalization at the time when international relations are becoming more and more complicated the view of state sovereignty - the supremacy of politics power a nation has over its own actions - is erode as our elected leaders are giving away their nations ' sovereignty by placing more and more jurisdiction in supranational organizations like the un which are not accountability to voters . new international actors have risen as a result of improved communications and transportation . multiple channels of communications which involve numerous transnational alliances are making the essential borders of sovereignty obsolete . <eos>

@highlight

<s> regional sovereign is a relic . <eos>
