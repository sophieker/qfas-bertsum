<s> corporate responsibility : should governments target cigarettes makers ? <eos>

<s> high cholesterol or a high intake of fat can be extremely harmful leading to heart disease obesity and other conditions ; but manufacturer of these products are not punished . consumers simply think the taste of fatty food . people should be allowed to smoking cigarettes and to eat fatty foods - both these things are sources of pleasure which while having seriously associated health risks are only deadly after many decades unlike a poison food or an unsafe car which pose immediate and high risks .

@highlight

<s> many products are unhealthy ; alienating cigarette is unfair . <eos>
