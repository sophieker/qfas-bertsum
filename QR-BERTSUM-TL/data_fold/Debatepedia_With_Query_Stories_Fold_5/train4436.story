<s> fighting drug use : is random drug testing an effective meaning to deterring drug use ? <eos>

<s> current measures to tackle drug at the source ( i.e . by imprisoning dealers and breaking the supplies chain ) are not succeeding . it is especially important to protect teenagers at an impressionable age and at the time when their attitude to education greatly affects their entire lives . some sacrifice of human rights is required to tackle the drugs problem . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is a clear and present problem with drug use among teenagers in those countries . <eos>
