<s> human rights : has china failed to improve its human rights and is a boycott the way response ? <eos>

<s> in regards to sending a powerful message to the chinese government that they need to improve their human rights record there are few other tool at a country 's disposal than boycotting the olympics . the united states has passed resolutions that condemn the chinese human rights abuses but this has no estate international impact on the chinese . neither will protests at the games themselves sending a sufficiently powerful message . only a boycotting will sending this message sufficiently . <eos>

@highlight

<s> only boycott the olympic sufficiently protest china 's abuses . <eos>
