<s> cleared mines : is cleared mining an insufficient solution ? <eos>

<s> it is absurd to suggest that there are two separate issue about landmines : wartime use and post-conflict removal . the two are inextricably interlinked . most nations that deploy landmine including those manufactured by the united states never clear them afterwards . as demonstrated by decade of indifference on the part of nations after determined lobbyists by passionate activists it is folly to rely on goodwill or trust to remove landmines . it is simple if they are manufactured and deployed innocent people inevitably die . the usa should not dirty its hands by the trading in these wicked weapons .

<s> wartime use of landmine hampers post-war reconstruction . <eos>
