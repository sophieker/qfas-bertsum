<s> sexual role : does pornography play a constructive role in sex ? <eos>

<s> watching other people performing a sexual act can help one to fully perceive and realize the actual absurdity and emptiness of sex ( from the conscious point of view ) hereby enabling one to build-up a healthy distance from the whole issue . by watching pornography one can train sexual self-control which can come handy either during the sexual act or in the process of consciously avoiding it ( resisting seduction respecting partner 's mind ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> porn improves self-control with distance from sex . <eos>
