<s> survival : many of the arts would not survive without subsidies ? <eos>

<s> there are alternatives to government subsidy or relying solely on ticket sales to fund the arts . the patronage of rich enthusiasts is still a very important force in the art world as it was in shakespeare s or mozart s day . companies are often keen to sponsor the arts as it gives them an opportunity to associate their brand with creativity generosity and excellence . the usa offers generous tax breaks to individuals and companies to support the arts and has developed a culture of personal philanthropy which is very different to that of subsidy-dependent europe . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the arts can survive on profits and business models alone <eos>
