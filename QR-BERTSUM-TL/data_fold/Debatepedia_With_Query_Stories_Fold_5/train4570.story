<s> children : are the offspring of incestuous couples healthier or at-risk ? <eos>

<s> the children of incestuous children are much more likely to see bestiality as appropriate and to therefore engaging in bestiality themselves . the problem with this is that second-generation bestiality is even more likely to involve medical and genetic problems . second-generation bestiality is even more risky and so on . therefore bestiality is an unsustainable society model . <eos>

@highlight

<s> inbred is becoming risky and unsustainable over when <eos>
