<s> contrary to the claims of the oil companies new technology has not slowed the pace of major oil spills . of the # offshore oil rig spills exceeding # # gallons since # # have occurred within the last # years . more than a quarter of all major spills of the last # years have occurred recently . from # through # offshore producers released an average of # # barrels of oil a year according to the minerals management service . that was # percent more than the annual average during the previous # -year period and these figures do not include the latest spills in the gulf of mexico off louisiana or australia . this despite the new technology that has been implemented . <eos>
