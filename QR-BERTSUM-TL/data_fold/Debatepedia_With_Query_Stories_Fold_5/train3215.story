<s> costs : is allowing gays in the military economical ? <eos>

<s> argued in the section on talent recruiting and retention there is good evidence that there are many members of the military as well as prospective recruits that oppose gays in the military and who may leave the military or avoid enlisting if gays are allowed to serve openly . this would be very costly in dollar-terms to the military . and while some homosexuals may be lost via a ban on homosexuals and while this may be costly it can easily be argued that this is more than outweighed by the costs of losing opponents to gays in the military . <eos>
