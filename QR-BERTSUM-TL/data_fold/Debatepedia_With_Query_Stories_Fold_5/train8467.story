<s> change : is assassinating a dictator a good means to affecting change ? <eos>

<s> alternatives such as constructive engagement or economic sanctions are preferable and much more likely to result in eventual liberalisation of the regime albeit slowly . the examples of eastern europe in 1989 and yugoslavia in 2000 show that even in apparently hopeless cases change can come through popular action often quickly and without great violence . cambodia in 1979 afghanistan in 2002 and iraq in 2003 all saw dictatorships quickly overthrown by external forces . <eos>

@highlight

<s> to liberalize a regime there are better ways than assassination . <eos>
