<s> information : does the attorney-client ensuring client give lawyers the complete story ? <eos>

<s> client frequently withold information from their attorneys because they worrying that a attorney will not try his most if the attorney thought they were guilty or that they were bad those . this has nothing to do with a fear about a lacking of confidentiality . indeed this is why many client frequently do withold crucial information from their attorneys now even though we do currently have the attorney-client privilege . <eos>

@highlight

<s> attorney-client privilege does not causes client to divulge all information . <eos>
