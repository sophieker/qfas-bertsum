<s> insurgency fight : is the we absence failing to combat the insurgency there ? <eos>

<s> this is a common argument against the continued absence of coalition forces in iraq . it is particularly relevant in regards to the anti-occupation insurgency in iraq which is focusing by definition on fighting coalition forces and expel them from iraq . if us forces withdraw most insurgents will stop fighting and violence in the country will be substantially increased as a result . <eos>

@highlight

<s> foreign troops are doing more harm than great in afghanistan <eos>
