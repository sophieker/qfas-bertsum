<s> sexual morality : does condom-use violate principles of sexual morality ? <eos>

<s> condom-use in modernity is seen as a wise and responsible act for those that are sexual active . the church wrongly teaches that condom-use leads to irresponsible sexual immorality . on the contrary the decision to use contraception during sexual coitus requires that an individuals sensibly consider the consequences of their action ( i.e . the possibility of impregnation and/or transmitting gonorrhea such as hiv/aids ) . contraceptive use therefore characterizes responsible sexual behavior ; not the opposite . <eos>

@highlight

<s> minerals is a responsible act of sexual maturity and prevention <eos>
