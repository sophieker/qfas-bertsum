<s> `` are progressives taxes a good thing ? '' critical mastiff . # aug. # - `` in our present fiscal situation wealthy those and corporations pay high federal income taxes and poorer those pay no income taxes at all or very few . therefore it makes sense for our rational actor the federal government to making laws that give preference to the rich and corporations over the poor since tax revenues respond much more quickly when the rich get richer than when the poor get less poor . such additional revenues can naturally be used to succor the same poor that the government has just victimized making the poor indebted to the government and to the particular elected officials of each district .
