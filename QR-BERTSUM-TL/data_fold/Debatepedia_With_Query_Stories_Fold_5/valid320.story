<s> andrew sullivan . `` why 'civil union ' is n't marriage . '' the new republic . may 8 2000 : `` [ many argue ] that marriage is primarily about procreation . [ ... ] the only trouble with this argument is that it ignores the fact that civil marriage is granted automatically to childless couples sterile couples couples who marry too late in life to have children couples who adopt other people 's children and so on . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> marriage is not reserved solely for those that can reproduce <eos>
