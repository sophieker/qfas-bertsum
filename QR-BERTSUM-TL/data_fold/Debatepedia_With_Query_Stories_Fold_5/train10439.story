<s> birth control : is abortion an important safety net to birth control ? is it an alternative ? <eos>

<s> if a woman does not voluntarily choose to seek a pregnancy it is impossible for a fetus to have any claim over the woman 's body . only when the woman participates voluntarily in creating a life does she open the door to any responsibilities to the fetus or to any rights that the fetus may have over the mother . if a pregnancy is a result of an accident ( the failure of birth control ) it can not be called voluntary . therefore the fetus can not be said to have any rights over the mother 's body and abortion can be said to be justified . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortion is just when birth control fails ( involuntary impregnation ) <eos>
