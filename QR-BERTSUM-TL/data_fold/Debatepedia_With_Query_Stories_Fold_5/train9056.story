<s> crime fighting : are crime cameras helpful in fighting crime ? <eos>

<s> jim harper the director of information policy studies at the cato institute was quoted saying in a july 2007 abc article : `` they are good forensic tools after something happens they 'll tell you what happened . [ ... ] but they do not provide protection against attacks and that 's a key distinction . '' [ 2 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> crime cameras may help prosecutions but do n't reduce crime . <eos>
