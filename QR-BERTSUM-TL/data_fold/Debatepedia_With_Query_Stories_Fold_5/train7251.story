<s> ethnicity : do the s. ossetian 's have a distinct national identity ? <eos>

<s> even if s. ossetians are a distinct people with a distinct claim to nationhood is n't this actually a good reason for them to stay within georgia . this would expose both ethnic s. ossetians and georgians to greater diversity . while the principle of self-determination has value so do these other counter-veiling principle . <eos>

@highlight

<s> s. ossetia should stay with georgia to foster strength through diversity . <eos>
