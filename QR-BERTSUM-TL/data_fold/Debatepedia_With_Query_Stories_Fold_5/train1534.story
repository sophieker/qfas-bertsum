<s> last resort : is corporal punishments justified as `` a last resort '' ? <eos>

<s> laurie e. couture . `` # pro-corporal punishment arguments & # commonsense answers '' . # : `` argument # : 'i only use corporal punishment as a last resort . ' answer : this rational teaches children that it is acceptable to use violence as a last resort to getting their way or to solving a difficult problem . this teaches that violence is the end result to frustrating situations that seem to have no other solution . wars are fought on this principle . this argument is no more acceptable than an angry spouses saying that they `` only '' hit their mate `` as a last resort '' to a problem . '' <eos>
