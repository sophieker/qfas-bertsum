<s> safety : do vuvuzelas present a security threat in stadiums ? <eos>

<s> if someone wants to inflict violence on others at games they can sneak in a knife start a fight and/or initiate a deadly stampede . the idea that a light-weight plastic horn could be a greater threat than these things is an absolute joke . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vuvuzelas are the least of safety concerns in stadiums . <eos>
