<s> vs. `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia better than withdrawing life supporting ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> the terri shiavo case is illustrative of the situation created by the illegality of euthanasia . a choice was made that terri shiavo 's death was imminent and that should should be permitted to die . without the option of euthanasia her feeding tubes were removed and she was starving to death . how is that more morality than euthanasia ? forced patients to starving to death or go into cardiac arrested simply because the option of euthanasia does not exist is a cruel alternative . <eos>

@highlight

<s> remove life support causes an excruciating death ; euthanasia is more humane <eos>
