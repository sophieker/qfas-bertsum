<s> is payment of income tax required by us law ? <eos>

<s> needs the phrase `` income '' is not define but once in the irs tax code and if we refer to the definition of `` income '' as define by the constitution we find that it is actually define as `` profit '' or `` gains `` not compensation for labor which as the_divine_mrs_m pointed out is actually more of a bartered than a profit . <eos>

@highlight

<s> income is not defined clearly in us tax code or constitution . <eos>
