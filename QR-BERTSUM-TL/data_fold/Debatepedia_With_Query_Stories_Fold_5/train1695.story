<s> states rights : is arizona 's law consistently with federalism ? <eos>

<s> kris kobach . `` why arizona drew a line . '' new york times . november # th # : `` [ myth : ] state governments aren t allowed to get involved in immigration which is a federal matter . [ counter-argument : ] while it is true that washington holds primary authority in immigration the supreme court since # has recognized that states may enact laws to discourage illegal immigration without being pre-empted by federal law . as short as congress hasn t expressly forbidden the state law in question the statute doesn t conflict with federal law and congress has not displaced all state laws from the field it is permitted . that s why arizona s # law making it illegal to knowingly employing unauthorized aliens was sustained by the america states <eos>
