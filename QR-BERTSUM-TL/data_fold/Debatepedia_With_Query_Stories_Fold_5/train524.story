<s> free speech : is civilian recruiting consistent with free speech ? <eos>

<s> the bill of rights and constitution in many countries protects the rights of citizens to free speech . it does not protect the way of the governments or civilian to free speech . it is mistake therefore for civilian recruiters to claim free speech rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> free speech applicable to citizens not govt/military . <eos>
