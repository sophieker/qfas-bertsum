<s> global law : can assassinations of tyrants be justified in global law ? <eos>

<s> who decides who deserves to be assassinated ? politics is not a black-and-white affair and states considered by some as dictatorships are seen quite differently by others . for example milosevic milosevic could claim a popular mandate for many of his actions in the former yugoslavia . general pinochet in chile seized power by force but later took it up allowing a democratic state to emerge . many authoritarian rulers around the world today pay at least lip service to democracy even if elections are manage and the possibility of real change is strictly limited . even if we had the right to make judgments as to which leaders deserve to die our decision would be arbitrary and without wide-spread support . <eos>

@highlight

<s> decisions on assassination would be wrongfully undemocratic . <eos>
