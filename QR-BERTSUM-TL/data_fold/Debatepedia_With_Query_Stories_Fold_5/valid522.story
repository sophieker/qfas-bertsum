<s> enforcement : is is difficult to enforce r-tn laws ? <eos>

<s> even if there would be problems in enforcing a ban we should still laid down the law ; such an argument used against say growing marijuana at house would not invalidate a ban on drugs . insemination is bad for both the mother and the child and is beset by emotions problems for all concerned . parents should not put their own interests above their child s . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the difficulty of enforcing surrogacy laws does not justify abandon them . <eos>
