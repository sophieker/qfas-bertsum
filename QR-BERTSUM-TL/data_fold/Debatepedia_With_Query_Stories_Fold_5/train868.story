<s> harm : is the wearing of the muslim veil harmful ? <eos>

<s> this may sounds silly but it is a fact that quite a large number of french people actually have something called 'islamophobia ' and are afraid of muslim people . this probably sounds ridiculous but it is a fact . the french government has had this ban in place since the mid- # s and there is a lots of controversy around it . the central reason for this ban of the muslim veils is that a lots of french people do have islamophobia and the french government dealt with the problem . this means that a ) french people wo n't know who follows islam and b ) french people with islamophobia wo n't be afraid of them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> french people have islamophobia ; ban on veils softens this problem . <eos>
