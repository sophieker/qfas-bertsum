<s> associations : does unlimited spending foster right to speech in assoc . ? <eos>

<s> the constitutional law scholar laurence h. tribe : `` talking about a business corporation as merely another way that individuals might choose to organize their association with one another to pursue their common expressive aims is worse than unrealistic ; it obscures the very real injustice and distortion entailed in the phenomenon of some people using other people s money to support candidates they have made no decision to support or to oppose candidates they have made no decision to oppose . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> corporations are no form of free association/speech <eos>
