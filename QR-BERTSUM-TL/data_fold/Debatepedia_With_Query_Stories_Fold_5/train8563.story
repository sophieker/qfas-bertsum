<s> homosexuals : do gays and lesbians need hate crimes protections ? <eos>

<s> this is particularly truth in regard to the expression of religious opposition to homosexual in which a preacher 's public statements against homosexual might be interpreted as incitements to violence against homosexuals . while it is important to considering whether homosexuals need protections it is also required to considering the cost of these laws to religious free speech . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hate crime laws violate religious free speeches <eos>
