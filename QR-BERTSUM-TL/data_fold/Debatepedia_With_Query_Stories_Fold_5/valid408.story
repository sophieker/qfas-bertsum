<s> politics : does ( and should ) the vox populi matter ? <eos>

<s> such devices as referenda or initiatives are intended not to bring government closer to the people but to giving undemocratic government a veneer of democratic respectability . real power is but with the elites who decide who will stand for which seat and thus who is guaranteed to be elected via safe seats . in britain we even have an undemocratic second chambers the house of lords which is able to interfere substantially with the process of passing laws . these lords are appointed directly by the political parties . true democracy we repeat again is an unworkable system on the scale of a country and we should abandon pretences at it for a more practical system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democratic is just an illusion . <eos>
