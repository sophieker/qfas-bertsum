<s> taxes rebate : is the proposed taxes rebate a good idea ? <eos>

<s> tax rebates are a cash give-away . there is nothing in them that increases incentives for workers to be more productive ; whether they work harder or not they will but be receiving the same tax rebate . tax-cuts on the other hands incentivizing increased productivity by creating a dynamic in which if workers put in more hour and earn more cash they will be can to keep more of that cash instead of paying it away in taxes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> taxes rebate do n't encouraging wealth production <eos>
