<s> discipline : is smacking effective discipline for a child ? <eos>

<s> in germany where the law on smacking was modified in 2000 smacking has declined and there has been a reported rise in disciplinary methods like television bans and reduced pocket money . a ban on smacking would provide a clear legal basis for the promotion of similar positive non-violent forms of discipline which reduce family stress and promote polite children . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there are more effective disciplinary techniques . <eos>
