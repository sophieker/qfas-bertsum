<s> personality : does debate affect people 's behavior in a positive way ? <eos>

<s> sadly debate tournaments can be also seen as an opportunity to get drunk with one s friends because parents are far away - and tournament s organizers do not ( usually ) care . worse still peer pressure causes even younger children to join such `` parties '' which is clearly harmful for their health and personal values . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debate tournaments are not just about debating . <eos>
