<s> emissions/global warming : are electric cars helpful in fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> regenerative braking systems generate and store electricity from the action of braking a car . instead of break pads slowing a vehicle and converting the lost energy into kinetic heat energy regenerative braking systems slow the car via a generator that converts momentum into electricity . this electricity can help re-charge the battery of an electric vehicle . these systems increase the energy efficiency of electric cars which is very important to lowering emissions and fighting global warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> electric cars can be combined with regenerative braking . <eos>
