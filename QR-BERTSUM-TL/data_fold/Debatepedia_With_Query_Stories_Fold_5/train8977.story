<s> xenophobia : were the jyllands-posten cartoons tolerant or xenophobic ? <eos>

<s> on february # the cartoonist who had draw the `` bomb in turban '' picture the most controversial of the twelve explained : there are interpretations of it [ the drawing ] that are incorrect . the general impression among muslims is that it is about islam as a whole . it is not . it is about certain fundamentalist aspects that of course are not shared by everyone . but the fuel for the terrorists acts stem from interpretations of islam . [ ... ] if repair of a religion develop in a totalitarian and aggressive direction then i think you have to protest . we did so under the other 'isms . <eos>

<s> the `` bomb in turban '' cartoon was aimed at extremists not muslim generally . <eos>
