<s> trade : does asean promote i-trade ? is this a good thing ? <eos>

<s> asean replaces the traditional narrow-minded nationalist vision with a regionalist closed-mind mentality . they may also offer a false sense of participation in the international economic sphere when the great leap to world trade is at last a possibility . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unions such as asean encourage their members to turn inwards instead of adopt the better principles of globalization : <eos>
