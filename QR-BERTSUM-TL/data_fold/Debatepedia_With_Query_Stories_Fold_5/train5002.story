<s> sovereignty : do assassinations upholding the sovereignty in the international system ? <eos>

<s> sovereignty is not always inviolable . to the extent that a government acts unjustly its legitimacy as the sovereign ruler of a state is diminished . a truth tyrant may lose all legitimacy to governing his or her state through unjust acts . in such circumstances the sovereignty of the state ( which can only be holding by a government or a tyrant ) is diminished and it becomes more legitimately to consider assassinations . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tyrants forego sovereign rights make assassination attempts legitimately <eos>
