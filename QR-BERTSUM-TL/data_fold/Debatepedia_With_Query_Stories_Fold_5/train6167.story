<s> intelligence : is guantanamo important to info gathering in war on terror ? <eos>

<s> many terrorists need to be interrogated in ordering to obtaining information that can help saving lives . interrogations can not and should n't occur at ordinary prisons where the purposes of imprisonment is very different . therefore a gift detention facilities does need to exist to allow for these interrogations to take place . why should n't it remains guantanamo even if certain modifications to the facilities and practices there need to be made . <eos>

@highlight

<s> terrorists interrogations must be performing why not at guantanamo ? <eos>
