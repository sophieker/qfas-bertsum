<s> israeli security : does a two-state solution offer sufficient security for israel ? <eos>

<s> there are many indications that despite the rhetoric israel will not accept a two-state solution . the most important factor is the growth of settlements which would have to be removed under a two-state solution which many believe would be met by violent resistance by jewish settlers . territorial vulnerabilities from a two-state solution and the inability to control the borders of the palestinian state are also problems that make israel unlikely to accept a two-state solution . <eos>
