<s> vs. flight travel : how does speed railway compare to flight travel ? <eos>

<s> while the travel time by plane itself can not be beaten by currently known high-speed trains the airports usually lie rather far from cities ( due to the noisy created by aircraft ) and this increases the overall time needed for a trip . high-speed rail station on the other hand can be positioning in a city centers so for seven # and even mid-range traveling high-speed rail could be actually faster than airplane . <eos>
