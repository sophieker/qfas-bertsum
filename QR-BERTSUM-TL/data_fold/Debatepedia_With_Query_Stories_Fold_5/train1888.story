<s> should hate speech be censored for the good of society ? <eos>

<s> when someone declares that all arabs should be shot ? when they say something politically insensitive like `` mohammed lied to all the moslems ; there are only # virgins '' or `` jesus was gay '' or `` communism only works in chinese because the chinese work so hard '' ? or perhaps when that piece of media is critical of the particular government ? the media should not be restricted from presenting an opinion . if someone decides to spout some ridiculous ideas then they can easily be disproved by others . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we do n't know where should the line be drawn with such a pieces of legislation . <eos>
