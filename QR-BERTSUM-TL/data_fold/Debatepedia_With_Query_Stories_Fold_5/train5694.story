<s> surrender : was bombing japan necessary in getting them to surrender ? <eos>

<s> historian tsuyoshi hasegawa 's research has led him to conclude that the atomic bombings themselves were not even the principal reason for capitulation . instead he contends it was the swift and devastating soviet victories in manchuria that forced the japanese surrender on august 15 1945 though the war council did not know the extent of the losses to the soviets in china at that time . <eos>

<s> soviet victories in manchuria were core cause of japanese surrender . <eos>
