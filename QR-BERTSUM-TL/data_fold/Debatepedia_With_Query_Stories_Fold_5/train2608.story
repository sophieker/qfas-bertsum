<s> database : would a centralized databases be a good idea ? <eos>

<s> it is important to recognize that this is not a choice between a government-run database and no database . the alternative to a government-run health care database is only a privately owned health care databases . with these choices in mind it is better that health care info be held by the government than by less-productive companies . the government is better able to protect the confidentiality of individuals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> roos of database better protect privacy than companies . <eos>
