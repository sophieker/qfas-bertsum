<s> feasibility : is a missions to mars than technologically feasible ? <eos>

<s> during the `` space race '' in the # s and # s the we ( as but as other countries ) had to start from scratch . anything about space habitation transportation or interaction has been put together of any sort . nasa had a system to allow for a continuous progressing of space knowledge with the mercury gemini and then apollo missions . this progressive system allowed for the adaptation and streamline of the process of eventually landing on the moon . <eos>

@highlight

<s> small tech leap were made for lunar mission why not for mars ? <eos>
