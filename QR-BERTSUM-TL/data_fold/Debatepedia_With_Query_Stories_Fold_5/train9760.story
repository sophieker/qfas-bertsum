<s> enforcement : is it difficult to effectively regulate file-sharing and any law against it ? <eos>

<s> while it may be impossible to detect each single download from the internet that does not mean that we should stop . for example lawsuits can be brought against both companies and persons engaged in illegal filesharing . the argument that because we can t do it perfectly we shouldn t try at all is ridiculous as we could then stop trying to catch pirates that burn cds or tape videos and then sell them on a large scale .

<s> difficulties of enforcement do not mean we should abandon copyright laws . <eos>
