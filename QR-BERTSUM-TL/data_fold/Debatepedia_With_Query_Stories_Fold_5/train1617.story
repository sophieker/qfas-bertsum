'' -- `` the fact is that in many many public schools kids with disabilities are not teaching to read and do math while the vast majority of them can master these skills with proper instruction . [ ... ] no child left behind will short-circuit all of the excuses and explanations . school systems that do a great job with children with disabilities will show their progressing and those that fail to do a great job will have their ineffectiveness exposed . then parents and voters can make informed decisions about how to get the underachievers on track .
