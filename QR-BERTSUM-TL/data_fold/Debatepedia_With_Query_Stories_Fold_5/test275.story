<s> male preferences : do females prefer circumcised penises ? <eos>

<s> `` circumcision alters sexual function '' . national organization of circumcision information . opposing views - `` the movements and skin please an intact woman needs to reaching orgasm are compatible with the movements and skin please a woman needs to reaching orgasm . the dryness abrasion and chafing complaints of some women along with their inability to have an orgasm are invariably complications of circumcision . a circumcised male has little lubrication of his own and he removes much of a woman 's vaginal lubrication with every outstroke . in addition a circumcised male needs longer strokes to stimulate the small sensitive area ( frenular remnant ) on the underneath of his penis to reaching ejaculation . each long outstroke distances him from the woman 's clitoris making it harder for her <eos>
