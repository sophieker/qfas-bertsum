<s> demographics : could such a policy avoid demographic problems ? <eos>

<s> if a state s population became seriously unbalanced one might have to rethink : but given that most countries including all in the west do not and given that many families in most countries will choose to have roughly as many of the other sex this should not stop this proposal being putting into effect in many countries . even in china the problem is largely due to the `` one-child '' policy which has been relaxed in many areas since the mid- # s . over time a scarcity of one gender will in any case producing newest pressures to imbalances the population e.g the paying of dowries may change women will achieve higher status . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gender selections will not result in demographic imbalances . <eos>
