<s> geography : do the falklands belong to argentina on the basis of geography ? <eos>

<s> the malvinas are closer to argentina than any other country in the world ( # miles ) . they are however on the other side of the earth from britain ( # miles away ) . modern nation states should not have territorial claims on the other side of the earth particularly when a modern nation state directly adjacent to the territory under consideration claims the territory . in this sense of the relative distance of the malvinas islands from britain and argentina britain 's claim to the islands is reminiscent of britain 's colonial past is wrong and should be ended . <eos>
