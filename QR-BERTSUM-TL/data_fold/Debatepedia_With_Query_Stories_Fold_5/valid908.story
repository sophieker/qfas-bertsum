<s> public anxiety : would castration help relax public anxieties ? <eos>

<s> at the moment there is a massive stigmatisation of sexual offenders with them being named and shamed publicly ( for example by the news of the world newspaper in britain in the summer of # ) and hounded off their estates by mobs ( as can be seen from the events after the news of the world campaign ) . they are also subject to a large amount of violence in prison from other inmates . if castration is introduced the public would know that these people are no longer a threat and they would be allowed to get on with their lives . castration removes both the public stigmatisation and personal suffering of sexual offenders and should be embraced by the penal system . <eos>
