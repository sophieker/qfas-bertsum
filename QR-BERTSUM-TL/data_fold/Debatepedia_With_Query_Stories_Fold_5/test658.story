<s> economics : is labeling gm foods economically sound ? <eos>

<s> labeling of genetically modification foods costs money . it is not free . it requires that all companies be regulated that they ensuring that they have or do not have a certain level of gm ingredients in their foods and that labels be placed on these food products . this would be very expensive . this would harm prices jobs salaries and overall economic health . it would also probably requiring an increase in tax to fund new regulatory body for gm foods . <eos>
