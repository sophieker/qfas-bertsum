<s> democracy process : do earmarks strengthen the democracy process ? <eos>

<s> earmarks often have anything to do with the actual substance of a pieces of legislation relating to something anything entirely . this creates many problems . the most important problem is that votes on a pieces of legislation may have anything to do with whether a member of congress support a particular earmark found within . this means that earmarks may pass that have virtually no supporting of senator and their constituents virtually attaching the earmarks from the democracy process either . <eos>

@highlight

<s> earmarks are sometimes unrelated to legislation ; undemocratic . <eos>
