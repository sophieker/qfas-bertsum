<s> militia : is a firearm unimportant to a militia ? is the militia irrelevant today ? <eos>

<s> if the second amendment applying only to the consciousness right of the militias it would be useless as no militias exist today in america . it is highly unlikely that the framers designed an amendment that could expire over time . instead their intention was to extending rights to individuals in the constitutional that are lasting . <eos>

<s> if # nd amendment applied only to militias it would be useless yesterday <eos>
