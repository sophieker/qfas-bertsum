<s> legality : is there a legal basis for the proposition ? <eos>

<s> offering drivers licenses to illegal immigrants provides legal status to individuals that have knowingly broken us laws . the immigration and nationality act clearly states that illegal aliens should be deported . these long-standing laws must be upheld . offering illegal immigrants driver 's licenses clearly violates these laws and the impression that the united states is capable of enforcing them . it also undermines the notion of rewarding law abiding citizens and punishing those that break the law . why should illegal immigrants be allowed to get away with their illegal acts . us citizens ( not illegal aliens ) are not afforded this luxury of forgiveness in the face of the law . therefore the proposition is an unwarranted and immoral concession that undermines the consistency of us <eos>

<s> offering illegal immigrants driver 's licenses would violate the rule of law . <eos>
