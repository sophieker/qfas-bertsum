<s> the three gorges dam exists on a major fault line . a major earthquake in the area could cause the dam to collapse leading to thousands of casualties costing billions of dollars and proving counter-productive to its objective . in addition the massive reservoir building up behind the three gorges dam increased pressure on the earth and may elevate the risk of an earthquake in the area . <eos>
