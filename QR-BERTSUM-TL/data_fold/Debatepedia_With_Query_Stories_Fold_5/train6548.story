<s> crime/violence : does the war on drugs help reduce crime/violence ? <eos>

<s> experts like andreas von b low and milton friedman concede that almost every serious crime of terrorism is funded by illegal drugs but they do n't agree that prohibition can reduce these phenomena . in fact the prohibition protects the drug cartel insofar as it keeps the distribution in the black market and creates the risk that makes smuggling profitable . as former federal narcotics officer michael levine states in relation to his undercover work with colombian cocaine cartels .
