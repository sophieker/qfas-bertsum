<s> are the regulations of what you can take onboard aircraft too strict ? <eos>

<s> the security regulations and restrictions may be fussy and possibly annoying to people both innocent and guilty of terrorism but it is necessary . the restrictions are certainly not too strict and with just one less restriction in place that could allow a terrorist attack . nobody wants to die in a terrorist attack but without these restrictions terrorism could increase and get dangerously out of control . <eos>

@highlight

<s> terrorism is a major problem and must not happen . <eos>
