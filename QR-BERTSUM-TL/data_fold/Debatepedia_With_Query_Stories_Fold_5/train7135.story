<s> societal safety/health : does plea bargaining in exchange for testimony failing to protecting society ? <eos>

<s> - social ends should not guide the administration of the law . it is not acceptable to sacrifice the due implementation of the law against one criminal in order to convict a worse criminal . this is a classic example of justifying means by ends . the problem is that this leads to a slippery slope of ends justifying means . should a criminal be set free because he is a genius and may be useful to society ? should torture be justified because it could save more life than it takes ? when social ends justify means these are the kinds of answers that arise . <eos>

@highlight

<s> attempting to capture a bigger criminal through a plea-bargain-exchange-for-testimony wrongly justifies meaning by end <eos>
