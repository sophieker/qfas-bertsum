<s> vs. nuclear : should tidal energy substitute for nuclear energy ? <eos>

<s> tidal energy is incapable of producing electricity on a large global scale due to its low capacity factor ( 0-production when tides are n't moving ) and because it is viable in a very limited number of sites . nuclear energy on the other hand is capable of scaling to produce massive quantities of electricity . it currently supplies around 20 % of all electricity demand in the united states and could supply the majority of electricity demand if more nuclear energy plants were constructed in the united states . for these reason tidal energy is incapable of replacing nuclear energy as a fuel source . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tidal energy ca n't produce enough electricity to replace nuclear . <eos>
