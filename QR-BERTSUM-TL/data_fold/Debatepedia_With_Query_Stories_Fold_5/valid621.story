<s> economics : is direct democracy always desirable ? <eos>

<s> direct democracy works on a small system . for example the athenian democracy governed a city of at its height about 30 000 eligible voters ( free adult male citizens . ) town meetings a form of local government once common in new england has also worked well often emphasizing consensus over majority rule . the use of direct democracy on a larger scale has historically been more difficult however . it requires intricate communication and information-campaigns all which are expensive complicated and prone to break-downs of various kinds . <eos>

<s> direct democracy generally only works on a small scale . <eos>
