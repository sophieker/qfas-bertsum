<s> `` the case against vouchers '' . national education association : `` a pure voucher system would only encourage economic racial ethnic and religious stratification in our society . america 's success has been built on our ability to unify our diverse populations . '' the terms logic for this is that vouchers would often be used by parents and students to attending schools with minded students whether black hispanic christian or disabled . they therefore allow for the separating of groups and the problems of misunderstandings and division that follow as a result . <eos>
