<s> walter williams . `` making a cases for corporal punishment '' . bnet . sept # # : `` during my youth i might have been doing something mischievous such as throwing stones . an adult would come over to me and ask 'does your mother know you 're out here throwing stones ? ' i 'd reply 'no ma'am or no sir ' and hope that the matter ended there . [ ... ] today it 's very different . an adult correcting a youngster risks being cursed and possibly assaulted . that 's a sad commentary . adults are justifiably afraid of children . do we americans as parents teachers principals and others in positions of authority have the guts and willpower to control our youngsters ?
