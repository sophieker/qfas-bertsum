<s> cruel ? is factory farming cruel ? <eos>

<s> certainly no more than in traditional forms of farming which is the correct comparison to make ( rather than thinking of a ban in a standalone sense ) since food will still have to be produced in one way or another . foie gras has been produced since time immemorial by the force feeding of geese . animals have always been herded together confined branded killed and eaten . this is not the fault of the modern intensive ( or factory ) industry it s just the way things are when people eat meat . furthermore the large firms responsible for factory farming are more easily monitored by law so the animals often fare better than they would have done in normal farming so it s not <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is very little cruelty or suffering in factory farming . <eos>
