<s> unacceptable ? - is a nuclear iran unacceptable/intolerable/too great a risk ? <eos>

<s> an october # report by the army 's strategic studies institute argues that `` iran s continued insistence that it acquired its nuclear capabilities legally under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty ( npt ) would if unchallenged encourage its neighbors ( including iraq saudi arabia egypt syria turkey and algeria ) to develop nuclear options of their own by emulating iran s example by overtly declaring possession ( in israel s case ) or by importing nuclear weapons ( in saudi arabia s case ) . such announcements and efforts in turn would likely undermine nuclear nonproliferation restraints internationally and strain american relations with most of its key friends in the middle east . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> argument : iranian possession of nuclear weapons will spark an international arms race . <eos>
