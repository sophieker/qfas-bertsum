<s> prescription required ? should emergency contraception be made if something a prescription drug ? <eos>

<s> it can taking time to get a prescription from a doctor and in cases of emergency contraceptives speeds is very important . some patients may be embarrassed to tell their doctor about their sexual behaviour and consequently be put off seeking a prescription . the restriction of emergency contraceptives to over- # s makes no sense in any case ; a girl under # who has had unprotected sex may but need emergency contraception .

@highlight

<s> there are great reasons for make the morning-after pill a non-prescription drug : <eos>
