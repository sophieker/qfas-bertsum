<s> economics : would private ownership of water be more economical than a global commons ? <eos>

<s> - for-profit water companies sell water at a price per gallon . there is a direct incentive for them to sell as many gallons of water as is possible . therefore there is no inherent incentive for them to conserve water resources . this has implications in regards to the environment but also the economy . if water becomes highly scarce for example because water companies are pumping as fast and as much of it as possible then this may force a major spike in water prices creating economic shocks . we can not trust profit-interests to manage scarce water resources appropriately to avoid such problems ; government management is necessary that has the public interest more directly at heart . <eos>

<s> water privatization is at odds with the need to conserve water resources <eos>
