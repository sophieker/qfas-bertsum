<s> everybody has the authority to take the life of another individual . nor do they have the authority to euthanize an individual . and if a doctor or family merely provides the poison they can nevertheless be seen like co-conspirators to a crime . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nobody has the right to taking another 's life including with euthanasia <eos>
