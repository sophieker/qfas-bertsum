<s> armenian `` genocide '' : is turkey 's alleged genocide of armenians irrelevant ? <eos>

<s> it is fundamentally wrong to admit a country that directly violates laws of a substantial numbers of european states ( in germany denying genocide is illegal ) the more if it concerns such a sensitive issue . denying genocide is immoral because a ) it shows selfish interest for how a country/government is viewed by its people ( instead of how it is perceived by global actors ) b ) it comes against the principle `` never again '' c ) it denies responsibilty and d ) it tries to rewrite historical instead of drawing lessons from it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> admitted turkey undermines european values . <eos>
