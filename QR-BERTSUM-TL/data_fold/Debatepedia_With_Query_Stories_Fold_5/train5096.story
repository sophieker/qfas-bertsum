<s> economics : can the la have a greater impact on poverty than climate change ? <eos>

<s> climate change is almost certain to occur considering current and projections emissions level and the general trend in temperature increases and glacial melt . in addition it seems likely that even if emissions rates are slowed all available fossil fuels will eventually be burned and the contained carbon released into the atmosphere . therefore even if climate change were the `` greater crisis '' it is irrelevant because nothing can be done to stopping it . it is better that the un focus its concern and limited resources on issues it can affect such as poverty where there is a bigger bang-for-buck and lower risks of wasting billions of dollars on a lost cause . <eos>

<s> warming changing may be inevitable while poverty can be stopped . <eos>
