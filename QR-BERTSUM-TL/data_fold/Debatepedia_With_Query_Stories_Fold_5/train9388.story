<s> trends ? are islamic countries trends out from democracy ? <eos>

<s> there is bit findings of repeated elections without restrictions or of the accountability of institutions to the electorate ; nor are there guarantees of freedom of expression . elections rarely take place and even when they do for example in iranian the theocratic authorities may have the ability to vetoed any party or individual on the grounds of incompatible with doctrine . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the basic features of democratic rule are absent from the muslim world . <eos>
