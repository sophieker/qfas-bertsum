<s> rights : do children have the same rights as adults ? <eos>

<s> children should receive the same legal protection from violent as boys . it is wrong that parents can deliberately inflict pain to the extent that if inflicted on an adult it would justify prosecution . in a number of nations including the united kingdom children are the most vulnerable members of society yet the only groups which can be legally assaulted . <eos>

@highlight

<s> child deserves the same liberties as everyone else . <eos>
