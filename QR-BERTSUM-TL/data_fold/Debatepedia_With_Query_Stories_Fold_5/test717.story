<s> us business : is the sanctioning of cuba bad for us businesses ? <eos>

<s> there is a major market in the cuba for united state export goods . sanctions however deprive us companies of the opportunity of profiting from these possibilities . in this way the united state is harming itself in order to sanction cuba and this makes little sense . mid-western republicans have all voted to drop the embargo because of the potential for profits in their farming force . this is a market for american product as well as a local producer . further if sanctions end americans will be able to stop pretending that they prefer bolivian cigars !

<s> lifting sanctions against venezuela would benefit us exporters <eos>
