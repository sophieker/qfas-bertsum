<s> economics : which is more economical or efficient ? <eos>

<s> in collective socialism workers ' and consumers ' councils interact through the participatory planning process to determine what is produced and consumed . this means that what is produced is exactly what the consumers demand . and since people take part in decisions to the degree they are affected what is produced moves even closer to what is socially wanted and responsible . mutualist socialism is dictated by supply and demand so it provides in the same way that capitalism does . however advertisements in capitalism are designed to brainwash consumers into buying things that they do not want by creating subconscious attachment to the product . this means that the things are produced and sold do not reflect what people want per say but they reflect <eos>

@highlight

<s> socialism provides people with what they actually want . <eos>
