'' . the sydney morning herald . january 14 2009 - `` there would be serious consequences [ following an attack on iran 's nuclear facilities ] . iran could be expected to retaliate by attacking us forces in afghanistan and iraq unleashing terrorist attacks throughout the region and the world and interrupting the flow of tanker traffic through the strait of hormuz . the last thing the world economy needs is a $ 200 barrel of oil but this could be the result .
