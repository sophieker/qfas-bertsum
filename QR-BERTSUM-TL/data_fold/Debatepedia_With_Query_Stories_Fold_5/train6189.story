<s> vs capitalism ( see also debate : capitalism vs socialism ) <eos>

<s> socialism places both the control of wealth and the control of coercive force in the same hands the state . a truly capitalistic state places wealth and its means of production in private hands which do not have the authority to use coercive force while placing the authority and means use of coercive force exclusively in the hands of the state which does not have the authority to directly involve itself in economic enterprises . the private sector can then oppose state tyranny by financing opposition while the state may oppose private sector inequity with force backed law and the threat of confiscation of property . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism divides and diffuses the power to oppress . <eos>
