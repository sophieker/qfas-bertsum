<s> demolishing dams : is it a worse idea to demolish dams ? <eos>

<s> the silt built up behind dams will not simply wash down a river when a dam is demolished . instead the silt will distribute itself more slowly along the river changing and but damaging the wetlands zone ecosystem there . the article `` tales of the undamned '' document this problem . while this may be seeing as a cost of building dams in the first places it should also be seeing to negate the main argument for demolishing dams : that it will somehow improve the environment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> demolish dams does not causes rivers to returns to normal . <eos>
