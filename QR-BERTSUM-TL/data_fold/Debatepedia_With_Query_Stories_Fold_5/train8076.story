<s> should all children be educated through the public school system ? <eos>

<s> john taylor gatto `` government schooling is the most radical adventure in history . it kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents . the whole blueprint of school procedure is egyptian not greek or roman . it grows from the theological idea that human value is a scarce thing represented symbolically by the narrow peak of a pyramid . '' <eos>

<s> public schooling ruins childhood <eos>
