<s> crime : does stringent gun-control decrease violence and crime ? <eos>

<s> the argument that people kill people and not guns is ignoring the issue presented and that is the danger of guns . guns make it easier to kill people than other means . no criminal in their right mind would try to rob a bank with a knife . guns allow for flexibility in various cases . they allow shooting from a distance in secrecy and if you are physically at a disadvantage it is even easier to take someone down . <eos>

@highlight

<s> registered guns can often be accessed by non-registered individuals <eos>
