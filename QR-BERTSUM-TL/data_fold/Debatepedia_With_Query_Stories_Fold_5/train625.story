<s> safety : are abortion safe ? what about law versus illegally abortions ? <eos>

<s> if by 'safe ' you mean that a lady can survive then the answer is possibly . a lady can have even multiple abortions and live through each . but if by 'safe ' you mean that she will experience no physical emotional or psychological harm then the answer is no . she will spent the rest of her life dealing with the myriad of consequences of the abortion by constantly shoving the rattling skeletons back into the closet . and will daily seek expiation or seek to justifying herself . in any case none of these leaves a lady 'safe ' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortions are psychologically and emotionally unsafe . <eos>
