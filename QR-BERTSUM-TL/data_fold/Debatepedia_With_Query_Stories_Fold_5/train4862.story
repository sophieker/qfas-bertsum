<s> authority : do unelected judges lack the sufficient authority and legitimacy ? <eos>

<s> `` how did we come to elect judges ? '' . frontline . 1999 : `` i think [ judicial election ] also creates a new way to nullify a judge 's decision ; if a losing party to a case can show that a judge received a significant contribution from anyone even associated with the winning party the losing party can point to this decision to demand a new trial . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> rulings of elected judges are weakened by concerns of bias <eos>
