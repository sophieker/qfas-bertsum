<s> costs effectiveness : are mercenaries costs effectiveness in conflicts ? <eos>

<s> although expensive to hiring the governments does not have to cover the cost of training housing pensions or healthcare . mercenaries unlike regular troops are only paid for the weeks on which they are used . civilian commanders can economise by reducing the size of standing armies and outsourcing roles to mercenaries as required . for example the us army is around a fourth smaller than it was in the # gulf war . this saves taxpayers money and avoids the build up of conventional troops which in the past has contributed to the development of arms races .
