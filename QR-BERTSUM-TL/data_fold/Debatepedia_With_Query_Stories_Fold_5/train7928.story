<s> separation of powers : is the program consistent with the constitution 's `` separation of powers '' ? <eos>

<s> ** according to wikipedia this point was raised against the nsa program by a group of fourteen constitutional law scholars including the dean of yale law school and the former deans of stanford law school and the university of chicago law school - `` the argument that conduct undertaken by the commander in chief that has some relevance to 'engaging the enemy ' is immune from congressional regulation finds no support in and is directly contradicted by both case law and historical precedent . every time the supreme court has confronted a statute limiting the commander-in-chief s authority it has upheld the statute . no precedent holds that the president when acting as commander in chief is free to disregard an act of congress <eos>

<s> no court precedent supports president bush 's theory that fisa impedes on the executive 's `` inherent powers '' . <eos>
