<s> economics : is libertarianism economically beneficial ? <eos>

<s> paul krugman - `` because economics touches so much of life everyone wants to have an opinion . yet the kind of economics covered in the textbooks is a technical subject that many people find hard to follow . how reassuring then to be told that it is all irrelevant -- that all you really need to know are a few simple ideas ! quite a few supply-siders have created for themselves a wonderful alternative intellectual history in which john maynard keynes was a fraud paul samuelson and even milton friedman are fools and the true line of deep economic thought runs from adam smith through obscure turn-of-the-century austrians straight to them . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> libertarian economics runs contrary to modern economic theory . <eos>
