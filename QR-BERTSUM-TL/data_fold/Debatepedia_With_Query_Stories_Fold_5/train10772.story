<s> controversies : are there enough contentious calls to justify replay ? <eos>

<s> modern society is based on the idea of justice and merit . in sport the better team should win . chance in the rules and umpires should not playing a part . when fans find conclusive evidence that a call has been missed and that their team should have won ( or whatever ) feelings of injustice can turn into rage . this was seen on display with galarraga 's # perfect game that was robbed from him by a bad call . the fans were livid . these feelings can and should be avoided by introducing instant replay into baseball . <eos>

@highlight

<s> instant replay ensures fan/player feelings of justice over anger <eos>
