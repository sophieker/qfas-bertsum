<s> iran : would withdrawal benefit the united states ' ability to deal with iran ? <eos>

<s> the united states is iran 's other main adversary . it benefits immensely from the united state 's current predicament in iraq as it distracts and weakens the united states . if the united states believes that iran is an enemy that it needs to focus attention on than it should withdraw from iraq and re-focus its energies on iran . <eos>

<s> the iraq war has benefited iran by distracting and weakening its us adversaries . <eos>
