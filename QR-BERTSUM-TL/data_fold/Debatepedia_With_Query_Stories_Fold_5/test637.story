<s> network owners : is net neutrality good for isps ? <eos>

<s> - internet service providers are businesses that make huge investments in building internet pipelines with high bandwidth capacities . this bandwidth is not public infrastructure . other parties that take up a significant amount of the provided bandwidth are costing isps a significant amount of money by forcing them to expand their infrastructures . these parties are often reaping huge profits off of this for-profit bandwidth without paying anything in return to the isps . the isps have a right to seek return on their investment and demand that such bandwidth users pay a higher price for their heavy use . <eos>

@highlight

<s> isps have a right to recover costs from heavy bandwidth users <eos>
