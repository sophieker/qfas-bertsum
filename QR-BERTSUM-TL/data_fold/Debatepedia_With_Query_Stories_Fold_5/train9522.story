<s> iranian response ? would iran respond in a catastrophic fashion ? <eos>

<s> george perkovich and silvia manzanero the carnegie endowment for international peace argue in `` iran gets the bomb-then what ? '' on # / # that `` iran does not lack means to deter and/or retaliate against military attacks against it . iranian revolutionary guards reportedly have deployed action cells in iraq . these cells appear not to have been activated yet but rather are to provide capabilities to attack u.s. forces in the region if iranian decision-makers judge it necessary to respond to u.s. actions in iraq and/or against iran . nor can the possibility be dismissed that iran has terrorist capabilities deployed in europe south america or even the continental united states for activation if necessary . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an attack on iran would cause a significant violent terrorist backlash by iran . <eos>
