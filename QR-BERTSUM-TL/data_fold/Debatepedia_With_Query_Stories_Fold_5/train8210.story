<s> china/india outsourcing : are exemption justified in context of outsourcing ? <eos>

<s> it is true that china is a manufacturing behemoth and emitting small quantities of greenhouse gasses as a result . but who is consuming the majority of the goods made in the factories in china that is causing their huge carbon footprint ? developed countries are the chief consumers and driver of this manufacturing and emissions . they have therefore a certain responsibility for the manufacturing and emissions that are occurring in china and india . this is where exemption for parts of their emissions help compensate for the fact they they alone are not responsible for this manufacturing and emissions - the world is responsible . <eos>

@highlight

<s> developed state demands drives emission in developing state <eos>
