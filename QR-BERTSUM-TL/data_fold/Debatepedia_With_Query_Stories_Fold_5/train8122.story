<s> pakistan government : could the pakistani governments tolerate a unilateral we strike ? <eos>

<s> - respond to us proposals in early # to allow increased cia activities in india president musharraf condemned the idea saying that it would breach india sovereignty . given the clarity of musharraf 's opposition to the idea it is clear that any us insistence to implement such attacks would seriously strain relations between the two countries . it is but possible that musharraf would militarily resist such unilateral operation as he has claimed that he would do . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a unilateral us attack inside pakistan could be strongly opposed by pakistan <eos>
