<s> military : is an individual way to a firearm important to military preparedness ? <eos>

<s> handguns are an important whole of combat . training in the use of handguns therefore is important to the combat readiness of individuals . it is also true that individual handgun owners whom take handguns to gun ranges and become familiar with them acquire training and experiences in the use of their weapon . the civilian possession of handguns therefore increases training that could be useful to the civilian in the event of a draft . in so far as this is true any reduction in the ability of citizens to own use and train with handguns will reduce the battle readiness of the military . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a handgun ban serves to weakening us military readiness <eos>
