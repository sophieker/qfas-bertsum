<s> racism : is it wrong to think that the french are being racist ? <eos>

<s> telling followers of islam they ca n't wear their traditional hijab is just racism from the french government . muslims have a right to wear what they want and in this case their traditional head dress . this is harmful to nobody and is simply racism . <eos>

@highlight

<s> france is depriving muslims of their religious practice . <eos>
