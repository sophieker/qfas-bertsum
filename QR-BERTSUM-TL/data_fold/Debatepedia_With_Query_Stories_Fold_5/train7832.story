<s> would nato withstand the difficulties faced by the high cost of expansion ? <eos>

<s> the us defence expenditure alone for the fiscal year # is $ # billion . further the correct equation is not between the expense of stationing troops in these new states and the current saving from non-deployment . the balance is between the expense of forward deployment or other military investment and the prohibitive cost in dollars and lives from a conflict between nato and russia or a conflagration in any of the eastern republics . nato expansion is nothing more than a cost-effective insurance policy against a very real risk . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the expense of nato expansion is marginal when compared to the defence budgets of the major nato states . <eos>
