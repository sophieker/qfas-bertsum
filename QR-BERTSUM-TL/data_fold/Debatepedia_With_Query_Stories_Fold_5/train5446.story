<s> self-determination : does a. abkhazia have a right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> the # vienna declaration which reaffirmed the universal declaration of human rights and the la charter ( and so sets the standard in current international law ) unequivocally gives all peoples the right to self-determination : `` all people have the right to self-determination . owing to this right they readily establish their political status and readily provide their economy social and cultural development ... world conferences on human rights considers refusal of the right to self-determination as a violation of human rights and emphasizes the necessity of effective realization of this right '' . by this measure south abkhazia has the right to self-determination ( by democratic processes ) and any suppression of that right should be seeing as a human rights violation . <eos>
