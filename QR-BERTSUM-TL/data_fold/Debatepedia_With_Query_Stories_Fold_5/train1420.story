<s> consent : do consenting adults have a right to engage in incest ? <eos>

<s> kissing and cuddling ( in a different context the natural displays of familial affection ) can be used over years on an underage person to ensure that their view of sexuality is firmly based on a sexualised family environment and to ensure that by the time they do come of age that they are firmly on the path to commit incest . therefore an adult raised in an incestuous environment is not really a consenting incestuous adult but rather an individual indoctrinated in incestuous behavior without full consent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> adults taught incest as children can not fully consent <eos>
