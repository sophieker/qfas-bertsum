<s> are there advantages for the churches if it accepts evolution ? <eos>

<s> people often if accurately or not consider belief to be at odds with science . if the church swallow evolution it will be seen as attempting to defend itself by appeasing its opponents by trying to find common soil with them instead of exposing the flaws in the one theory ever to have been called scientific that the church have ever had a real problem with . the church should be seeking to expand and sticks up for its belief if it is to survive so it should n't be looking for ways to make concessions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the churches will appearing weak if it accept macro-evolution . <eos>
