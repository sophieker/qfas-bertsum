<s> time : would the time consume by instantly replay be limited ? <eos>

<s> one option is to implement the nfl s shut-down system which limits teams to two replays per game . another is a broader option that allows operators in mlb s central replay office to stop the game to reviews a call . both of these systems would significantly limit the time consumed by a replay system . the minimum time added would be something like # minutes to a game in exceptional circumstances . this is but worth ensuring games are won fairly . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many replay systems could adequately reduce when consumed . <eos>
