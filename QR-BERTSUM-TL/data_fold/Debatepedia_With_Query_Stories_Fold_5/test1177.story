<s> state interests : are state interests upheld in the primary election process ? <eos>

<s> while the primary system is complicated this complication also produces pride within states and at precinct levels in the uniqueness of their particular process . this creates in voters a sense of identity with their state and party and the process that they jointly develop . this is natural since the united states is a government based on power-sharing between the federal and state governments . state governments benefit from the sense of pride and belonging that primaries foster . in short the complicated primary system keeps states relevant and preserves their constitutional power . <eos>

@highlight

<s> primaries create pride in unique local systems <eos>
