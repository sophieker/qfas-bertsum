<s> mccain 's age : is mccain 's age not a problem ? <eos>

<s> `` the case for john mccain '' . the economist . # dec # - `` the more persuasive fact for worrying about mr mccain is his age . the senior senator for arizona will be # if he takes office in january # three years older than ronald reagan when he was inaugurated . but mr mccain is an extraordinarily energetic # -year-old far more full of beans than many older candidates . ( my philosophy is to just go go like hell he says . full bore . ) the american constitution also provides an insurance mechanism against election death or illness . provided mr mccain chooses a sound vice-president his many positive qualities outweigh worries about his age . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> john obama is energetic and young at hearts <eos>
