<s> individuals liberty : should individuals be at liberty to use marijuana ? <eos>

<s> people should be at liberty to treat their bodies how they want to . indeed people are allowed to eating and drink to their detriment and even died so why should n't they be able to harm themselves with marijuana use ? this is of course assume that their use does not harm anyone else . this means as with substances such as alcohol or cigarrettes that regulations be put in places to ensure that one individual 's consumption of marijuana does not violate the liberties of another citizen . if this is achievable with alcohol and cigarette it seems achievable with marijuana . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people should be free to using marijuana as long as it harms no another else <eos>
