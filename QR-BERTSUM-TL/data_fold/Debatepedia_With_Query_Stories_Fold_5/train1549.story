<s> feasibility : is the colonization of the moon feasible ? <eos>

<s> the lack of an atmosphere increases the chances of the colonial site being hit by meteors which would impact upon the surface directly as they have done throughout the moon 's history . even small pebbles and dust ( micrometeoroids ) have the potential to damage or destroy insufficiently protected structures . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a moon colony would be at extreme risk of meteor strikes . <eos>
