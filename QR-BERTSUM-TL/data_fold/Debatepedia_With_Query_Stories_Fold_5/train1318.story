<s> lftr reactors : are liquid fluoride plutonium reactors ( lftr ) a good idea ? <eos>

<s> unlike pwr 'growth operate at high pressure which is unfavorable because of lower mechanical load on reactors vessel and other parts of the machinery hence lowering the risk of accident . it also increases the size of containment building required to enclose the reactor . <eos>
