<s> risks : is a moon mission considerably safer and thus desirable ? <eos>

<s> `` first step in terraforming mars . '' on to mars : `` when we compare our moon to mars we see that mars is much easier to terraform then the moon . the moon 's 28 day day-night cycle is unsupportable for plants and is n't comfortable for humans either . plant growth on a greenhouse on the moon would n't be possible either : solar radiation would destroy them and if the greenhouse was made to shield the solar radiation ( a very thick greenhouse ) the temperature differences would kill the plants : much too hot during day-time much too cold during the night .

<s> mars can be terraformed while moon can not <eos>
