<s> fetus rights : is it wrong to assign rights to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> some argue that abortion is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future . indeed killing any human being is wrong because it deprives the victim of a valuable future : any experiences activities projects and enjoyments that they would have enjoyed . abortion is particularly egregious because it deprives a fetus of all experiences as a human being . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortion deprives a fetus of an entire human future : <eos>
