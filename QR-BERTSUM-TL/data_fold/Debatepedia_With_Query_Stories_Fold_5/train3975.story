<s> is overthrowing/assassinating a dictator a sufficient justification for terrorism ? <eos>

<s> the alternatives to assassination would all leave a dictator in power for many years . in that time not only will many more people suffer under a repressive system but the policies pursued by an out-of-touch and unrepresentative regime are likely to do serious ( if unintentional ) harm to the whole nation and its economy making eventual rebuilding much more costly in both human and economic terms . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there are no good alternatives to assassination . <eos>
