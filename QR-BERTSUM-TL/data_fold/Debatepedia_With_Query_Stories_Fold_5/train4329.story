<s> infrastructure : is a hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure possible ? <eos>

<s> amory lovins ceo of rocky mountain institute . `` twenty hydrogen myths '' . # june # - `` myth # . hydrogen can t be distributed in existing pipelines requiring costly new ones . if remote centralized production of hydrogen eventually did prove competitive or necessary as this myth assumes then existing gas transmission pipelines could generally be converted to hydrogen service e.g . by adding polymer-composite liners similar to those now used to renovate old water and sewer pipes plus a hydrogen-blocking metallized coating or liner ( analogous to those used in composite hydrogen tanks ) and by converting the compressors .

<s> existing pipelines can be used in a new hydrogen economy <eos>
