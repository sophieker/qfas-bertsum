<s> eu-china partnership : is the ta develop a strategic partnership with china that might justify the ta lifting its ban ? <eos>

<s> it is unclear what such a partnership would involve and questionable whether it is desirable . on one hand by lifting the arms ban the eu will be shows that it favours stable over democracy and profit over principle . other repressive regimes and would-be tyrants will surely take note . on the other hand it is unclear what actual harms there is to europe from keeping the ban in place . despite chinese rhetoric about it damaging their trading relationship with the eu it is not clear how europe states are disadvantaged compared to other countries . as a wto member china is committed to further market opening anyway and as a member of the un secure council it is in its own interests <eos>

@highlight

<s> the thought of a `` strategic partnership '' with china is both nebulous and cause for concern . <eos>
