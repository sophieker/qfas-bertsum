<s> split delegates : would split the delegates between obama and clinton make sense ? <eos>

<s> the main problem with using the january # results is that the candidates did not definitely campaign there . this means that the candidates did not necessarily represent themselves sufficiently and that the voter may have been fairly uninformed . additionally there is the problem that many floridians and michigan voter may have simply not voted due to their understanding at the time that their vote would not count . all of this invalidates the original results to some extent . splitting the results would give the state its delegates and a semblance of representation while avoiding the above pitfalls . <eos>

<s> splitting michigan and florida delegate would avoid pitfalls of allotting them according to january 's results . <eos>
