<s> vetted warming solutions : should the un forbid solutions that worsen poverty ? <eos>

<s> a wide arrays of approaches exist to solving climate change . some of these approaches would alleviate poverty while some would exacerbate it . it is possibility thus for the un to prioritize approaches to climate changing that alleviate poverty and deemphasize - or even ban - approaches that exacerbate it . this would ensure that efforts to combat climate changing and global poverty are always complimentary . but it would stem from a position that poverty reduction is a greater priority than and should not be jeopardized by efforts to combat climate change . <eos>

@highlight

<s> un should adopt only solutions to climate changing that help the poor . <eos>
