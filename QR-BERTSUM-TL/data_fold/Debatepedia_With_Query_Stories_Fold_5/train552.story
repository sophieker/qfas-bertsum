<s> deterrence : can reactors powers maintaining deterrence under a reactors tests ban ? <eos>

<s> the most important way to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons is through nuclear deterrence . that is by convincing non-nuclear states that developing a nuclear weapons programs is futile in the faces of significant nuclear powers . therefore in so far as a nuclear tests ban will diminish the arsenals of nuclear powers it will will diminish the power of nuclear deterrence to limit nuclear proliferation . <eos>

<s> nuclear deterrence not test bans is best for non-proliferation <eos>
