<s> cultural standards : does assimilation set a false moral-cultural standard ? <eos>

<s> while there are some very basic unifying principles and values that can and should be adopted universally it is impossible for a government to select a single broad-sweeping moral-cultural standard . indeed many cultural values are subjective and relative and should not be discriminated against in favor of what a government deems to be a superior unifying model . whose to judge right and wrong in particular regarding cultural matters ? at a minimum governments risk expanding their regulatory authority too far past the area in which we can all agree on unifying principles and into the realm where there is no `` right and wrong '' but only subjective cultural distinctions . assimilation inherently carries these risks of inappropriate government interference . <eos>
