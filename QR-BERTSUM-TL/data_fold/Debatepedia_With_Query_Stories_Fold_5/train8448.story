<s> environment : would aiding the us auto industry help the environment ? <eos>

<s> foreign automakers have been much better at producing fuel efficient vehicles than us automakers . european and japanese car companies have been producing 35 mpg cars for years and are set to produce 45 mpg cars by roughly 2015. it is better in the context of global warming to rely on these `` greener '' automakers than on us automakers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> non-american automakers are better suppliers of green cars . <eos>
