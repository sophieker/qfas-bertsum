<s> morality : is the bail out of greece morally permissible ? <eos>

<s> david d. moenning . `` greece makes choice between 'collapse or salvation ' . '' american foreign policy . may # : `` although the spending cuts are severe the harsh terms for aid should serve as a deterrent to other countries looking for a bailout . with the rest of the pigis ( portugal italy greece ireland and spain ) experiencing tough times due to massive debt buildups germany does n't want to provide a quick-and-easy bailout to all comers . when countries see that greece 's path with the imf 's strict terms is not easy they will do everything to avoid that for themselves . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> austerity measures of greek bailout set good precedent <eos>
