<s> choice : do voucher introduce advantageous choice to education ? <eos>

<s> children and students have a way to choose what school they will attend . forcing a child to attend a public school even if it is not a healthy and productive environment for them is wrong . vouchers afford child and their children are way to choose which school best fits their need and desires . it affords greater decision-making power and liberty to citizens instead of the state on a matter of tremendous importance to their life and futures . this is righteous in principle . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vouchers honor right of parents/students to choosing schools <eos>
