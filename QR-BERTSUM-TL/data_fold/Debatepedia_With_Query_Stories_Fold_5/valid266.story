<s> holman r. jenkins . `` bashing bankers is a political duty . '' wall street journal . january # # > `` did n't taxpayers bail out the financial systems so do n't taxpayers deserve the bonuses ? no . taxpayers ( aka voters ) were acting in their own interests in bailed out the system . they were n't doing anybody a favor . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> bailout benefiting taxpayers ; repayment unnecessary <eos>
