<s> feasibility : is full denuclearization feasible ? <eos>

<s> the radioactive element within the warhead can not just be turned off or put into storage . the only thing that can be done that is beneficial and not harmful is to put them to use in a nuclear power plant but to build all those costs to much and there fore is unfeasible and there fore unthinkable . as fore destroying them that would require detonation and if you wish to rid the world of these then you would n't want that so there fore there is nothing that can be done . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear weapons can not just be simply destroyed or dismantled <eos>
