<s> cultural standards : does assimilation set a false moral-cultural standard ? <eos>

<s> a major argument used for assimilation posits that it is wrong to allow practices such as veiling ( typically in muslim cultures ) because it may be subject to abuse in which women are involuntarily forced to wear the hijab . this does occur . but there are also many instances in which women make an independent choice to wear the hijab as an `` act of faith '' or for other reasons . should voluntary instances be forbidden along with involuntary instances ? no . it is wrong to ban the wearing of the hijab in all instances merely to prevent instances of abuse . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assimilation wrongly bans practices due to rare abuses <eos>
