<s> unwanted/adoption : is abortion ok in dealing with `` unwanted '' children ? vs. adoption ? <eos>

<s> if the woman was the only consideration in abortions than it might make sense for them to avoid the pain of child-birth . but her interests are not the only ones in play . the life of the fetus is very important as well . preserving the life of the fetus is worth the risks and pains incurred by the woman in child-birth . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a woman must bear the pain/risks of birth ; the life of the fetus is worth it . <eos>
