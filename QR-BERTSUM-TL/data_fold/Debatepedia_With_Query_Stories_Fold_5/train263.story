<s> abuse : is the vetoed power topic to individual interests ? <eos>

<s> the threat of the use of the veto is as powerful in preventing resolutions being passed as the actual veto itself . member-nations countries often notify promoters of a resolutions that they will veto it subsequently causing those promoters to back down and to never actually bring legislative to the room of the general assembly . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the `` hidden '' threats of the un veto is a major concern <eos>
