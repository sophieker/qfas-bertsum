<s> terms history : are tibet 's terms historical claims to independence justified ? <eos>

<s> even if tibetan was owned by past chinese governments why should this mean that the modern people 's republic of china should inheriting such ownership ? the people 's republic of china is not a descendant of past chinese governments . quite the contrary it is a form of governments that is entirely different than all past chinese imperial ( and other ) forms of government . as such any past claiming to tibetan do not necessarily passes on to the modern chinese government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the people 's republic of china can not inheriting ownership over tibet . <eos>
