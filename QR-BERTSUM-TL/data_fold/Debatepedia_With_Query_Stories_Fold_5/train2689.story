<s> regional impact : could the partitioning of iraq have a negative impacts in the region ? <eos>

<s> rend al rahman washington post `` partition is not the solution '' # / # / # - `` the most probable outcome of this violent competition for territory resource and power [ following a partition ] would be a radical sunni taliban-style regime in the west and in parts of central iraq that would be a breed soil for terrorism . in the south it is likely there would be a fundamentalist shiite regime pliant to iran 's will . in both cases these would be authoritarian regimes hostile to pluralism and genuine democracy . uncontrolled by a stunted and impotent national government these governments would use their resource to promote their radical ideologies abroad support minded movements in neighboring countries and destabilize the region . meanwhile baghdad would remain a war-torn city <eos>

<s> iraq 's neighbors would oppose a partitioning plan and possibly seek to intervene militarily : <eos>
