<s> global diversity : would the adoption of the american way of life mean the decay of unique global cultures ? <eos>

<s> in order to survive the cultures of the world have never -- and must never -- adapted to new conditions and realities . as america s global authority increasingly becomes a reality cultures will begin to gradually move towards the american way of life not as a product of force but rather as a natural consequence of increased contact with america s dominant culture . some cultural institutions will be lost others will survive and still others will become altered in reactions to it . resisting the evolutionary impact of the american way of life could only serve to counteract an extremely important process in the histories of the world s cultures .

<s> no cultures in the worlds can survived in unchanging . <eos>
