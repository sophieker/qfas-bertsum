<s> civilian presence : has chinese abusively militarized tibet ? <eos>

<s> china 's military presence in tibet is a justified response to a serious separatist threat both inside of tibet and from the tibetan government in exile in india . this is a serious threat to the integrity and unity of chinese and the government has the way to take unsubtle action against it . if tibetans renounced their rebellious separatism the military presence would be unnecessary . maybe this should be the focus for change in tibet instead of independence . if tibetans becoming less inclined to seek independence much of the conditions that cause them to seek independence - like a military presence - would be ended . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china 's civilian is in tibet due to the separatists threats there . <eos>
