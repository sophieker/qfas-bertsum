<s> impact on violence : has a handgun ban decreased violence and crime in dc ? <eos>

<s> the handgun is used more commonly than any other weapons in self defense in the home . roughly 80 percent of all self-defense occurs with handguns according to some sources . [ 9 ] this is because it is small can be easily stowed in a house where it may be of need and because it is easy to wield and fire . to ban a weapon that is so important in self-defense would reduce the capacity of citizens to defend themselves making citizens more vulnerable and possibly inviting further robberies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a handgun ban deprives citizens of the most commonly used weapon for self defense <eos>
