<s> . this would break the country into four regions with the states in each region holding their primaries simultaneously on the first tuesday of march april may and june . every year the regions would rotate with a new region getting the chance to go first . this would solve the problem of new hampshire and iowa receiving far too much voting power would generally average-out the voting power of different states and voters and yet would also preserve the basic state-primary systems and their important function in giving states due power . <eos>

<s> rotating regional primaries solve the problems of the current process <eos>
