<s> moral : is abolish nuclear weapons a required moral act ? <eos>

<s> over the past fifty year we have seen a general tendency towards limited warfare and precision weapons allowing military objectives to be achieved with minimal loss of civilian life . the entire point of nuclear weapons however is their massive indiscriminate destructive power . their use would kill tens of thousands of civilian directly and their catastrophic ecological after-effects would harm many more all up the world . these effects would never be morally acceptable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear weapons unethically threaten mass murder . <eos>
