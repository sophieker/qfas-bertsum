<s> does trading with human liberties abusers encourage human liberties abuses ? <eos>

<s> while it is true that some sanctions have caused massive harm to the people of the country particularly sanctions on iraq and cuba that is because these sanctions was/is not aimed at ending human rights mistreatment but rather at punishing the country . it is possible to trading directly with the people of a country while bypassing the dictators or human rights abusers . and in many cases lack of trading to human rights abusers does not stop employment for the ordinary people . for example in burma most workers and peasants working in the informal economy so a lack of foreign capital would n't affect them at all . <eos>

@highlight

<s> blocking trade with human rights abuser does not imply bringing no work . <eos>
