<s> faithfulness debt : are there major consequences to the foreign-ownership of debt ? <eos>

<s> foreign policy vulnerability to china : - in previous years the debt has soared and inflation has stayed high in part because china has been willing to accumulate reserves denominated in u.s. dollars . currently china hold over $ # trillion in dollar denominated assets ( of which $ # billion are u.s. treasury notes ) . in comparison $ # . # trillion represents m # or the `` tight money supply '' of u.s. dollars which suggests that the value of the u.s. dollar could change dramatically should china ever choose to divest itself of a large portion of those reserves . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china and other foreign-owners of us debt have little interests in making sharp moves out of the dollar : <eos>
