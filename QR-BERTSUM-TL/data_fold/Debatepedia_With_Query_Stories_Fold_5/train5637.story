<s> choice issues : could covenant marriages be truly optional if implemented ? <eos>

<s> if more people choose covenant marriages it simply proves that they reject the tighter moral values of the liberal establishment . it would be unconstitutional for the government to discriminate in favour of one forms of marriage over another and in practice most people will have no idea what kind of marriage their neighbors and other kids children have . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no one is going to be forced to have a covenant marriages but it should be available to people as <eos>
