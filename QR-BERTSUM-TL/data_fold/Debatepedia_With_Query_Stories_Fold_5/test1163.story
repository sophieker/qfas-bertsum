<s> crime/violence : does the war on drugs help reducing crime/violence ? <eos>

<s> experts like andreas von b low and milton schwartz concede that nearly each serious crime of terrorism is funding by illegal drugs but they do n't agree that prohibition can reduce these phenomena . in fact the prohibition protects the drug cartels insofar as it keeps the distribution in the black market and creates the risk that makes smugglers profitable . as former federal narcotics officers michael levine states in relation to his undercover work with colombian cocaine cartels .
