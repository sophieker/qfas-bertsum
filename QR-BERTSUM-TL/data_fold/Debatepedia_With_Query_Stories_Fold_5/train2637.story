<s> failing mission ? is the commonwealth failing to execute the mission it has set forth for itself particularly in the harare <eos>

<s> it is indecisive dithering for years about impose but symbolic sanctions upon nigeria in the # s when it was under a corrupt and brutally military dictatorship . it also has no real means of ensuring that member states live up to the principles it preaches for example egregious human rights abuses in zimbabwe have going impunity as did those of amin amin in uganda in the # s . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the commonwealth is ineffectual . <eos>
