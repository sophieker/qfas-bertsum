<s> mail-in re-vote : does a mail-in re-vote concepts make sense ? <eos>

<s> on march # th # the florida democratic party rejected the idea of holding a re-vote of any kind . this means that even if there is a justification for doing so it wo n't happen . it also means that there is not popular will in florida to make it happen which would make it particularly inappropriate to try to pushing forward a re-vote . <eos>
