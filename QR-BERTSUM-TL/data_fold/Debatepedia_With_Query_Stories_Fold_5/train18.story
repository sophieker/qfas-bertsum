<s> there are many possibility ways in which gay marriage would lead to other attacks on the basic principle of marriage . it is possibility that gay marriage will be seen as an opportunity by polygamists and polyamorists to attempt to obtain marriage rights . what logic would stop this if marriage is offered to homosexuals ? if the traditional definition of marriage is stretched to include homosexuals what rationale would preventing it from being stretched to include polygamy and polyamory ? the same justifications for gay marriage would be put forward by polygamists and polyamorists ; that there relationships is based on love and commitment . and obviously if marriage is extend to these groups the traditional institution of marriage and the principle that it stands <eos>

@highlight

<s> gay marriage is muddy slope to polygamous marriage etc <eos>
