<s> bribe ? - is plead bargaining for testimony different to bribery ? <eos>

<s> offering plea bargain for a testimony is similar to entrapment which is illegal : in entrapment a cops officer may withhold capturing and subsequently punishing a criminal in exchanges for concessions from that criminal usually in the form of money . this is widely considered corrupt and illegal . in ask for a testimony from a criminal in exchanges for a plea bargain and increased sentence a similar thing is happening ; officials are withholding punishment ( even if only partially ) in exchanges for a concessions from a criminal ( an incriminating testimony ) . the similarities here are strong enough to ask why one is illegal and the other common practice ? <eos>
