<s> race <eos>

<s> many republicans support race-neutral admissions policies in universities but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student . this is because these conditions can be more important in determining the potential for a student to succeed than race . indeed it seems unfair that a black student from a wealthy and educated family should be given an advantage over a poor white student . <eos>

@highlight

<s> reps see economic factors more important than race in affirm action . <eos>
