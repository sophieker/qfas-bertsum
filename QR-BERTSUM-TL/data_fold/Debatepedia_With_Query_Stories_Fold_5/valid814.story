<s> charity : which fostering greater charity ? <eos>

<s> every resource considered by the majority to be either necessary or highly desirable is supplied through government . government acquires these resources via taxation . tax does not require consent . therefore the resources used and provided to members of a society are not obtained through voluntary giving which is the definition of charity . since the majority in a socialist society believes that everyone has access to all necessary and highly desirable resources then they have little motivation to sacrifice their personal resources to benefit another members of that society . they believe that it is not their responsibility to help others rather responsibility exists within government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is less charities in a communist society . <eos>
