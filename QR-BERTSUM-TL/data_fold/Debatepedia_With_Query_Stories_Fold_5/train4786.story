<s> free speech : does limitless spending uphold free speech ? <eos>

<s> free speech is protected under the constitution meaning anyone can say what they want . but spending unlimited amounts of cash to propagate a message intimidate candidates and sway elections is not protected . in other words corporations speaker do have some free speech liberties to develop an election ad ( through such things as pacs ) but not to then spent unlimited amounts of cash to propagate their message . <eos>

@highlight

<s> corporate spend does n't counts as `` speech '' <eos>
