<s> thought : should some animal have rights on the basis of complex thought ? <eos>

<s> human beings are infinitely more complex than any other living creatures . their ability to know and talking to form society systems with rights and responsibilities and to feeling emotions are uniquely developed but beyond any other animals . it is reasonable to try to prevent the most obviously cases of gratuitous suffering or torture of animals but beyond that humans animals do not deserve to be given rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the higher complexity of beings warrants that we nothing should have `` rights '' . <eos>
