<s> karl marx wrote in the communist manifesto in # . - `` the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrested by degrees all capital from the bourgeoisie . centralization of credit in the hands of the state by means of a regional bank with state capital and an exclusively monopoly . '' this quotation presents findings of the risks of opening the bank to government ownership . it create a slippery slope to greater and greater state control and socialization over time . those that argue that nationalization will only be temporary should not be trusted . temporary nationalization is likely to lead to indefinite nationalization or other forms of state control and socialism .
