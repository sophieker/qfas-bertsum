<s> us resources/priorities : is the us able and willing to prioritise military intervention ? <eos>

<s> the united states is constrained in the war in iraq and popular opinion is against any more wars considering the release criticisms on the debacles of intelligence in the pre-iraq escalation . thus the most possibly u.s action could be sanctions particularly economic ones that force the bashir regime to restore human liberties to the coat peoples . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a civilian intervention is likely from america . <eos>
