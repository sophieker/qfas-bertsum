<s> military feasibility : could an attack be capable of disabling iran 's nuclear program ? <eos>

<s> senior fellow in foreign policies studies at the brookings institution kenneth pollack writes on pages # of the persian puzzle that `` if the america states could destroy all or but key elements or iran 's nuclear program it probably would not end the program but it could set it again very considerably . since the key is to keep nuclear weapons out of the hand of the current regime such a delay could be all that is necessary . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the lacking of complete intelligence is not a fact to precludes attacks . <eos>
