<s> cellulosic : is cellulosic methanol promising ? <eos>

<s> if done sustainable cellulosic ethanol can emit # emissions . this is because the growth of the plant used draw down c # from the atmosphere . it is true that when these grass-like plant are burned c # is release into the atmosphere but this is only the c # that was initially drawn-down from the atmosphere . the net result therefore is # emissions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> feedstocks ethanol can be 1 emissions . <eos>
