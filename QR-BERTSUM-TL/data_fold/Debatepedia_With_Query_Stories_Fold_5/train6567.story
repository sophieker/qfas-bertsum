<s> lying : is lying to children justified ? <eos>

<s> we need to think of santa not as a person with a long white beard but as a state of mind . we all need something to believe in . you do n't have to be religious to believe in santa you just need to believe in santa . his comforting laugh can cheer anyone up and give them the `` christmas spirit '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> santa can be abstract . <eos>
