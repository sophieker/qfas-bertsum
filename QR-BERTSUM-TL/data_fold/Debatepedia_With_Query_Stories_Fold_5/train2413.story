<s> free trade : is the ban on exports better than free trade without barriers ( concerning child labour ) ? <eos>

<s> imposing economic sanctions on countries where child labour is common could `` increase the hours worked by children '' . based on a survey of child workers in rural pakistan is was found that child labour `` was driven by poverty and the need for families to earn a minimum income . '' when hourly wages fell children tend to make up for the `` implied loss in income by working longer hours '' or seeking `` other paid work at a lower wage '' . [ study by university of bristol economist sonia bhalotra ] <eos>
