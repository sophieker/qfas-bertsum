<s> gateway drug : is marijuana not a gateway drug ? <eos>

<s> marijuana is regarded a `` soft '' drug as compared with `` harder '' drugs such as heroin heroine and crystal meth . this is because it is than addictive and generally regarded than harmful than these other drugs . but the problems is that as a `` soft '' drug marijuana acts as a stepped stones or `` gateway '' to `` harder '' drugs . having tried marijuana and having been indoctrinated into the world of `` mind-altering '' drugs people are much more likely to then try harder drugs . the illegality of marijuana creates a barrier before this `` gateway '' . <eos>
