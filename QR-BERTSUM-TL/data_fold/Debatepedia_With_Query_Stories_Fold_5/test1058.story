<s> cutting off internet : is this an appropriate `` proportional '' punishment ? <eos>

<s> graduated response would cut off internet access for those ignoring the first two warning only temporarily from between # months to a year and possibly less for people that promise to never again pirate musive and other files illegally . this means that cutting off internet access can be measured proportionately to the severity of the infringement that took place . <eos>
