<s> effectiveness : do earmarks allocating spending effectively ? <eos>

<s> sometimes a good piece of legislation that receives the support of a majority of congressman will be holding up and vote down purely on the basis that it contain an egregious unrelated earmark . this undermines the democratic process in which ideas are judged and vote on based on their own merits . it also opens the door to unfortunate political maneuvering in which congressmen inserted favorable or controversial earmarks into a piece of legislation as a meaning of holding up a bill they oppose . <eos>

@highlight

<s> earmarks are often irrelevant to legislation ; holds up bill . <eos>
