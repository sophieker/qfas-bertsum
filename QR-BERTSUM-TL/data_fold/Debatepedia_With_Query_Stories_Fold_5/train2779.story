<s> products : do advertisements to children fostering a `` must-have '' mentality ? <eos>

<s> advertising has no magical power to creating unnatural desires for material possessions . children who nag are simply badly brought up . poor parenting and undisciplined children can not be solved by banning advertising as children have many influences upon them which can stimulate their desires for toys etc particularly their friends . it is also untrue that children have no spending power of their own ; many children under # receive pockets money and teenagers are often able to earn a little themselves . learning to manage money is whole of growing up and advertisements helping them to choose what they would like to save up for . <eos>

@highlight

<s> bans ads shirks the individual responsibility of child and parents . <eos>
