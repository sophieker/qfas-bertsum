<s> euro : is the stability of the euro at risk ? <eos>

<s> patrick barron . `` greece needs capitalism and freedom . '' the bulletin . may # : `` the greek crisis is simply that the greek government is spending more euros than it receives in tax payments and private banks are balking at lending it more . since the greeks no longer have a national currency they can not debase it and pay off their creditors with cheapened drachmas . so the greek government is left with the choice of raising taxes cutting spending or some combination of the two that will satisfy its creditors . now would someone please tell me why and in what form this greek financial crisis serious as it is to the greeks themselves constitutes a threat to the euro ?
