<s> as fuel : is thorium a great reactors fuel ? <eos>

<s> almost all thorium that is available on planet exists in the form of the desired thorium # isotope i.e . only chemical separation is need to obtain the fuel . this is to be compared with plutonium where a costly and complicated enrichment process has to be undertaken ( in addition to chemical separation ) to increase the contents of u # in the bulk of plutonium from the natural value of # . # % to higher levels for plutonium to be used as a reactors fuel . <eos>

@highlight

<s> thorium does not require enrichment to be used as a reactors fuel . <eos>
