<s> international will -- is the international will to intervened in conflicts in africa low anyway ? <eos>

<s> just because the intervening country used infantry or tanks instead of negotiation or aerial bombardment ( kosovo ) doesn t make it any more likely to restore peace . on a global scales vietnam is the classic example of how using infantry to intervene in a guerrilla war is a fruitless exercise . on an african stage the infantry interventions by neighboring countries has only increased the death toll not the success at ending the war . <eos>

@highlight

<s> national battalion forces are ill-suited for effective interventions : <eos>
