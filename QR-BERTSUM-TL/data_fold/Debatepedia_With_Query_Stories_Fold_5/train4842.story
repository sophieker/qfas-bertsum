<s> accountability : does nclb make teachers and school more accountable ? <eos>

<s> punishing teachers for the poor performances of students fails to address the main issue ; how to better or differently instruct students . teachers already have the best interest of their students at heart . punishing them wrongly assumes that this is not the case or that teachers can not simply recognize the need to improve their methods if things are not going well . <eos>

@highlight

<s> k-12 counter-productively punishes teachers/schools <eos>
