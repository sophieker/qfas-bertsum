<s> competition : can co-ops scale to compete with private insurers ? <eos>

<s> it is not a necessary factor for individual co-ops to be able to scale . instead if the model itself can scale but in a decentralized and more community-focused way the model can work very well in filling the gaps left by the private insurance industry . and in this sense co-ops can compete well on a local level . <eos>
