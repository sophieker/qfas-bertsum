<s> religion : what are the religious arguments in this debate ? <eos>

<s> robert meyer renew america columnist `` why capital punishment is pro-life '' renew america . # sept. # - `` the term 'an eye for an eye ' in the scriptures is not a directive for authority to seek vigilante vengeance nor necessarily a mandate to recompense a literal eye-for-eye . this statement represents the biblical principle of lex talionis that is the crime must be proportional with the punishment . often times in biblical law the victim had rights in determining the precise punishment up to a limit . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> religious arguments are irrelevant to the legality of capital punishment . <eos>
