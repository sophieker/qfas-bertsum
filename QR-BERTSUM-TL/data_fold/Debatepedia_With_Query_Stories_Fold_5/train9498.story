<s> barry posen . `` the risk of stay vs. leave iraq '' . boston globe . april # th # - `` if the civil war intensifies regional powers will rush in . this too is already under way but escalation into a giant civil war is not in anyone 's interest . syria iran and turkey have kurdish minorities which may become restive during such a war . the saudis would likely prefer that their sunni arab friends make a deal rather than wage a fight that they could lose . even iran whose sunni co-religionists stand to win such a war faces risks . the arab sunni are not one big happy family ; they kill each other in iraq today . most iraqi sunni think of themselves as arabs ; heavy-handed iranian intervention <eos>
