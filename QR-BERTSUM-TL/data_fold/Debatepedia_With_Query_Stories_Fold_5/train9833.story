<s> responsibility ? do beings have the responsibility to protect other animals against extinction ? <eos>

<s> the species homo sapiens is unprecedented and unique among all life on earth . human sentience and knowledge far surpass those of other creatures . these gifts have allowed human beings to populate the earth construct industry and affect the environment in a way that no other species can . this great power goes with great responsibility and we should avoid abusing the earth lest we cause irreparable damage - damage like the extinctions of species and the consequent reduction in biodiversity cause by deforestation over-fishing hunting the illegal trade in ivory and other species etc . <eos>

@highlight

<s> humans have the unique ability to understand the value of protecting animal as well as the capacity to do so . <eos>
