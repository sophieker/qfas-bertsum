<s> emergency : is abortion justified in order to save the life of a mother ? <eos>

<s> there is a difference between letting a woman die from the presence of a fetus and the process of giving birth and actively killing a fetus . one is `` letting die '' the other is `` killing '' . the distinction is important and is a good reason to oppose abortion even during special emergencies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> letting a woman die is better than directly killing an unborn baby <eos>
