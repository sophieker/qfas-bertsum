<s> obesity epidemic ? is there an obesity epidemic that a `` fat tax '' responds to ? <eos>

<s> there are some disorders or biological propensities that cause individuals to eating too much or that cause them to be obese irrespective of the types of food that they consume . individuals living with such inherent difficulty would not necessarily benefit from a `` fat tax '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a fat-tax wo n't solve the problems of over-eating . <eos>
