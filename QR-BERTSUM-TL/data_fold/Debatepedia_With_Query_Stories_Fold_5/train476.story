<s> small states : is the college unnecessary to protect small state interests ? <eos>

<s> the current system provides for the protection of the rights of all 50 states because it forces candidates to appeal to the voters in all parts of america . it is important to remember that america is not a centralized state but a federation of states . a nationwide vote tally could provide an incentive for a candidate to focus only on the most populous areas of the country such as california new york or texas and ignore other areas such as alaska rhode island or maine . the electoral college is a natural consequence of the devolved state-based government that americans have always supported . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the electoral college helps protect the interests of smaller states in the union <eos>
