<s> functionality : is a republic more functional ? or does the monarchy `` work just fine '' ? <eos>

<s> in modernity the degree to which a government is `` undemocratic '' is in large part the degree to which it can be regarded `` broken '' . therefore in the areas where australian government is regarded undemocratic - in the hereditary control of the monarch and appointments of the governor-general - it can certainly be regarded `` broken '' . this does not mean all of australian government is broken and certainly most of it `` works '' but those undemocratic things that are `` broken '' can and should be changed by adopt a republican form of government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the australia monarchy is `` broken '' in so much as it is undemocratic . <eos>
