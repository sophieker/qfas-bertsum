<s> free speech : is military recruiting consistent with free speech ? <eos>

<s> the bill of rights and constitution in many countries protects the rights of citizens to free speech . it does not protect the right of the government or military to free speech . it is wrong therefore for military recruiters to claim free speech rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> free speech applies to citizens not govt/military . <eos>
