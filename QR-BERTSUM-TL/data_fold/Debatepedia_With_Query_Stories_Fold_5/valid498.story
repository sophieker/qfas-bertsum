<s> practicality : are hybrids vehicle practical ? <eos>

<s> owner of hybrids need not change their behavior in any way when speeding hybrid electric vehicles . these vehicles still taking gasoline from stations and operate from the driver 's stand-point in exactly the same way as ordinary gasoline vehicles . this makes hybrids easy for consumers to adopt . <eos>

@highlight

<s> operate a hybrid is the same as a normal gasoline vehicle . <eos>
