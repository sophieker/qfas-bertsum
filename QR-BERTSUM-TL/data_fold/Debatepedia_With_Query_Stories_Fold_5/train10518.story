<s> efficacy : are sanctions a faulty policy in the effort to democratize cuba ? <eos>

<s> sanctions are a good lever to influence cuban political leaders toward liberalization . while this may not be achievable with castro it is certainly possible with the leaders that follow castro . sanctions have more potential to influence post-castro cuban leaders because these leaders will be less able to resist the public outcry against the government actions in cuba that have led to the existence of these sanctions . therefore the liberalizing objective of sanctions are much more likely to succeed with the next cuban leaders and so they should be sustained so that they can be used effectively in this context . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sanctions should persist to leverage cuban leaders that follow castro <eos>
