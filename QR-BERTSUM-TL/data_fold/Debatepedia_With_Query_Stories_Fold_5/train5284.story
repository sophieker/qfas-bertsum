<s> health : is a vegetarian diets healthy for humans ? <eos>

<s> food safety and hygiene are very importance for everyone and government should act to ensure that high standards are in place . and just as meat production can raise health issues so does the arable farming of plants example include gm crops and worry about pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables . none of this means that we should stop eating meat just that we should ensure all food is produced in a safe and healthier way <eos>

@highlight

<s> vegetarian food have as many healthcare risks as animal foods . <eos>
