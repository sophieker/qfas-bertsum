<s> war on terror : is it wrong to think the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> we were already targets . the attacks on new york and washington of september # th # took place well before the start of the iraq war and other al-qaeda attacks and plots against coalition countries took place before # . furthermore more recent attacks in indonesia and france have shown that even countries opposed to the iraq war are not safe from islamic terrorists . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the iraq war has not made us more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than before <eos>
