<s> powers : does the $ # b bailout give reasonable power to we treasury ? <eos>

<s> the constitution of the united states is designed to allow congress to give major power to the executive branch in this case the department of treasury in order to respond easily and definitively to crises . the # financial crisis is a good example of a situation in which congress is justification in granted the secretary of the treasury with $ # billion to forestall what some fear would be the next great depression . this is appropriate and constitutional not least because it is necessary in the preservation of the union . <eos>

@highlight

<s> financial crisis requires and justifies strong executive powers . <eos>
