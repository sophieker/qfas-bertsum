<s> churches and state : does the monarchies violate separation of churches and state ? <eos>

<s> while many argue that the monarchy in australia is unconstitutional due to its connection with the anglican churches this erroneously assumes that the constitutional states a separation of churches and state . it does n't . therefore any anglican churches influence in australia is actually not at odds with the constitution . so at leas the monarchy 's anglican connection is not create a constitutional crisis in australia . as to whether a separation between churches and state should exist ( as opposed to the current policy of `` neutrality '' ) that is a question that has nothing to do with the crown 's policies and can not be held against it ; it is a question about the australian constitution . <eos>

<s> australia constitution does not separate of church and state ; monarchies is o.k . <eos>
