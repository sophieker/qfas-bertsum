<s> morality : is prostitution morally acceptable ? <eos>

<s> there is no biblical basis for the anti-sexual traditions taught by tradition bound christian churches . the only prostitutes condemned in the bible are those who were priests and priestesses to other gods . israel s neighbors practiced a fertility religion in which prostitution was part of the worship . this led naturally to describing worship of other gods as prostitution . <eos>

@highlight

<s> common prostitution is not a biblical conflict <eos>
