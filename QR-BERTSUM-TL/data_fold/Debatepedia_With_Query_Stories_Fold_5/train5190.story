<s> security : is regional conscription important to regional security ? <eos>

<s> conscripts will not last as long nor be as combat reliable in the battlefield as compared to a real soldier who is well-trained to do both . these 'conscripts ' ( candidates ) are only given the basic training of how to wielded a gun and aim but that short-lived training will never prepare them to readily pull the trigger to end someone 's life therefore lowering their toure because of the uncertainties they pose as soldiers . furthermore soldiers undergo years of vigorous physical exercises to constantly improve their physical shape for the merciless battlefield . the candidates however only have but a few months of such training at a lower magnitude and this can not be sufficient in preparing them for battle . <eos>

@highlight

<s> conscripts ever as great as professional troops <eos>
