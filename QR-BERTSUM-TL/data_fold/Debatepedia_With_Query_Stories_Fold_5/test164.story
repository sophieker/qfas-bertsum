<s> global warming : can hydropower help cuts emission fight global warming ? <eos>

<s> the world energy councils hydroelectric database show that hydroelectric is presently generating about # # twh ( terrawatt hours or millions of megawatt hours annually ) . if we include both high head ( hydropower dams ) and high head ( run-of-the-river micro plants ) systems using current technologies the world can probably economically generate almost # # twh annually . [ # ] this means that hydroelectric could move from its current position of supply roughly # % of all electricity demand globally to supplying upwards of # % . some argue that `` we have enough economically usable river water resources to generate virtually # % of current global electrical demand . '' [ # ] this is a very important conclusion as it means that hydroelectric is a viable long-term # -emissions alternative to coal the biggest <eos>

@highlight

<s> hydropower is capable of scaling to fully replace coal . <eos>
