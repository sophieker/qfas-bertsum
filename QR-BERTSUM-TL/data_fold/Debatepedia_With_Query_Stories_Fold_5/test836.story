<s> free speech : is military recruiting consistently with free speech ? <eos>

<s> the military has unmatched resources to dedicating to marketing and recruiting . no recruiters from other industries can matches either . this is why once again military classes are categorically different in term of how aggressive they can pursue recruits . <eos>

@highlight

<s> non-military recruiters lacking similar resources for recruiting . <eos>
