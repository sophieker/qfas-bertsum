<s> players : is playoff in interests of player health/academics ? <eos>

<s> michael shull . `` bcs no more : college football needs playoffs to eliminate the bs . '' college sports fans . : `` so there you have it a # -team playoff format . critics will begin with arguments like 'that s too those games for these student athletes ' or a focus on the academics and the hardships these college students would be under if they advance to the # -team playoff and keep playing . my counters to that is that academics did not decide the # th game that was recently added to everyone s schedule in the football bowl subdivision and academics don t seem to matter in breaking the texas-oklahoma-texas technology debate for the big # north title and big # championship debate so quit saying you <eos>

<s> opponent of rf playoffs health about money not academics <eos>
