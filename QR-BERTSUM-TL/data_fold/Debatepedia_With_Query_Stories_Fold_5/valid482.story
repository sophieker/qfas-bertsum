<s> pesticides : do gm foods require fewer pesticides ? <eos>

<s> `` what 's wrong with gm ? '' . catholic institute for international relations ( ciir ) - `` advocates of gm crops argue that gm crops are good for the environment since they will reduce the amount of agrochemicals ( pesticides and herbicides ) that need to be used in crop production . however opponents of gm crops believe that these crops are a threat to the environment . the claim that gm crops require fewer herbicides and pesticides has been proved wrong . they require fewer chemicals than conventional crops in the short term but gradually they need significantly more .
