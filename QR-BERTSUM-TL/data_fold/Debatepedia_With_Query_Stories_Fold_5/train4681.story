<s> jesus and the messianic old testament prophecies <eos>

<s> christ 's life was described in great detail by the prophets and many of the fulfilments of those prophecies could not possibly have been arranged by a con man . how could jesus have chosen his town of birth betrayal price his method of execution ( crucifixion was a execution method that no one in their right mind would chose and dying on a tree as prophesied was in jewish tradition viewed as probably the most ignominious way to die ) his betrayer that he would be mocked spat on wounded ( but without breaking any bones ) and would have his clothes gambled for in the lead up to his death ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> the messianic prophecies clearly apply to christ and none other . <eos>
