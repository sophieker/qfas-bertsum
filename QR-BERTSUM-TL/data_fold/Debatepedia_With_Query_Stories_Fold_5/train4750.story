<s> charging : should we instead of banning plastic bag charges customers money for them ? <eos>

<s> if each plastic bag cost - saying # cents then those would not using them in large amount because they are paying . if someone mall twice a week using five plastic bags each shop and the bags cost # c each they would realize that that would cost over $ # a year so they would or not using as many or this may be an incentive to reuse plastic bags . <eos>

@highlight

<s> charging for plastic bag would discourage people from using them in small amounts . <eos>
