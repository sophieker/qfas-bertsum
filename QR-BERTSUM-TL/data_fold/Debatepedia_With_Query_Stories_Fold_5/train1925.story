<s> benefits : what debate surrounding civil union vs. gay marriage benefits ? <eos>

<s> paul varnell . `` for civil unions '' . chicago free press . march # # : `` # . civil unions in other states unlike those in massachusetts and vermont would probably include a smaller number of benefits and entitlements than marriage making them far from equal . but however harder this is to swallow here again the point is to get a process started . even if lessor variations on civil unions offer adequate benefits ( e.g . hospital visitation ) it is almost inevitable that as legislators and the public become comfortable with gay couples in formalized relationships they will feel more comfortable adding additional benefits over time . [ ... ] that model has worked but in california where gay couples have obtained more and more benefits with each legislative session . <eos>
