<s> individual rights : does the individual have the right to consume drugs ? <eos>

<s> the state has the authority vested in it by the people to protecting individuals from doing harms to themselves and others . the need to assume this responsibility is especially heightened if the individual is not aware of the risks or is addict and thus not making inform choices . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the states is justified in protecting persons from their own drug-consumption . <eos>
