<s> economics : can the la have a higher impact on poverty than climate change ? <eos>

<s> un cash can go straight to the bad in the form of aid directly addressing a clear human need . cash that goes toward the problem of climate change does not have such a direct one-another as the effects on human needs are very indirect ( protecting beings from change in temperature and the possibility of negative effects in the future ) . and of course all efforts by the un to combat climate change may do nothing to prevent its eventual occurrence . because poverty reduction entails lower risks and more direct bang-for-buck the un should prioritize it over climate change . <eos>
