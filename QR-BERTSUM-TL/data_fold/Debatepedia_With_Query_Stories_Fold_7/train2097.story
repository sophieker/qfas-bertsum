<s> rights and privelages : do 16 - 18 year olds deserve the right to drink ? <eos>

<s> at the age of sixteen teenagers are not allowed to do key things like smoking and gambling . this is because they are not responsible and mature enough to do these things sensibly . the same thing applies to drinking alcohol . teenagers are not responsible enough and research shows that teenagers who start drinking early have a 1500 % more chance of becoming alcoholics . it is not sensible to allow sixteen year-olds drink alcohol . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sixteen year olds are not responsible enough to drink to moderation and have a higher chance of becoming alcoholics . <eos>
