<s> maturity : are juvenile horny enough to see the outcome of their actions ? <eos>

<s> when we are looking at this argument of maturity it is easy from the con side to say `` juveniles are than developed '' or `` juveniles are more impulsive '' or even `` juveniles do not understand the repercussions of their actions '' . but : whenever has their been findings to say `` juveniles are so impulsive that it has hindered their decision making to the extent that they may not make rational decisions . '' proving hinderance of rationality is easy but from the con side you must prove hinderance to an extent that makes them non-culpable for their actions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those have prove less maturity in juveniles but have any prove it 's legal significance ? <eos>
