<s> convention : is it important that party leaders attend national convention ? <eos>

<s> one of the concerns that led to the creation of the superdelegate system was that the party leadership was not effectively represented at the national convention . but the convention is where the party agenda is traditionally debated and re-established in every election cycle so the presence of the party leadership is crucial . if superdelegates did not exist the party leadership would not be adequately involved in the shaping of the party agenda at great cost to the future of the democratic party . <eos>
