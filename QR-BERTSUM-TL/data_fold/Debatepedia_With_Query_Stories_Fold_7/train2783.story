<s> adult health : is a circumcised penis healthier in adulthood ? <eos>

<s> phimosis is a situation in which the foreskin has difficulty retracting or returning over the head of the penis due to abnormally tight foreskin . this however can be solved by other means than circumcision . in addition doctors often mistaken the natural state of the infants foreskin ( which does not retract until later years ) as phimosis and subsequently mistakenly opt to circumcise the infant . <eos>

@highlight

<s> circumcision is not a good solution to phimosis of foreskin <eos>
