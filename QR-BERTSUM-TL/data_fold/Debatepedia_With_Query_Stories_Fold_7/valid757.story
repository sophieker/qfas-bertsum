<s> economics : is tides electricity robust and viable economically ? <eos>

<s> tidal electricity does not require any fuel . tides rise and fall natural every day and so supply a free source of energy . thus once a tidal electricity plant is built the electricity extract from it is virtually free . this comparing favorably to coal petroleum or nuclear power generation in which fuel must be drilled for or mined ( which takes electricity and money ) filtered or refined ( which takes electricity and money ) transported ( which takes electricity and money ) and burnt for electricity ( which has environmental and subsequent economy costs ) . this means that fuels fuels have a price while tidal electricity is a free electricity source . <eos>
