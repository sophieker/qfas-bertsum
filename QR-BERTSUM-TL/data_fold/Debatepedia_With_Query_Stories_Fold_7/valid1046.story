<s> efficacy : will a bail-out help solving the problem ? <eos>

<s> felix salmon . `` why the greek bail-out won t work . '' reuters . may # # : `` the fact is that the bail-out package really doesn t address the problem which is another of liquidity rather than liquidity . the european loans are being extended at about # % which while much lower than market rates is still not high enough to make something approaching a dent in greece s debt dynamics . and by the time the bail-out package is exhausted if greece even gets that far its debt-to-gdp ratio will be significantly higher than it is right now thank to both a rising numerator and a declining denominator .
