<s> crime : does an assault weapon bans reducing crime and save lives ? <eos>

<s> those guns that remained openly available after the # assault weapons ban were efficiently as lethal as the weapons that were banning under the legislation . this is largely because simple adjustment to assault weapons allowed exemptions from the ban . and it is clearly that those of the weapons used in the most deadly atrocities such as the columbine or virginia tech atrocities in the united states were not banning by the assault weapons law . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assault weapon banned in # were not unique deadly <eos>
