<s> dignity of life : does abortion uphold the `` dignity of life '' ? <eos>

<s> no human beings are entirely different class . we are called not to murder human life not acorns . abortionists focus only on stage development and ignore the specialness and reverence we should have for even a tiny ( but growing ) human life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no one argues that an acorn or even an animal fetus has a sanctity or rights . <eos>
