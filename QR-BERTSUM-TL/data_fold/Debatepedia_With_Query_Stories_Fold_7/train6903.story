<s> international relations : is sending humans to space good for international relations ? <eos>

<s> sending humans into space or to other planets so that they can erect the flag of a particular nation is a distinctly nationalistic act and one that is likely to create aggressive 'races ' in the future just as it has before . china s manned programme is openly intended to challenge the us dominance of space for the communist regime s huge propaganda benefit . george w. bush s pledge to boost spending on nasa and to restart the manned mission to mars programme was a direct response . this is damaging not only because of the potential for space race conflicts to escalate into greater international hostility but also because of the way such races could result in the militarization of space <eos>

@highlight

<s> flag-staking is occurring in space and spread nationalistic sentiments . <eos>
