<s> `` encyclopedia '' : is wikipedia an `` encyclopedia '' or is this too strong a word ? <eos>

<s> john willinsky reported a preference for online sources over print sources - `` only four out of the 100 entries relied exclusively on print sources ( and they were single source entries ) while print sources turned up in a dozen entries in total ... online sources were clearly favored among contributors as the greater interconnectivity which the internet represents compared to print culture also forms part of wikipedia 's quality as an instrument of knowledge and learning . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia is online and interactive unlike other encyclopedias <eos>
