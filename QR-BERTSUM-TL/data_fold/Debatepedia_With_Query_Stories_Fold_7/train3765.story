<s> socialized medicine : is it wrong to call single-payer systems socialized medicine ? <eos>

<s> it 's answer is meaningless to which system provides the most benefits to the most people . it 's a semantic argument which will hang more on specific definitions or words that anything resembling rational health care debate . having said that - the answer is `` yes '' . socializing anything involves taking individual decisions and `` socializing '' any negative effects to the community instead of limiting it to the individual . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` is it wrong to call single-payer systems socialized medicine ? '' is another inconsequential question . <eos>
