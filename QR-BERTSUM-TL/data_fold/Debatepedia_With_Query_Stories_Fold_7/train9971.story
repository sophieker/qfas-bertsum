<s> is it justifiable to give away the national sovereign of the europe states ? <eos>

<s> there indeed are some burning issues and problems that can t be tackled without international cooperation ( such as global warming spread of diseases ... ) . international cooperation effectively meaning giving authority and power to a legislative body a councils or an organizations - which meaning that the concept of national state is watered down . <eos>

@highlight

<s> international cooperation is sometimes of higher importance . <eos>
