<s> sex-specific diseases : is choosing the sex of child a good way to avoid these diseases ? <eos>

<s> embryo genetic diagnosis involve the development of embryos outside the uterus which are then tested for gender . one or two of the desired sexuality are then implanted in the womb . those that are not of the desired sexuality or are surpluses to requirements are destroyed ( typically over a dozen embryos are used to select a single one to be implanted ) . a human life has been created with the express purpose of being destroyed . this is one form of abortion only the conception is deliberate . ultimately it will be these technologies and not renews that is used last whilst the latter has a # % accuracy rate if a girl is desired ( itself a lower result than genetic diagnosis ) its accuracy falls <eos>

@highlight

<s> medical benefits are outweighs by medical costs . <eos>
