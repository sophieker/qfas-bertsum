<s> service compatibility ? is homosexuality compatible with military service ? <eos>

<s> a white female us military officer said according to `` gays and lesbians in the military '' : `` i feel as long as they can perform the jobs required of them they should be allowed in the military . what goes on behind closed doors is none of the military 's business . as long as gays and lesbians keep their private lives out of the workplace i foresee no problems . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> gays that keep personal lives private are compatible with military <eos>
