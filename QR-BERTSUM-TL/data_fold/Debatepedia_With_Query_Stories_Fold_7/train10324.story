<s> military : is an individuals right to a handgun important to civilian preparedness ? <eos>

<s> some argue that one of the main purpose of the # nd amendment is to enable citizen to train with weapon so that they are prepared for military services or the draft . if this is the case and if the military is fully capable of supplying citizen with guns upon entering the services or being drafted then it is appropriate to restricting citizen gun-use to training purpose at guns ranges . in this case there is no need for citizen to own guns but only the need for citizen to train with them such that they are fully prepared to serve militarily . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if # nd amendments aims only at military preparedness guns should be available for training only <eos>
