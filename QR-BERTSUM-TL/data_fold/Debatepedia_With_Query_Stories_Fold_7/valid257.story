<s> child protections : do full-body scanner protect rights of minors ? <eos>

<s> arthur weinreb . `` full-body scanners ; it 's just common sense . '' canada free press . february # # : `` minors should be scanned and to links these scans to child sex is ludicrous . police officers routinely possess child pornography all the time . not only do they possess it but they distribute it to prosecutor who further distribute it to defense lawyers . then the prosecutor further distribute it to judges who show juries . for some reason these people aren t considered to have committed criminal act because they are doing what they do to protect the public . just like those who operate full body scanners are doing .

<s> secure scans of child are not pornography <eos>
