<s> legislative process : is the filibuster valuable to the legislative process ? <eos>

<s> george kenney . `` kill the filibuster rule . '' los angeles times . march 5 2009 : `` during a time when the nation will need a lot of legislation quickly it seems absurd that the senate binds itself to an obsolete supermajority rule requiring 60 votes to end a filibuster and force a vote . what 's so magic about the number 60 ? why should 41 senators -- coincidentally the current number of republicans -- be able to block public policy indefinitely ? '' <eos>
