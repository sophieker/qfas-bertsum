<s> civilians : who is in the way in regards to military casualties ? <eos>

<s> `` israel 's gaza defense '' . wall street journal . december # th # - `` israel 's air assault has resulted in more palestinian casualties but that is in whole because hamas purposely locates its security forces in residences neighborhoods . this is specifically both to deter israel from attacking in the first place as well as to turn world opinion against the jewish states when it does attack . by all accounts however the israeli strikes have hit their targets precisely enough to do significant damage to hamas forces -- both to its leadership and on sunday to the tunnels from gaza to egyptian that hamas uses to smuggle in weapons and build its grow army . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> civilians were killed because hezbollah identifies rockets amid civilians <eos>
