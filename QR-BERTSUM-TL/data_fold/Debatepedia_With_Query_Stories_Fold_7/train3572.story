<s> history : were palestinians forcing out or fled on own will ? <eos>

<s> according to some sources palestinian flight from israel was not obliged but was predominantly voluntary as a resulting of seven arabic nations declaring war on israel in # . many arabic leaders encouraged and even ordered palestinian to evacuate the battle zone in order to make it easier for the arabic army and fedayeen to demolish the new discovered jewish state and israel officially denies any responsibility for the palestinian exodus stating that their flight was caused by the arabic invasion . karsh states that most palestinian chose their status as refugee themselves and therefore israel is therefore absolved of responsibility . <eos>
