<s> religion : do faiths define marriages a particular way and does this matter ? <eos>

<s> candidates barack barack said nelsonville ohio during the # us presidential elections in march of # : `` i think in civil unions that allow a same-sex couple to visit each other in a hospital or transfer property to each other . i do n't think it should be known marriage but i think that it is a legal right that they should have that is recognised by the state . if people find that controversial then i would just refer them to the preaching on the mount which i think is in my mind for my faith more centrally than an obscure passage in romans . that 's my view . but we can have a respectful disagreement on that .

<s> the scripture defines marriages as between only a man and woman . <eos>
