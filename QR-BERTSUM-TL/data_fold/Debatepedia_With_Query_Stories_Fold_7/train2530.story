<s> social : would legalization entail heavy societal costs ? <eos>

<s> if we want to produce a better society there is some room for `` big brother '' regulations to prevent citizens from doing harm to themselves . this is particularly appropriate in the context of some individuals not having a `` choice '' in the matter in the sense that they grow up in an environment that exposes them to marijuana and in which they do n't have any knowledge of marijuana 's costs . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marijuana is the drug for life 's losers <eos>
