<s> elephant populations : have elephant populations revived as a result of the ban and is this a reason to relax or <eos>

<s> although elephant populations in southern africa are viable and increasing this is not the case elsewhere in africa nor is it true of the wild asian elephant populations of south asia . no test can reveal where worked ivory originated nor which species it was from so lifting the trading ban would make it easy for poachers everywhere to sell ivory increasing their profits and their motivation to kill more elephants . the corruption widespread in africa and parts of asia would make it easy for poachers to mask the illegal origins of their ivory passing it off as legitimate .

@highlight

<s> increases in elephant populations are only occurring in some places making the un ban on ivory trading still relevant : <eos>
