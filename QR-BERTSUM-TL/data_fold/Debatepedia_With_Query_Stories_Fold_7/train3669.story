<s> james a. dorn . `` ending tax socialism '' . cato institute . # sept. # - `` if we let constitutional principles be eroded by majority rule in the name of social justice then both freedom and true justice will be lost . progressive taxation is not a virtue but a vice . it presumes that the property rights of the wealthy are not as sacred as the property rights of the poor and that the values of the majority are superior to the rights of the minority . '' <eos>
