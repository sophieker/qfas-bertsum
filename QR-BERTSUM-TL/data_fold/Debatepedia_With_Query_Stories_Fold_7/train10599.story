<s> mitt romney . `` stop start . '' boston.com . december # # : `` does the treaty provide gaping loopholes that russia could use to escape nuclear weapon limit entirely ? yes . for example multiple warhead missiles bombers are counted under the treaty as only one warhead . while we currently have more bombers than the russians they have embarked on new programs for long-range bombers and for air-launched nuclear cruise missiles . thus it is no surprise that russia is happy to undercount missiles on bombers .
