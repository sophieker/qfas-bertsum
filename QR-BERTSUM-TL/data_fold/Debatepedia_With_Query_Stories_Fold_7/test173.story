<s> health : is marijuana fairly harmless health-wise or even intellectually beneficial ? <eos>

<s> there is no evidence that marijuana physically addictive . while it may be emotionally addictive in the mind that those like it and want to do it again this is bit various than alcohol . but definitely cigarettes are more addictive than marijuana . and since cigarettes are physically addictive and yet legal should addictiveness really be a barometer for a substance 's illegality ? no . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marijuana is not addicting <eos>
