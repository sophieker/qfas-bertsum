<s> community integration : does arranged marriage trap the community integration ? <eos>

<s> afro-caribbean and jewish people in western europe both maintain a distinct cultural life while taking part fully in the life of this country . in fact their cultural contributions are one of the most valuable additions to the societies in which they live . the basis of multiculturalism is to understand the social and even economic value that can accrue from having people with different perspectives and traditions living together . furthermore in the second and third generations of immigrant families from the subcontinent we can already see barriers breaking down so that there is greater understanding and cross-fertilisation of the ideas these immigrant communities have brought . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is not just groups practising arranged marriage who maintain cohesive communities . <eos>
