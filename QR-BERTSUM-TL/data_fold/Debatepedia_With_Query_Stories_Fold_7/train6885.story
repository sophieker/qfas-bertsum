<s> jean francois-cope . `` tearing away the veil . '' new york times . may # th # : `` in both france and the united states we recognize that individual liberties can not exist without individual responsibilities . this acknowledgment is the basis of all our political rights . we are free as long as we are responsible individuals who can be held accountable for our actions before our peers . but the niqab and burqa represent a refusal to exist as a person in the eyes of others . the person who wears one is no longer identifiable ; she is a shadow among others lacking individuality avoiding responsibility .
