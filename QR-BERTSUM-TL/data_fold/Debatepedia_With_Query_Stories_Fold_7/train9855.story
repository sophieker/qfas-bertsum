<s> democracy : is seating the delegates necessary in preserving democracy ? <eos>

<s> this means that the democratic voters in this election were simply not give a ballot that could ever live up to democratic election standards . it is necessary with any ballot that the primary candidates ' names appear on the ballot . both obama and clinton 's names were absent . there is not chance that the results of an election that did not include the names of the candidates on the ballots could be used to later allot delegates for the democratic convention . <eos>

@highlight

<s> michigan ballots unfairly contained clinton 's name but not obama 's <eos>
