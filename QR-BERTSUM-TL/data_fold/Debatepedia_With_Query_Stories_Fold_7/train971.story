<s> economics : do sociology favor art subsidies overall ? <eos>

<s> even if governments subsidies of the arts occasionally produced most and acclaimed artistic successes these will always be too infrequent to justify wasted public money on a great many more flops . just as governments have proved to be very poor at centrally-directed economic plan they are unlikely to be any better at centrally-directed artistic planning . instead they are more likely to channels resources wastefully stifling more creative and potentially most endeavours elsewhere . and remember money wasted on the arts is money that could be spent on schools pension and hospitals . <eos>

<s> governments subsidies will be wastefully wasted on `` artsy '' flops . <eos>
