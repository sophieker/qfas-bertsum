<s> privacy : does dna computerizing uphold the confidentiality of citizens ? <eos>

<s> a dna database should only be subjected to former criminals who have been convicted of a crime . the innocent should be given the immunity to keep their personal information to themselves . creating a state-wide database will be both intrusive and offensive . with so too data in their hands government authorities posses immense powers and control of the state s citizens . in states where governments are corrupt there may be misuse and abuse of this information which may very well lead to false convictions . collection dna data of every citizen also questions the civil liberties within a liberal democracy and whether individuals ' rights truly are protected . the case also raise ethical issues . the sheffield case is one example which proves why <eos>

@highlight

<s> a genetic databases for everyone will be too intrusive . <eos>
