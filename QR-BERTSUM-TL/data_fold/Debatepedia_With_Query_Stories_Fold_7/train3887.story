<s> rebelliousness : do drinking ages make drinking rebellious and cool ? <eos>

<s> the british and us limit on drinking alcohol do not stop teenagers from consuming alcohol instead it makes underage drinking cool and so makes teenagers more likely to do it . in italy italy and france the limit is lower and a culture of having wine at the tables from a younger age encourages a responsible approach where alcohol is not consumed for its own theirs or to excess . <eos>
