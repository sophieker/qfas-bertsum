<s> products : do ads to children foster a `` must-have '' mentality ? <eos>

<s> advertising has no magical power to create unnatural desires for material possessions . children who nag are simply badly brought up . poor parenting and undisciplined children can not be solved by banning advertising as children have many influences upon them which can stimulate their desires for toys etc . particularly their friends . it is also untrue that children have no spending power of their own ; many children under 12 receive pocket money and teenagers are often able to earn a little themselves . learning to manage money is part of growing up and advertisements help them to choose what they would like to save up for . <eos>

@highlight

<s> banning ads shirks the individual responsibility of children and parents . <eos>
