<s> deterrence : are prosecution important for deterring potential war crimes ? <eos>

<s> it is doubtful if genocide such as this is based on rational calculations ; the diverting of resources into the final solution was a major reason why hitler lost the war . in the same way war murderers are unlikely to be dissuade by legal threat such as these ; they are driven by a fanatic hatred not commonly sense . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those that commit war crimes are frequently irrational and would be dissuade by visible prosecutions : <eos>
