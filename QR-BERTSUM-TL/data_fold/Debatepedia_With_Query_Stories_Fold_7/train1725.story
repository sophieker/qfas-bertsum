<s> jim gilchrist mba cpa founder and president of the minuteman project in a be # # global politician interview titled `` jim gilchrist of minuteman project on immigration terror elections '' : `` i m pro-deportation or if you want to use a happier word pro-repatriation . you can not have a defeatist attitude towards the problem and have a solution . the repatriation of illegals must begin with a recognition of the problem and a plan . we be be called names but the names our grandchildren will call we will be worse when they have to live in a destroyed country . there must be a multi-faceted approach including arresting illegals and also cutting off social welfare program to them .
