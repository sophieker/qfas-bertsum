<s> any proposal to shifts to a single-payer universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry . this is a highly disruptive act that would involve massive jobs loss . the advantage of a mixed public-private universal health care system is that it is not as damaging and damaging in this way . it acknowledging the existence of a private health care industries and the need to preserve at least some of the interests of such a massive and important industry . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a mixed private-public systems would preserve existing industries . <eos>
