<s> is prostitutes a criminalized crime ? <eos>

<s> the process of pimp and kidnapping can and should be illegal regardless of the constitutionality of prostitution . we must remember that at one time people were kidnapped from their houses and transported around the sea to work on farms yet none would state that farming should be illegal . further these activities occur because prostitution is illegal and vilified . were that not so more women would likely choose the professions and activities such as kidnapping would become less profitable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> pimp kidnapping porn trade are not inherent to prostitution . <eos>
