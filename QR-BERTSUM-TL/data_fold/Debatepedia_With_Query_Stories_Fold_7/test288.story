<s> todd may . `` the emerging case for a single-state solution '' . counter punch . september # # : `` a first objection might appeal to the motivation for recognizing [ ... ] a jewish state in the first place . [ ... ] that the holocaust proves that european jews deserve protection against the history of hatred against them is undeniable . it does not follow from this that they deserved a state where they would be privileged vis- - vis another people . that idea has more to do with nineteenth-century nationalism than with the internationalism more characteristic of the contemporary world . moreover history has shown the effects of this privileging . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> idea of jewish state in two-state solution is undemocratic <eos>
