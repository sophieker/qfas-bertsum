<s> vandalism : does wikipedia handle vandalism adequately ? <eos>

<s> although cranks do contribute material to wikipedia it 's easy to delete patent nonsense as soon as it appears on the recent changes page . some websites say the first moon landing was staged in a movie studio or describe supposed perpetual motion machines . it is impossible to correct those websites no matter how wrong they are because their authors demands complete control over their work . they fail miserably on wikipedia . because no one owns the information in wikipedia misinformation can be fixed . in the best case cranks who are unable to accept critical editing of their writing will find they have no platform and leave ; those wanting to present their interests in less-biased way become valuable contributors . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia 's consensus models smother cranks and perosek with reasonable minds . <eos>
