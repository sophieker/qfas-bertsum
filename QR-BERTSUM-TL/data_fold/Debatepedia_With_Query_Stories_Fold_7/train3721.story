<s> abuse : is the veto power subject to individual interests ? <eos>

<s> brendan i. koerner . `` can you bypass a u.n. security council veto ? '' . slate.com . march 12 2003 - `` there 's an esoteric maneuver to get around a threatened veto : invoking the obscure u.n. resolution 377 also known as the `` uniting for peace '' resolution . in early 1950 the united states pushed through the resolution as a means of circumventing possible soviet vetoes . the measure states that in the event that the security council can not maintain international peace a matter can be taken up by the general assembly . this procedure has been used 10 times so far most notably in 1956 to help resolve the suez canal crisis . britain and france which were occupying parts of the canal at the time vetoed security council resolutions <eos>
