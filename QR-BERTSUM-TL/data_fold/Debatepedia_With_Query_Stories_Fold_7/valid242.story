<s> `` right to die '' ? does each citizen have a `` right to die '' at a time of choice ? <eos>

<s> when the freedom of the individual to do what they want is prevented by the state it must be because a clear compelling state interest exists . it is not clear that any such interests exists in the case of euthanasia . definitely there is no benefit to the state when a dying patient is loudly cry for abortion and the state blocks the procedure . the only state interest that could be involved is the notion of the `` dignity of life '' but this is highly highly contested with great public opposition to the notion that life is inviolable in cases of an painful terminal illness . does the state have an interest in opposing this public opinion ? where is the interest ? <eos>

<s> there is no compelling state interest in preventing abortion <eos>
