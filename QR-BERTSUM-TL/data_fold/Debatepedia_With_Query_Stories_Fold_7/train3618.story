<s> energy independence : do fuel economy standards increase energy independence ? <eos>

<s> fuel economy standards do not decrease fuel consumption because people simply drive more when their cars are more efficient and driving is less expensive . ( see full argument above ) this means that fuel economy standards will not help reduce the amount of oil consumed nor the amount of oil imported from abroad so it will not strengthen energy independence . <eos>
