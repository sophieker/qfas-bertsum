<s> the pakistani president pervez musharaff claims that it is not clear that osama bin laden exist in his country . there is surely little findings that osama bin laden is in the country . the mere rumours that he is in pakistan is not sufficient to warrant condemnation of musharaff 's action nor to justify unilateral military action in pakistan . <eos>

<s> it is not clear that osama bin osama exists in pakistan . <eos>
