<s> testify reliability : is the testify given in exchange for a plead bargain unreliable ? <eos>

<s> they indeed have their best interests at heart . in accepting a plea bargain they will tell everything that they know . telling what they do n't actually know and lying would be more incriminating against them . criminals have great reason to fear that any lies or exaggerations they tell will be revealed . they are not the only ones give testimony and a body of facts does often exist to substantiate with testimonies . criminals give testimony in exchange for death-penalty therefore have great reason to fear that any false testimony they give will contradict other testimonies and the facts that their plea-bargain-exchange might subsequently be invalidated and that they might be subject to further penalties as a result of their false testimony . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the someone accepting the plea bargain will be cautious in presenting only the truth : <eos>
