<s> decision-making : is socialism superior to other form of government ? <eos>

<s> a truly socialist society would be much more versatile and flexibility than any capitalist one . since there would be no classes and decisions would be made by the people they would be able to make decisions that would best avert the crisis for the average people not the elites ( like in capitalism or fake socialism ) . and since decision make would be truly democratic it would be quick to change things about the society if everyone wanted it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> communism can effectively respond to crises . <eos>
