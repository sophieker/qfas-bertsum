<s> duty ? does a citizens have a duty to serving their country ? <eos>

<s> alan reynolds . `` we do n't draft firemen . '' washington time cato . may # nd # : `` there were # firefighters killed at the world trade center on september # # . nobody then suggested the fact that these men were pay professionals detracted from their heroism . nobody worried whether the relative number of whites blacks or japanese firefighters was fair and balanced . nationwide another # firefighters died in # -- a typical yearly loss . from # to # an average of # law enforcement officers also were killed each year in the line of duty . if compulsory services is such a fair and reasonable idea why do n't mr. hagel mr. rangel and others of their ilk favor drafting people to be firemen and cops ? '' <eos>
