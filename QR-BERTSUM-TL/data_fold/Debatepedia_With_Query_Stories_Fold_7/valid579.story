<s> offensive ? is the ground zero mosque offensive or respectful ? <eos>

<s> islam has built mosques on conquered territory before . cordoba 's mosque in spain is a good example where the moores built a mosque as a sign of victories in spain in the 11th and 12th centuries . the ground zero mosque is no different . <eos>

@highlight

<s> building mosques is a symbol of muslim conquest <eos>
