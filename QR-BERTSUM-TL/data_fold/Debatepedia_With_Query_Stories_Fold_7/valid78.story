<s> taxpayer money : is tax justified to re-coup taxpayer bailouts ? <eos>

<s> jeffrey miron . `` bailing out the banks was wrong but new tax wo n't make it right . '' investor 's business daily . january 14 2010 : `` the tax will not fall solely or even mainly on its desired political target the shareholders and highly paid executives of large financial firms . the true burden of a tax often lands far from its intended target as the target attempts to shift the burden . [ ... ] in this case higher taxes mean higher costs and therefore higher prices so customers ( borrowers ) will bear some of the burden of the tax . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> bank tax will be passed on to consumers <eos>
