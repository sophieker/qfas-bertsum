<s> government legitimacy : does government have legitimate authority to censor rap ? <eos>

<s> even if one accepts the argument for some limited form of government censorship to protect public morals this needs to be very precisely and conservatively defined to avoid the slippery slope towards creeping totalitarianism . allowing censorship of popular culture on grounds that the lyrics are mildly subversive is unwelcome as it incorporates a very expansive view of the proper ambit of government regulation . this issue is properly the concern of parents who should take more interest in and responsibility for the music ( and films tv internet use ) to which their children are exposed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> government censorship is a dangerous form of statist control . <eos>
