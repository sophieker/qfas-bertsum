<s> social : are carbon emission trades systems socially beneficial fair ? <eos>

<s> emissions trading does not make the environment and emissions into properties and place all power in the hands of the markets . rather government is in charge of establishing the system through democratic processes and settings `` caps '' . the public therefore are in charge of cap-and-trade systems . it is wrong therefore to argue that the environment is being came into private properties and that too much power is being put into the hands of private companies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> emissions trades involves sufficient democratic control <eos>
