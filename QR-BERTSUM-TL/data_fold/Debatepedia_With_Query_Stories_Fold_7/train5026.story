<s> legitimacy : was the invasion of afghanistan illegal/illegitimate ? is continued it illegal/illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> many knowledge reports and expert opinions globally corroborated the analyses that iraq had wmd prior to the # invasion . leaders and governments can not be held legally culpable for having trusted for this bad knowledge and analysis . this means that the invasion of iraq was not really illegal nor that withdraw from iraq should be encourage on such a basis . <eos>

@highlight

<s> that iraq did not actually have wmd highlights worse intelligence not illegal acts . <eos>
