<s> emergency contact : in the event of a school-wide emergency ( a shooting etc . ) ? <eos>

<s> i have personally been in this situations and it wo n't starting a panic . we had a bomb threat in our school in fall of # . we were all moved to our practice football fields and most of us proceeded to calling our parents and you know what no panics started . besides no parents could get to the school because all the roads were blocking so the police had free access . i really do n't think they pose a threat . as for the danger described in the no section the bomb has to have a special detonater for that to work . <eos>

@highlight

<s> students cell phone using during emergencies will not causes panic . <eos>
