<s> feasibility : is providing internet as a right feasible ? <eos>

<s> if the internet is a right not only make it a right would be hard providing internet access is downright impossible . for example south korea is the most internetly connected nation in the world but we only achieved this because of our country 's size ( which is huge as indiana ) . what about poor africans or people lives in the jungles of the amazon ? what about chinese people who internet access is blocking by its government ? north korea iran other countries where internet access is restricted ? with today 's intractable problems like drugs there 's no need to create another one . <eos>

@highlight

<s> just another problems created <eos>
