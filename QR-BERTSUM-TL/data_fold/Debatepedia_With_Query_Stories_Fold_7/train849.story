<s> designer babies ? can `` genetic screening '' avoid falling into the feared trap of people creating `` designer babies '' ? can it be separated <eos>

<s> [ # ] the intention with genetic screening is not to produce a superior race . the main intention is rather to afford parents the capacity to produce more healthy children for the sake of the parents and the children themselves . contrary to many fears associated with such eugenics movement as the nazis there would be no state involvement in the selection process nationalism would not be a factor nor racism ( and genocide could not become involved ) . if `` genetic screening '' can be called `` eugenics '' ( a loosely defined term ) it should be clarified as not involve any horrendous forms of `` eugenics '' and this association should not discredit the practice without qualification as to why . <eos>

@highlight

<s> everybody is forcing parents to perform `` genetic screening '' which counters its association with social-planning eugenics . <eos>
