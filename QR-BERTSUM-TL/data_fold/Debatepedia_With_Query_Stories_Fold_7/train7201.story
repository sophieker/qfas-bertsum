<s> due punishment : does the penalty fits the crime ? <eos>

<s> we have done away with the barbaric practice of using mental pain or disfigurement as a punishments for other crimes in favoured of a more enlightened system of reforming the offender in prison . what would happen if the suspect was later acquitted ? the process could not be reversed . when the died penalty was applied many people were discovered to be innocent subsequent to their execution the same could happen here . imprisonment and counselling to prevent re-offence would be far more effective . <eos>

@highlight

<s> laws functions on terms of non-physical punishment for crimes . <eos>
