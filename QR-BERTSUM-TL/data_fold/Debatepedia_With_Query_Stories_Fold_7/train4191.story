<s> accomplishments : did barack obama deserve the peace prize based on his accomplishments ? <eos>

<s> robert reich . `` why obama should not have received the peace prize -- yet . '' huffington post . october # # : `` i 'd rather obama had won it after congress agreed to substantial cuts in greenhouse gases comparable to what europe is proposing after he brought palestinians and israelis together to accept a two-state solution after he got the united states out of afghanistan and reduced the nuclear arm 's threat between pakistan and india or after he was well on the way to eliminating the world 's stockpile of nuclear weapons . any one of these would have been worthy of global praise . perhaps the nobel committee can give him half the prize now and withhold the other half until he accomplishes one or more <eos>

<s> barack obama has not accomplished enough to warrant peace prize . <eos>
