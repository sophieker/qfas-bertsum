<s> economics : is pluralism better than assimilation economically ? <eos>

<s> when a migrant goes to this country their living requirements increase by an average # % according to john borjas one of america 's leading experts on migration . a country should set a precedent and act in an internationalist way . you are improving someones living requirements and providing your own do not drop then it is beneficial . improving the living requirements of a migrant will also help society cohesion . in theory if the migrant prefers the new requirements of living they are unlikely to wage war against the host nation and hence terrorism is made less likely . <eos>

@highlight

<s> pluralism is economically beneficial to immigrants . <eos>
