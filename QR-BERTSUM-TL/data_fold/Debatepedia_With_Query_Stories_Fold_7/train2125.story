<s> status quo : could an amendments simply clarify the reality that japan 's `` defensive '' military force is no different than an `` offensive '' <eos>

<s> all weaponry is capable of both . japan is in reality heavily armed albeit in the form of a national self defense force ( sdf ) . she retains land sea and air forces which would seems to be contrary to the constitution but every attempt to deploy them against anything other than an attack on japan soils requires endless delay and constitution debate . a constitution revision would bring welcome clarity to the situation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the distinction between defensive and defensive capabilities is an ludicrous one : <eos>
