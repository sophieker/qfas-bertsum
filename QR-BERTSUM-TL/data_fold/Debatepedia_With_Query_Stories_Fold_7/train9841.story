<s> is 'animal research ' a bad excuse for keeping animals in zoos ? <eos>

<s> as above we should take a 'both-and ' approach rather than an 'either-or ' approach . animals can and should be studied in the wild but they can be studied more closely more rigorously and over a more sustained period of time in captivity . both sorts of study are valuable and as in point # there is no reason why this should not be done in the context of a cruelty-free zoo as well as in other contexts . <eos>

<s> animals in zoos can be studied more closely and without cruelty . <eos>
