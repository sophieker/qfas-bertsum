<s> female interests : does polygamy benefit the women that engage in it ? <eos>

<s> `` polygamy means to protect to take care of and maintain the wife . he told another society worker that polygamy was not illicit . but suharto prabhupad explained only if the man is able to maintain his wives . otherwise if he can not maintain another wife then to want another wife is not actually for protection . then all he wants is to have sex only . that is reckless and thus illicit sex . but if a man can not maintain another wife but has sex with her and gets her pregnant this is not good . who will maintain the woman and child ? then it is reckless sex and that is illicit . but if the man can properly maintain additional wife then it is not illicit <eos>

@highlight

<s> polygamy is only appropriate when a woman can providing for more than another wife <eos>
