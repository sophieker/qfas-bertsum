<s> blaming for conflict : who is to blaming as the secondary causes of the conflict ? <eos>

<s> `` was hamas provoked ? '' . global jewish news . january # # - `` israeli control of gaza s border was a response to hamas exploitation of israel s withdrawal from gaza to turning it into an armed islamic state dedicated to the destruction of israel above all else even its own economy . hamas was not provoked . quite the contrary . hamas arms smuggling was the provocation . then on bottom of this provocation hamas fired rockets indiscriminately into israel . the idea that hamas was provoke leapfrogs the facts . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> blockade was justly designed to cuts off arms imports to gaza <eos>
