<s> vs `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia good than withdrawing life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> the `` natural death '' alternative to euthanasia is not keep someone alive directly life supporting until they die on life support . that would indeed be unnatural . the naturally alternative is instead to allow them to die off of life support . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the alternatives to euthanasia is a natural death without life support . <eos>
