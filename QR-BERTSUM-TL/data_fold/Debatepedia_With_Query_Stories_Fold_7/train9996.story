<s> child 's quality of life : would genetic screening allow died humans to achieving more fulfilling and happier lives ? <eos>

<s> the technology is available to determine whether a baby is brought into the world with or no a genetic neurological disease such as huntingdon s. this technology should thus be used to prevent a child from living a life of suffering with huntingdon 's disease . [ # ] again this is not a case of engineering a child or altering a genome but choosing which of several embryos will be implanted into the mothers womb . it is only practical to choose a child with the best chance of being healthy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> genetic screening better creates the opportunity for a born children to live a healthy and fulfilling life . <eos>
