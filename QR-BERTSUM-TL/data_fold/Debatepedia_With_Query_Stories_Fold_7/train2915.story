<s> rights : do women not have a way to wear the burqa/niqab ? <eos>

<s> the burqa generates anxiety among those that fear muslim terrorism . it also generates frustration and concern for those that see it as representing the oppression of women . non of this is justified nothing for a ban but it is a cost . <eos>

@highlight

<s> burqa is culturally divisive and damaging . <eos>
