<s> fetus rights : is it wrong to assigning liberties to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> on `` the fetus cant know argument '' : animals abused suicide and but cutting down a tree are frequently illegally on the terms that these things have some value and should not be destroyed killed or treated inhumanely . it has little to do with the degree of consciousness attained by a creature . if the destruction of any habitat with a substantial value is illegally what makes abortion any different ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is wrong to killing foetuses on the basis that they ca n't think/feel . <eos>
