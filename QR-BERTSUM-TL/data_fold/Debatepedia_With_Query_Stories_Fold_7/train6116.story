<s> economics : will the portugal treaty be financially beneficial ? <eos>

<s> ireland is a good example of a state that protested the portugal treaty on the terms that it would constrain its abilities to use its low tax to attract foreign firms to do business in ireland . this is a concern in all states that use their lower tax and other incentives to attract foreign companies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lisbon treaty prevents states from attracting firms with low taxes . <eos>
