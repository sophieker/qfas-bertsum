<s> school : is it appropriate to ban heads scarves in private schools ? <eos>

<s> `` banning the hijab '' . workers power . feb # - `` however even while arguing against it the left should support the right of women to veils themselves . but this right should not be extended to schoolgirls . [ it is ] a fundamental denial of the rights of a children ( some argue that it is in fact a form of children abuse ) . the realities is that there will be cajoling and coercion by parents for girls as young as five to wear the hijab at an age where they will have little clue about their parents ' religion ( and that is why girls from non-muslim families who are free from this do not wear it ) . therefore an important democracy right - equality with non-muslim girls - <eos>
