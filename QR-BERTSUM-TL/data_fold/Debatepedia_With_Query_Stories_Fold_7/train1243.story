<s> hypocrisy : are nuclearised countries right to complain about north korean ? <eos>

<s> why is the us is authorized to have nucs ? why any other countries ? why not north korea ? if we do n't want north korea to have nucs then nobody should have them . yet until then criticisms from nuclearized countries are simply hypocritical . <eos>

@highlight

<s> other countries have nucs criticizing north korea is hypocritical . <eos>
