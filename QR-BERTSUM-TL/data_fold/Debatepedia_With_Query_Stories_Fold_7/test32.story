<s> is prostitutes a criminalized crime ? <eos>

<s> there are many dangers relating to all kinds of legal professions . a person work in a factory risks dismemberment chemicals burns and in some cases even death . a consumer of any product similarly risks injury due to defective parts or shoddy construction . in everything we do we are choosing a level of risk that is acceptable . the risk of a client catching an std is known and the client is willing to taking that risk . to using that as a terms for victimization would be silly when you would catch e-coli from a bag of spinach . <eos>

@highlight

<s> prostitutes/clients no more harmed than other workers/consumers . <eos>
