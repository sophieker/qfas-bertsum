<s> efficacy : can dioxide capture and storing be effective ? <eos>

<s> a few engineering proposals have been making for the more difficult task of capturing co # directly from the air but work in this area is still in its infancy . global research technologies demonstrated a pre-prototype in # . [ # ] capture costs are estimated to be lower than from points sources but may be feasible for dealt with emission from diffuse sources like automobiles and aircraft . the theoretically required electricity for air capture is only slightly more than for capture from points sources . the additional costs come from the devices that use the natural air flow . removing co # from the atmosphere is a forms of geoengineering by greenhouse gas remediation .

<s> ccs can be used to drawing dioxide directly from air . <eos>
