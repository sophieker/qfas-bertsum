<s> regional cohesion : does multiculturalism better encourage social cohesion and unity ? <eos>

<s> the metaphors used in this debate are important . the assimilation model is often referred to with the `` melting pot '' metaphor . the multiculturalism model is sometimes referred to with the `` mosaic '' metaphor . one should ask do we really need to be `` melting '' each other 's unique cultural heritage into a consistent cultural stew ? is the american mass-culture homogeneity desirable ? it seems that a `` mosaic '' of varied cultural representation is more interesting classy and but beautiful . <eos>

@highlight

<s> multiculturalism calling for a `` mosaic '' perhaps than a `` melting pot '' <eos>
