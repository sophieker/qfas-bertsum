<s> fulfilment of biblical prophecies <eos>

<s> opposite was an argument detailing a prophecy made by jesus which was seemingly false because that generation died before all of the signs of the end of the age had occurred however the footnotes of the niv translation of the bible mention that the word translated as `` generation '' could also be translated `` race '' . problem solved . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no biblical prophecies have so far failed to come true . <eos>
