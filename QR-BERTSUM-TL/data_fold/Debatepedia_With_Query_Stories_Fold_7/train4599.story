<s> militia : is a handgun unimportant to a militia ? is the militia irrelevant today ? <eos>

<s> the difference in the technology the military now employs versus the personal guns individual civilians can have access to is exponentially greater than in the framer 's time . this means that in today 's reality the second amendment can not apply to civilians with the purpose of preparing them to be part of the militia at any day or time.the huge technological advances and military training make it impossible for everyday citizens to be part of a defense force like the `` militia '' . <eos>
