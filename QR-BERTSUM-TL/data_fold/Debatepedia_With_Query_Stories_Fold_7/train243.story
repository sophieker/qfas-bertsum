<s> fulfilment of scriptural prophecy <eos>

<s> christ 's life was described in great detail by the prophets and many of the fulfilments of those prophecies could not possibly have been arranged by a con man . how could jesus have chosen his town of birth betrayal prices his method of execution ( crucifixion was a execution method that no one in their right thinking would chose and dead on a tree as prophesied was in jewish tradition viewed as actually the most ignominious ways to die ) his betrayer that he would be mocked spat on wounded ( but without break any bones ) and would have his clothes gambled for in the lead up to his death ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> the messianic prophecies can also be used to demonstrate that scriptural prophecies are not self-fulfilling . <eos>
