<s> `` keep '' : does `` keep '' in the 2nd amendment refer to an individual right to `` keep '' ? <eos>

<s> some interpretations of `` keep '' have hinted that it is simply to clean maintain and `` upkeep '' arms . this could be done in a barracks in which case the right to `` keep '' arms would have nothing to do with a right to individual possess . in parker v. district of columbia ( to be reviewed by the united states supreme court under the name district of columbia v. heller ) this argument was made . <eos>

@highlight

<s> to `` keep '' arms could only mean to `` upkeep '' them in a collective sense . <eos>
