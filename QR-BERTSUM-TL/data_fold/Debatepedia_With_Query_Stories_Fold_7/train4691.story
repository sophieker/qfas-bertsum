<s> differentiated responsibilities : do states have a `` common but differentiated responsibility '' ? <eos>

<s> in modern international capitalism and free trade states specialize in areas in which they have a comparative advantage . this may mean that some states specialize in manufacturing and some in services industries with far different emissions . attempting to hold these specializing states to the same per capita emissions levels therefore does not make sense . it would require that all states have the same share of all industries which is neither economically or environmentally desirable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> equality of per capita emissions does not work when states specialize . <eos>
