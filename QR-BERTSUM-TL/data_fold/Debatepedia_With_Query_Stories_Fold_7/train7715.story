<s> legitimacy : would the election of a president make the eu a more accountable institution ? <eos>

<s> the electing of a president in no way makes the eu a more accountable institution as it invariably increases the power a single person can hold such an outcome only reflects aspects of monarchy where in accountability is at is bare minimum . also since an elected president will undoubtedly be from a large member state his accountability can also be restricted to just his state the need for getting votes from his state in the next general elections being an precondition for such an act . thus resulting in the eu being not only a less accountable institution but also an institution of unjust accountability . <eos>
