<s> militia : is a handgun unimportant to a militia ? is the militias meaningless today ? <eos>

<s> the notion involved in the `` militia '' clause of the # nd amendments is that it is important for citizens to have the way to form a militia in order to combat a tyrannical government and presumably its army . in the modern day this would require that a militia be capable of muster powerful firearms including tanks and bazookas such that they could combat the modern power of the us military . based on this interpretation what use would handgun be to a militia whose inherent purpose is to combat or check the most powerful military the world has ever seen ? the handgun would provide negligible use to such a militia and so has little value in upholding any way the # nd amendments <eos>

@highlight

<s> handguns would be of little use to a militia fighting the us military . <eos>
