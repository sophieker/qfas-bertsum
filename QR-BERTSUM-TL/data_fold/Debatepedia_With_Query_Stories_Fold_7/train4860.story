<s> justice stevens with whom justice ginsburg justice breyer and justice sotomayor dissented from the majority ruling on citizens america arguing : `` at bottom the court 's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the american people who have recognised a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding and who have fought against the distinctively corrupting potentially of corporate electioneering since the days of theodore roosevelt . it is a strange time to repudiate that common sense . while american democracy is fallible few outside the majority of this court would have thought its flaw included a dearth of corporate money in politics .
