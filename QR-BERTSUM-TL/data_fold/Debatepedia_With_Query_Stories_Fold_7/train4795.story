<s> naturally gas : is pickens ' plan for naturally fuel vehicles a good idea ? <eos>

<s> `` what pickens has right what he has wrong '' . climateprogress . # june # - `` that brings us to the second part of pickens plan and to joe s correct judgment that using natural gas to run vehicle rather than power plants is a worse idea ... because we want to reduce carbon emission because we don t have limitless supplies of domestic oil and gas and because we would be stupid to allow even more dependence on foreign resources domestic natural gas should be treated careful as transition fuel to a sustainable low-carbon economy . given the growing urgency for climate action it makes sense to use natural gas the cleanest of the fossil fuels to replace coal the dirtiest .
