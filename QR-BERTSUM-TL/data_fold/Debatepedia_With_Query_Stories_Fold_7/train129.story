<s> needing the money : do school with higher achieving students need more money ? <eos>

<s> if high academically achieve school are at a high standards they really do n't want money to improve their standards of teaching there would be nothing to improve on . low achieve school who want and want funding to improve teaching and resources are at a higher priority . those school do have something to improve on and money should be focused on them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> higher achieving school want the money more . <eos>
