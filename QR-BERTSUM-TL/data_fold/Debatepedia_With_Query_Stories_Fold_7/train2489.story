<s> science : are there great scientific reasons for colonizing the moon ? <eos>

<s> a moon base would provide an excellent site for any kind of observatory . particular advantages arises from building observatory facilities on the moon from moon materials . as the moon 's rotation is so slow visible light observatories could performing observations for days at a time . it is possible to maintain near-constant observations on a specific target with a string of such observatories spanning the circumference of the moon . the fact that the moon is geologically inactive along with the lack of widespread human activities results in a remarkable lack of mechanical disturbance making it far easier to set up interferometer telescopes on the moon surface but at fairly high frequencies such as visible light . <eos>
