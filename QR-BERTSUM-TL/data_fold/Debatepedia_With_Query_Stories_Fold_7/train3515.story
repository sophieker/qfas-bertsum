<s> legality : is the blockade legal under global law ? <eos>

<s> marcelo kohen a law lecturer at switzerland s graduate institute of international studies argued that `` there is also at present a cease-fire on gaza . under [ israel 's ] logic one could maintain a naval blockades unendingly . it only requires one party to consider itself as being in a state of war . ' '' therefore israel can not justify its blockades and flotilla-raid in international waters on the grounds that it is `` at war '' or `` in conflict '' with hamas . <eos>
