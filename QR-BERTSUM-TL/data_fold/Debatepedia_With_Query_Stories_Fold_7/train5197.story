<s> commercial use of info : is the commercial use of personal information unethical ? <eos>

<s> why should we complain that advertisers will have more information about us to advertise to us things that we are more interested in buying ? advertising is not evil . ads inform the consumer of a product that they may judge to be of value in their lives and worth spending money on . no product is being forced on consumers by ads but offered as something that the consumer might deem worthy to purchase . therefore it should be welcome that social networking sites offer advertising firms information that can bring products of greater potential value to a particular consumer 's attention . <eos>

@highlight

<s> more targeted advertising is of greater value to the consumer . <eos>
