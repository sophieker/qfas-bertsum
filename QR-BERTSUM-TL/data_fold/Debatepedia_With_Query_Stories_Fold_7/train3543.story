<s> argentinian independence : did argentina inherit the malvinas upon gaining independence ? <eos>

<s> a territorial inheritance or succession requires a territorial cession . argentina achieved its independence by violent means against the opposition of spain who did not begin the recognise the independence of any of her american colonies till 1836. when she recognised argentina in 1859 no cession of sovereignty over the falklands took place . argentina can no more inherit what spain never ceded to her than a man can inherit from his father what his father never left him in his will . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unilateral secession does not confer rights of territorial inheritance . <eos>
