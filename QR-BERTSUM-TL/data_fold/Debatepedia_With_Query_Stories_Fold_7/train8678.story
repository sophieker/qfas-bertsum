<s> geopolitics : is the veto power unreflective of today 's geopolitical realities ? <eos>

<s> if all states are given equal power in the un sc it is possible that the most powerful states in the international system will simply not participate . this is not within the interests of the international community as the participation of the most powerful states is essential to achieving international objectives particularly security objectives . offering veto powers to the most powerful states helps incentivizes the participation of these powerful states and this ensures the longevity of the un and its objectives . <eos>

@highlight

<s> p- # veto encourages strongest states to work inside not outside the system <eos>
