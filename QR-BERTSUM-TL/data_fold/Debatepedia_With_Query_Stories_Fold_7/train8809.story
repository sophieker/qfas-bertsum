<s> political progress : are the politics in iraq hopeless warranting a withdrawal ? <eos>

<s> international support for the iraqi government is largely predicated on us involvement in the country as well as the legitimacy that the us presence lends . it is also based on the fact that the us presence better ensures the future of iraq and the iraqi government . without a us troop presence therefore other countries will find it harder to invest in the future of iraq and relations with its government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an early us withdrawal would undermine international support for the iraqi government <eos>
