<s> should a government have the right to draft its citizens into military service ? <eos>

<s> `` military virtues such as obedience to orders and respect for the chain of command can possibly be abused by aspiring dictators . armed forces can attract consciously or unconsciously people who prefer authoritarian systems . the army can even become the only chance for a job and decent life in times of unemployment ( this was crucial in the rise of japanese militarism ) or for despised minorities . such people may come to regard the army as their home and elevate it above the state . '' ( by wikipedia the free encyclopedia ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> a professional army can become a dangerous state-within-a-state . <eos>
