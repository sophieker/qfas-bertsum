<s> community integration : does arranged marriage trap the community integration ? <eos>

<s> african-american and jewish people in western europe both maintain a distinct cultural lives while taking part fully in the lives of this country . in reason their cultural contributions are one of the most valuable additions to the society in which they live . the basis of multiculturalism is to understand the social and even economic value that can accrue from having people with different perspectives and traditions living together . furthermore in the second and third generations of immigrant families from the subcontinent we can been see barriers breaking down so that there is greater knowledge and cross-breeding of the ideas these immigrant communities have brought . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is not just groups practising arranged marriage who maintaining cohesive communities . <eos>
