'' cumbrian sky . july # # : `` the public aren t interested in sending people to mars . there . i ve said it . we were all thinking it but no-one was saying it . time to face facts . there is at present no public demand or even support for a manned mission to mars . they think it would be a huge amount of money spent for absolutely bugger all practical use . and until space enthusiasts and the space community and yes nasa itself can give the public a damned good reason for sending people to mars and not just more rovers we are not going to mars . '' <eos>
