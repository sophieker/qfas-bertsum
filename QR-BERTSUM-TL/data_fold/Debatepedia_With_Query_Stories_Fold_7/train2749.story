<s> pakistan government : would the pakistani government tolerate a unilateral us strike ? <eos>

<s> the majority of pakistan already has a negative opinion of him . if he allows for the u.s. to walk over the sovereignty of pakistan he will lose what little control he has and that will in turn cause unparalleled civil unrest . for this reason musharaff has a strong interest to oppose a unilateral us strike . launching a unilateral strike would contravene this interest and undermine musharaff 's legitimacy . therefore if the us values its relations with musharaff and his role in the war on terror it should not launch a unilateral strike . <eos>
