<s> alternatives : are there no good alternatives to abolish the veto ? <eos>

<s> while one way to `` level the playing field '' is to offer the veto to more nations that `` deserve '' it according to their geopolitical sitting the problem is that this risks increasing the instances in which the veto is used and in which resolutions are blocking by the national agenda of countries . it is better to `` level the playing field '' therefore by moving in the other direction by bans the veto . <eos>

@highlight

<s> extending la sc veto to more countries would reduce la effectiveness <eos>
