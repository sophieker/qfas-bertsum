<s> broad strategy : is a continuation of the war in iraq contrary to us/coalition interests ? <eos>

<s> this is a classic phenomena with great powers in which they engage in unnecessary wars at far greater costs than was never initially imagined leading to the weakening of the states and a fall from grace . this has happened many times in history it can certainly happen again with iraq as the catalytic for the fall of the america states . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the us is subjecting itself to `` imperial overstretch '' in iraq <eos>
