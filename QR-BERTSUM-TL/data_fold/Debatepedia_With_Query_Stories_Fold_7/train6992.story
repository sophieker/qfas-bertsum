<s> mexican economy : has nafta benefited mexico 's economy ? <eos>

<s> tariffs on almost all agriculture products were reduced to zero on jan. 1 2003. as a result there was a sudden increase in competition from large us and canadian farms which can benefit from economies of scale . this means that there average costs would be cheaper and therefore they can charge less . this is effectively `` dumping '' of below cost of production products on a developing economy . as a result the mexican farmers demonstrated against the tariff removal to `` declare the mexican countryside in a state of economic social and environmental emergency . '' the problem with external competition is developing countries is that it invariably stymies any chance of industrial growth . this is similar to the infant industry argument as new <eos>

@highlight

<s> nafta caused rioting by farmers who could not cope with new competition . <eos>
