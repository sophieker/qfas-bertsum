<s> tax revenues : is it inconsequential that a ban would endanger tax revenues ? <eos>

<s> it is which true that tax revenues would be lost if alcohol were banned . however again this is not a principled reason to reject the proposition merely a practical problem . it should be pointed out that government would save a huge amount of money on police and health spending ( through the reduction in crime and alcohol-related illness ) which would go at least some of the way to offsetting the decreased tax revenues . <eos>

@highlight

<s> alcoholic should be banned/restricted on principal ; tax revenue is a practicality . <eos>
