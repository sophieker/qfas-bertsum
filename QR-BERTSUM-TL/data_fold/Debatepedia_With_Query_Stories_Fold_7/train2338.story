<s> disagreement model : is the disagreement model of dialogue defective or ideal ? <eos>

<s> justice and truth exist in the world . they are peculiar concepts that we must strive for . if everyone were just and fully aware of all the facts they would all be of the same opinions regarding the truth and the way direction to take society . thus we should not settle with members of societies having different opinions and should strive to foster dialogue toward the gaol of achieving a greater consensus around what is true and just . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` truth '' `` righteousness '' and `` the right path '' are legitimately notions making disagreement possible . <eos>
