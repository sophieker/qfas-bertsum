<s> cut off internet : is this an appropriate `` proportional '' punishment ? <eos>

<s> graduated response would cuts off web access for those ignore the first two warning only temporarily from between # months to a year and possibly less for people that promise to never again pirate musive and other files illegally . this means that cut off web access can be measured proportionately to the severity of the infringement that took place . <eos>

@highlight

<s> graduating response would only permanently cutoff internet . <eos>
