<s> justice : does affirmative action justly compensate past wrongs ? <eos>

<s> given that most people in the current generations have never been harmed individually or unequally by government ( in the sense of institutionalized racism it is impossible to compensate them for harms that never occurred to them personally . affirmative action wrongly attempts to perform such compensation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no group should benefit or be punished for ancestral wrongs . <eos>
