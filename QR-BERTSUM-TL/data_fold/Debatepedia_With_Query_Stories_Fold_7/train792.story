<s> feasibility : is bans prostitution feasible ? <eos>

<s> - granted that prostitution has been particular in societies across the world for thousands of year governments should recognise that it can not be eradicated . consequently they should pass legislative that makes prostitution safer rather than persist with futile and dangerous prohibition . existing legal prohibition of soliciting or of prostitution itself does not work . prostitutes are regularly convicted of description offences and fined . it is then necessary for them to return to work as prostitutes in order to repay the fines . british police officers have described this methods of legal prohibition of prostitution as a revolving door . the law banning prostitution are in reason counter-productive . <eos>
