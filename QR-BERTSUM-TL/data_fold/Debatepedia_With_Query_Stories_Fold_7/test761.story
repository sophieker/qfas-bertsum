<s> family integrity : does humans cloning harm the integrity of the family ? <eos>

<s> furthermore we should not pretending that each child conceived by sexual procreation is born to wholly well-intentioned parents . the desire to have a son and heir is common around the world but does not concern the welfare of the future child . similarly children are often conceived out of marital customize in order to consolidate a relationships or even in order to gain free accommodation from local housing authorities . finally many children are not intended at all but are born as a result of unplanned pregnancies . there could be no fear of accidental cloning that could bring a child to a parent who was overwhelmed or unwilling to love it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> parental motives ca n't be used against cloning and not normal child-rearing <eos>
