<s> needing the money : do schools with higher achieving students need more money ? <eos>

<s> if high academically achieving schools are at a high standard they really do n't need cash to improving their standard of teach there would be nothing to improving on . low achieving schools who need and need funding to improving teach and resources are at a higher priority . those schools do have something to improving on and cash should be focusing on them . <eos>

<s> lower achieving school need the money more . <eos>
