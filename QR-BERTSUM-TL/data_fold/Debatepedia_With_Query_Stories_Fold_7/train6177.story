<s> constitution/due process : is there inadequate due process in plea bargaining in exchange for testimony ? <eos>

<s> the notion of a `` right to a speedy trial '' uses the specific word `` trial '' not plea bargain . it is necessary to speed up the process of trial but plea bargains are a short-cut that emphasizes speed without the due process of a trial . some say that plea bargaining in exchange for testimony helps to generally relieve the court system and speed up the process . but the process should be sped up within the legitimate means of trial . this means that the court system should be improved supplied with more resources and generally made more efficient . <eos>

@highlight

<s> justice and due process are at risk if plea bargains are implemented to speed the process : <eos>
