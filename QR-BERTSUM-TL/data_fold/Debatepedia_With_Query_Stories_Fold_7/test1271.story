<s> school : is it specific to ban head scarves in public schools ? <eos>

<s> christina duval . `` banning the hijab . against the ban for secular education '' . employees power . feb # -- `` will banning the headscarf enable those young women who do n't want to wear it break download from their oppression ? no since outside of school they will but be obliged to don the headscarf . even worse some may be taken out of school -- as has already happened in france -- where they will be even more isolated from progressive ideas . unsurprisingly calls for separate schools have increased within the muslims communities since the publication of the stasi report . '' <eos>
