<s> level playing field : are subsidies unfair to clean energy ? <eos>

<s> supporters of oil subsidies contend that oil subsidies are necessary because clean energy is not yet viable and the economy remains dependent on oil . yet it is precisely these subsidies that make it impossible for renewable energy to compete and perpetuate the dependence on oil . subsidies are therefore a self-fulfilling-prophecy in this regard . <eos>

@highlight

<s> ending oil subsidies levels playing field for clean energy <eos>
