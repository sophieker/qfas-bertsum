<s> economics : are mandatory calorie counts economically friendly ? <eos>

<s> how can restaurants be spontaneously with item on their menus if they always must list the calories in each item ? they ca n't . rather they will have to `` stick to the menu '' more and more and the creativity and spontaneity of chefs will dwindle making restaurants less appealing to customers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> calorie counts eliminate ability of restaurant to be spontaneous . <eos>
