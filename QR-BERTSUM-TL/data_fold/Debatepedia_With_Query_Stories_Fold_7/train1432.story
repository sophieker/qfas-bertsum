<s> `` keep '' : does `` keep '' in the # nd amendment refer to an individual way to `` keep '' ? <eos>

<s> if we are to read `` keep '' as meaning `` upkeep '' or maintaining in the # nd amendment we are to some regard accusing the framers of being extremely misleading . the common meaning of `` keep '' at the time was not `` clean '' and `` maintain '' but posses and store . why would the framers choose to be so misleading ? it seems extremely unlikely that they would . <eos>

<s> why could the framers be so misleading as to oversimplify `` keep '' with `` upkeep '' ? <eos>
