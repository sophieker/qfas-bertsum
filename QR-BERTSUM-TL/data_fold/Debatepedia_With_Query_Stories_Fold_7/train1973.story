<s> legality : is the blockades law under global law ? <eos>

<s> james guilfoyle a specialist in international and maritime law at university college london : `` the real question is : 'is the blockade itself lawful ? ' everything else turns on that [ ... ] [ the blockade is illegal ] if it will cause excessive damage to the civilian population in relation to the military advantage gained ... so therefore intercepting a vessel on the high seas to support or enforce the blockade would not be lawful . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> gaza blockade harms too many civilians for large military gains . <eos>
