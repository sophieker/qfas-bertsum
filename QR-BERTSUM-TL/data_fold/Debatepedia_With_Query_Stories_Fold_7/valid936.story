<s> fulfilment of biblical prophecies <eos>

<s> the year of the re-emergence of israel as a nation was predicted in the bible as well as many other things such as the european union the euro and possibly also the atomic bomb and satellite television . christ 's life was described in great detail by the prophets centuries before the events happened and many of these events can be verified by sources outside of the bible . it is obviously highly unlikely that such prophecies were not divinely inspired . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the fulfillment of numerous biblical prophecies proves that the bible is inspired by god . <eos>
