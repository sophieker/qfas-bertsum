<s> does trading with human rights abusers encourage human rights abuses ? <eos>

<s> many human rights violators involve themselves in abuse for the very reason that they are trying to gain financially from it ( or perhaps even just survive as businesses ) . trading with human rights abusers may actually have the effect of making it easier financially for their businesses to offer more acceptable working conditions working hours and pay . but this process all requires that trade with these abusers takes place so that they can more quickly move their businesses forward . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trade may reduce monetary incentive for forms of abuse . <eos>
