<s> property : is the libertarian perspective on property appropriate ? <eos>

<s> a principal 20th century liberal theorists john rawls originated the idea of a the `` veil of ignorance '' . the idea is that imagining we all had no idea how we would `` come out of the womb '' and whether we would be `` advantaged or disadvantaged '' what kind of social contract would we construct . we would want to construct one in which we minimized the risks to ourselves if we happened to get the `` short-end of the stick '' . this is why a degree of `` equality of outcome '' is important . libertarianism does not recognize these ideas . <eos>

@highlight

<s> liberal democracies should ensure a degree of `` equality of outcome '' <eos>
