<s> workers : does free trade benefit workers ? who benefits and loses ? <eos>

<s> when a worker is laid off from a job they are typically put in a poor bargaining position to find a similar-paying job both because they were laid-off and because they are likely to lack the necessary skills . <eos>

@highlight

<s> workers who lose their jobs to free trade earn less in the new jobs they find <eos>
