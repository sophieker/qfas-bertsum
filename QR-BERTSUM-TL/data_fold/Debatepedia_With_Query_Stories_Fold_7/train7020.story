<s> electric grid : is solar energy compatible with electric grids ? <eos>

<s> electric grids must physically match electricity supply and demand . this means that electricity sources are best for the grid when they are consistent . solar energy however is inconsistent making it less compatible with the fundamental principles of electric grids . <eos>

@highlight

<s> inconsistent solar energy is a challenge for electric grids . <eos>
