<s> covenant vs. no-fault : are covenant marriages a good option than no-fault laws ? <eos>

<s> the us supreme courts ruled more than # years ago that the state of residence at the time of the divorce determine the laws governing the divorce . so if the covenant marriage partners move to a state without covenant marriage laws they are download to using the alimony system anyway . this makes for a possibly weak covenant marriage system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> salvation marriage laws are weak . <eos>
