<s> civil war ? could an early withdrawal avoid causing a civil war ? <eos>

<s> the obvious reason why coalition troops are effective in holding iraqi factions apart is that they are not iraqi shiites iraqi sunnis nor iraqi kurds . this means that coalition troops can act effectively ad unbiased arbiters security forces policemen and check point officers . and iraqis can trust coalition troops as unbiased in these roles which is absolutely essential . if coalition forces were not trusted as arbiters in a sectarian conflicts they would would not be approaches by iraqis with important information on crime or sectarian violence . <eos>

@highlight

<s> coalition forces are neutral and so more capable than iraqi troops of preventing civil war <eos>
