<s> human dignity : is human cloning contrary to the notion of human dignity ? <eos>

<s> it is difficult to understand why the act of sexual intercourse that leads to sexual procreation is any more dignified or respectable than a reasoned decision by an adult to have a child that is assisted by modern science . the thousands of children given life through ivf therapy do not suffer a lack of dignity as a consequence of their method of procreation . the catholic church regards every embryo from the moment of existence as a living person . this position is not shared by most western governments and it would deny not only cloning but ivf and all the medical knowledge and benefits that have accrued from embryo research . <eos>
