<s> economics : is mandatory vaccination economical ? <eos>

<s> productivity rates remain high and less money is earmarked for society and health transfers because people are healthier . the developing world would benefits enormously from effective and compulsory vaccine against killer diseases such as aid and malaria but irrational opposition to vaccination in developed countries makes it less possibly that government resources and the attention of pharmaceutical companies will be targeted towards these goals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vaccination help prevent negative economic effect of disease . <eos>
