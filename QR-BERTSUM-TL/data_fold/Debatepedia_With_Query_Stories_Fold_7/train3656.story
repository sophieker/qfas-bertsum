<s> double standard : are there `` double standards '' in this debate ? <eos>

<s> if images had been published in the middle east of jesus with a bomb on his head it would be seen as xenophobic . and yet images of muhammad with a bomb on his head that are published in denmark are seen as expressions of free speech . mohammed al-shaibani wrote in kuwait 's al-qabas daily on january 30 2006 - `` in [ the west ] it is considered freedom of speech if they insult islam and muslims . but such freedom becomes racism and a breach of human rights and anti-semitism if arabs and muslims criticize their religion and religious laws . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> a tolerant double standard is being applied to the jyllands-posten muhammad cartoons . <eos>
