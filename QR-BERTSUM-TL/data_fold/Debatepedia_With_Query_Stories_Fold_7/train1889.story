<s> we business : is the sanctioning of cuba bad for we businesses ? <eos>

<s> there is a major market in the cuba for united states export goods . sanctions although deprive us businesses of the opportunity of profiting from these possibilities . in this way the united states is harming itself in order to sanctions cuba and this makes little sense . mid-western republicans have all voted to drop the embargo because of the potential for profit in their agriculture states . this is a market for american products as well as a local producer . further if sanctions end americans will be able to stop pretending that they prefer bolivian cigars !
