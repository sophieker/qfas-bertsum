<s> feasibility : is it feasible to equalizing paying between men and women ? <eos>

<s> it is not really fair that tournaments in which both sexes ( separately ) compete such as rafael are grounded out for campaigns for equality as different levels of popularity and physical ability has resulted in this differentiation around all major sports such as soccer rugby cricket basketball baseball . there is a danger that sports administrators will decide the best way to avoid forcing equality is to scrap joint tournaments in which men and women compete at the same time in parallel competitions . this would have the unintended consequence of reducing the opportunities for women to compete at the top level and so to earn the highest financial rewards .

@highlight

<s> equal-pay campaigns are selectively discrimination and risk causing a backlash against joint tournaments that will harms female pay : <eos>
