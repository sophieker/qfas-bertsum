<s> playing god/nature ? is human cloning playing gods and/or nature ? <eos>

<s> it is not merely intervention in the body s natural processes but the creation of a new and wholly unnatural process of asexual reproduction . clerics within the catholic moslem and jewish faiths have all expressed their opposition to human cloning.however this objections to cloning is not specifically theological . david hume the eighteenth-century scottish moral philosopher warned us to heed our feelings as too as our logical reasoning . leon r. kass of the university of chicago has stated in regard to human cloning that mere failures to produce scientific reasons against the technology does not mean we should deny our strong and instinctive reactions to it . as he state there is a `` wisdom in repugnance '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cloning played against god 's intention for reproduction and family . <eos>
