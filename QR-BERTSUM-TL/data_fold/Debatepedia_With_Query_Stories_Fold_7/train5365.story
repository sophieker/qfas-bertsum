<s> regional security : is an `` open '' policy to foreign students good for regional security ? <eos>

<s> - it is very unlikely or uncommon that any safety benefits will come from the screening of prospective foreign students . and but the cost of such restrictive measures are very high . depriving a foreign student of an education they desire cuts them from the benefits described above . <eos>

@highlight

<s> restrictions on student-visa program rarely produce national security benefits <eos>
