<s> economics : are hybrid vehicles economically sensible ? <eos>

<s> this is a very small number of miles compared to mundane gasoline vehicles which last around # # miles . this means that one individual would have to purchase three hybrids to obtain the same length of life of a regular gasoline vehicle . this is three-times the costs for the same value . and even if owners do n't need to keep a car for over # # miles the net effect to the economy is that hybrids live one-third as long and are nearly three times as expensive to individuals and the economy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hybrid batteries and car are constructed to last only # # miles <eos>
