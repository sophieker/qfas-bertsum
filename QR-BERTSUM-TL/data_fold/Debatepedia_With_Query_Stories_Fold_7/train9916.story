<s> industry : should the medical marijuana industry be encouraged ? <eos>

<s> if marijuana dispensaries are indeed about providing marijuana for medical purposes than entire dispensaries are probably excessive . instead why not carry medical marijuana in pharmacies ? this would probably reduce the excessive supply and abuses and would certainly eliminate concerns of shady crowds centering around dispensaries and creating concerns for local communities . <eos>
