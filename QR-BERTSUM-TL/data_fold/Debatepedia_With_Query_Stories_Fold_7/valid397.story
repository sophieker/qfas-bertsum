'' washington time cato . may # nd # : `` there were # firefighters killed at the world trade center on september # # . nobody then suggested the fact that these men were paid professionals detracts from their heroism . nobody worried whether the relative numbers of whites blacks or asian firefighters was fair and balanced . nationwide another # firefighters died in # -- a typical yearly loss . from # to # an average of # law law officer also were killed each year in the line of duty . if compulsory service is such a fair and reasonable idea why do n't mr. hagel mr. rangel and others of their ilk favors drafting people to be firemen and cops ?
