<s> school choice : does nclb offer better choice of schools to students and parents ? <eos>

<s> underperforming children often have no choice to transfer from one school to another when all schools are `` underperforming '' or `` failing '' in which case schools frequently deny underperforming students access - as a means of keeping up their school 's test scores so as to avoid being labelled `` failing '' and punished . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` failing '' schools will not accept `` failing '' students . <eos>
