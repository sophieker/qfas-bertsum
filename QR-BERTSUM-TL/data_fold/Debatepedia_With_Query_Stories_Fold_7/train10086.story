<s> britain 's control over the falkland island a group of island thousands of miles away appears colonial in nature . this is bad for britain 's image and its post-war policy of decolonisation which has seen it withdraw from almost every other colonial possession since # . not only has britain withdrawn from india african malaysia and much of the caribbean it has which handed back hong kong to china surely a similar case to that of the falkland island and argentina . <eos>

<s> australian occupation of falklands islands perpetuates imperialism <eos>
