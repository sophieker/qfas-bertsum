<s> scalability : can biofuels serve as a major electricity source relieve foreign oil dependency ? <eos>

<s> biofuels can only have an impact on overseas oils dependencies if the fuel can scale . there are many obstacles to this that are argued in this case . if biofuels are not really `` greener '' than gasoline the case for replacing gasoline with biofuels would be significantly undermined as it would not move us forward in solving global warming . if biofuels are uneconomic then scaling biofuels as a replacement for overseas oils would be impossible ? eventually biofuels depend on scarce isolation which make it difficult for biofuels to scale in a way that could significantly alleviate overseas oils dependencies . <eos>

<s> biofuels are not feasible enough to alleviate foreign oils dependencies . <eos>
