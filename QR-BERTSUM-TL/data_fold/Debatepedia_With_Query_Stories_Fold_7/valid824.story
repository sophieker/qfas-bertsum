<s> rights : which system better protects individuals rights and counter discrimination ? <eos>

<s> why could state recognition of indigenous groups and similarities between them imply empower these different groups ? might it actually alienate them ? might it weaken them by bring to the surface historical grievances and pain ? might it create tension and conflict that further weakens them ? while it is certainly possibility that multiculturalism can better enable a minority groups to communicating with its government it is unclear if it is worth it as compared with these other costs and if it is then ultimately empowering for these groups . <eos>

@highlight

<s> multiculturalism does not help empowering minority groups <eos>
