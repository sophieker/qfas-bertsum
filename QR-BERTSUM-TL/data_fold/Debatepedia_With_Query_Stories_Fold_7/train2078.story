<s> israeli society : would dividing jerusalem devastate israeli society ? <eos>

<s> ben gurion explain in 1937 `` for the jews the millions of the jews who do not know the difference between the sharon [ or the jezre'el ] and the valley [ or the difference between rehavia and the old city ] the name jerusalem means everything . '' [ 5 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> jerusalem is too important to jewish identity to be divided <eos>
