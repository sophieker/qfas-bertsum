<s> birds : do wind turbines have a negligible impacts on birds ? <eos>

<s> `` danger to birds is sometimes the main complaint against the installation of a winds turbine but exact numbers are very low : studies show that the numbers of birds killed by winds turbines is negligible compared to the numbers that die as a result of other human activities such as traffic hunt power lines and high-rise buildings and especially the environmental impacts of using non-clean power sources . for example in the uk where there are several hundred turbines about one bird is killed per turbine per year ; # million per years are killed by cars alone . [ # ] in the united states turbines kill # # birds per years compared to # million killed by cars and # . # million killed by collisions <eos>

@highlight

<s> the number of birds killing by wind turbines is fairly low <eos>
