<s> state authority ? does the state have the authority to limit the liberties of citizens ? <eos>

<s> paul tetlock jason burnett and robert hahn . `` ban cell phones in cars ? '' . cato.org . december 29 2000 - `` indeed it is likely that the market will more effectively address cell phone risks than will government intervention . if the cell phone problem becomes serious enough car insurance companies can classify drivers who use cell phones in higher-risk groups and charge them commensurately higher premiums . because an insurance company bears the burden of reimbursing injured parties for their losses a company may decide to charge drivers who use cell phones higher premiums to compensate for the increased risk that cell phones force the company to assume .
