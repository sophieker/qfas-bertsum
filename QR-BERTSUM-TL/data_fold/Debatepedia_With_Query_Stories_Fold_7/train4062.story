<s> values : does the bank stand for the wrong values ? <eos>

<s> the bank has evinced willingness to deal directly with almost any government without sensitivity to their human rights record . given that developing countries are both shareholders and clients in the bank the agencies are unlikely to admit that loans to a particular regime will not achieve any benefit until a reformed government achieves power . the negotiation process between the bank and the regime is invariably closed and the circulation of bank reports restricted to the participants . the poor are disenfranchised from the very institution supposed to support their development .

@highlight

<s> the world bank investment policy consolidates the position of the corrupt inefficient and antidemocratic regimes of many developing countries . <eos>
