<s> cultural standards : does assimilation set a false moral-cultural standard ? <eos>

<s> while multiculturalism does attempt to protect the cultures of immigrants by doing so it diminishes the culture of the host country . add a new culture into society and another culture loses out finding less space to express and exercise itself . and the cultures that lose out from the entry of new immigrant cultures may be historically-rooted and nationally-honored cultures . therefore multiculturalism has its cultural costs just as assimilation has its costs . but the distinction is that assimilation better protects a host country 's historical culture while multiculturalism better protects new-entrant cultures . if historically-rooted cultures are seen as more important to protect than the assimilation model may have greater cultural preservation value . <eos>
