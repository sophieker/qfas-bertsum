<s> fetus rights : is it wrong to assign rights to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> it is unquestionable that the fetus at whatever stage of development will inevitably develop the traits of a full-grown human person . it will also inevitably accumulate all of the rights that you yourself have . if we deprive the unborn of life via abortions however they will be deprived of all of this potential and future rights . this is why extending a right to life is of utmost importance ; the future of the unborn depends on it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a fetus is uniquely capable of becoming a person ; deserves rights <eos>
