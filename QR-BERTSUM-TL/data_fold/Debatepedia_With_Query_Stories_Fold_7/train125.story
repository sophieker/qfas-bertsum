<s> family friend : should `` a friend of the family '' act as a surrogate mother ? <eos>

<s> this arrangement would in fact create more problems than it solved as such an unofficial arrangement would be a legal nightmare if the surrogate decided ( as has often happened ) to keep the baby as she would of course be the child s legal mother . important link are formed between mother and baby in the second seven months and to forcibly sever these link would be devastating for all concerned . also it would be far more complicated and damaging for the child if their biological mother was somebody who from an early ages they had known as a friend of their parents . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is a worse thought for surrogate mothers to be `` friends of the family '' . <eos>
