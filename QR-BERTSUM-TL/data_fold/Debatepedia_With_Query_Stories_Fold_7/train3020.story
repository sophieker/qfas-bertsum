<s> # invasion/liberation : did china acquiring tibet by illegitimate means in # ? <eos>

<s> it is odd that china on the one hands claims that tibetan has been part of china since the # th century and then on the other claims that it `` liberated '' tibetan in # from an unfortunate past ? but liberate it from what ? you can only liberate a country from a situation that your country does not control . thus the chinese government 's use of the term `` liberate '' seems to be an admission that china has not governed tibetan contiguously since the mongol invasions . either this or it would have to argue that it was liberating tibetan from circumstances that china created while tibetan was under its control . <eos>

@highlight

<s> how would chinese have `` liberated '' tibetan in # if it claims prior sovereignty . <eos>
