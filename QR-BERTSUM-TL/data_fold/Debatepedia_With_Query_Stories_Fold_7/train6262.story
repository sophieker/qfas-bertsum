<s> evolution : is incest consistent with evolutionary principles ? <eos>

<s> incest is against the natural order of things . people are not supposed to mates with blood relatives but with people from a different family . this is meant to ensure the random mixing of genes that enables variation within human offspring and the potential for evolution . diverging from this natural order is wrong on those levels . it impairs the natural evolutionary process which weakens human evolutionary progress and improvement . symbolically it diminishes the respect we place on the natural sexual order that has enabled humans to become the sacred creatures that we are . similarly for people of faith it diminishes the values placed on the sexual order created by god . <eos>
