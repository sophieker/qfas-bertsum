<s> environment : would underground nuclear waste storage present a threat ? <eos>

<s> nearly all countries produce nuclear waste . no matter what therefore the world must find a way to deal with it . if underground storage is the best way then the world has no choice but to adopt the practice . a november # eu nuclear commission report : `` all eu member states generate radioactive waste whether or not they have a national nuclear power program and therefore have to identify solutions and define national requirements to manage it properly . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> states w/o nuclear programs still generate radioactive waste . <eos>
