<s> male preferences : do males prefer uncircumcised penises ? <eos>

<s> `` circumcision alters sexuality function '' . national organization of circumcision information . opposing views -- `` the movements and skin contact an intact woman needs to reach orgasm are compatibility with the movements and skin contact a lady needs to reach orgasm . the dryness abrasion and chafing complaints of some women along with their inability to have an orgasm are oftentimes complications of circumcision . a circumcised male has little lubrication of his own and he removes much of a woman 's vaginal lubrication with each outstroke . in addition a circumcised male needs longer strokes to stimulate the small sensitive area ( frenular remnant ) on the underside of his penis to reach ejaculation . each long outstroke distances him from the woman 's clitoris making it harder for her <eos>
