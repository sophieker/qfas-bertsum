<s> learning : does it lead to improving learning in its broadest sense ? <eos>

<s> while music art culture and physical education are important they are not testable . you can only create a standardized test around information that is common and fairly objective . no children left behind does this focusing on history math and reading comprehension . it can not be blamed for not testing arts and music . these subjects are not testable . schools should however taught them and not simply focus on teaching to the nclb test . <eos>

@highlight

<s> k-12 test what is testable ; art and music is not testable . <eos>
