<s> missions -- does the commonwealth lack a valuable and helpful missions in the world ? <eos>

<s> it confers no trade privileges upon its members does not coordinate their defence or foreign policy and lacks both the budget and the executive authority to make a practical difference in the world . periodic meetings of commonwealth heads of government are at best a talking-shop and at worst an expensive junket . it would be far better for its members to commit their attention and goodwill to more tangible global organisations such as the un nato regional liberalization areas etc <eos>

@highlight

<s> the united has no clearly role and mission : <eos>
