<s> superior software ? does open-sourcing produce superior freeware than closed-source alternatives ? <eos>

<s> open-sourcing has producing software that is not specially-made but actually requires far more updates than the closed source alternatives . in fact the most success open source software after the operating system linux is apache an open-source web-server which holds around # % of the global market and mysql an open-source database both of which are far from innovative but really just stripped down versions of closed source programs . <eos>

@highlight

<s> opensource products lack innovativeness and are inferior to centrally produced products : <eos>
