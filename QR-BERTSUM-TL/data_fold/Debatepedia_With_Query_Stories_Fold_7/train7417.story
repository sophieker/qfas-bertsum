<s> politicians/others : could this ban apply to everyone that might decide to put up a political ad or just politicians ? <eos>

<s> it s true that there are implementation issues on this policy . but at least it would have some effect and go some way in making the political environment more palatable . the internet would indeed be a big problems but it s nevertheless still the case that most people get their impression of political candidates from tv and printed which we can police . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the ban should apply to everyone : <eos>
