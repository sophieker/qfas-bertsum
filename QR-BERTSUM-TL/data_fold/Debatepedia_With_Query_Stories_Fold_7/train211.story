'' the new england journal of medicine . july # # : `` the voluntary insurance system has also distracted insurers from developing incentives and mechanism for efficiently managing health care costs . because total health care expenditures are so concentrated the most expensive # % of the population accounts for half of aggregate health care spending whereas the bottom # % of spenders account for only # % # the gains to insurers of avoiding the sick outweigh any possible gains from managing their care . as a consequent resources have been devoted to such avoidance at a direct cost to effective care management . national health care costs <eos>
