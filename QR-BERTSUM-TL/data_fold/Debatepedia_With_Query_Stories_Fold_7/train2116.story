<s> utility in war : do land mines provide little military utility ? <eos>

<s> in # military experts from # countries signed on to an icrc policy statement based on an independent study that concluded that mines were of limited military utility . [ # ] this is in part because landmines can be defused by an enemy with relative ease . and also they can be worked-around with tunnels and alternative routes . finally as seen below they also inhibit the movement of those that plant them which can be particularly dangerous if a military is flanked and forced to move across the mine field . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the usefulness of landmines is significantly over-represented : <eos>
