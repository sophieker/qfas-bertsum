<s> culture : is bullfights a culture artistic practice ? <eos>

<s> video pictures books and articles reports all make it possible for individuals to learn about and understand death . it 's occurring around us naturally all the time . it is completely unnecessary therefore to artificially producing death in the bullfighting arena in order to create an appreciation of the cycle of life and death etc . natural watching is also a good alternative . or even hunting or fishing in which an individual generally attempts to quickly and decently kills an animal that they will then eat . tormenting and bull for entertainment is unnecessary when compared to these outlets for understanding life and death . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people need not see bull die in order to know death . <eos>
