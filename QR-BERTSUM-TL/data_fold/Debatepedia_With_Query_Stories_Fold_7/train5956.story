<s> waste : can reactors wastes be dealt with adequately ? <eos>

<s> nuclear waste is not being reprocessed except in a very few countries . there is no closed cycle for it to be framed as `` recycling '' . it is cheaper to mine new uranium than reprocessed spent uranium . second spent uranium has to be disposed of and dealt with at one point even if it is reprocessed and the radioactivity of it remains . <eos>

@highlight

<s> reprocessing nuclear waste is not a viable ecological solution . <eos>
