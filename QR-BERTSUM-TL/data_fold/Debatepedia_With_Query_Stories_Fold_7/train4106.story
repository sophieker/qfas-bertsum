<s> democracy : is the superdelegate system adequately representative and democratic ? <eos>

<s> it is truth that politics parties are currently given the power to choose the nominee that they desire through a process largely of their choosing in accordance with the right to association laws . but if it is believed that the general election must be fully democratic why then not the primaries ? the primaries are in reason where most partisan voters choose to their candidate . most democrats will vote in the general election for whichever democratic nominee arises and most republicans will vote in the general election for whichever republican nominee emerges . therefore the real `` choice '' for most citizens is making in the primaries . as such it is where citizens ' have the most power of choice through their vote and it <eos>

@highlight

<s> voters should be fully empowered to choose secondary nominee . <eos>
