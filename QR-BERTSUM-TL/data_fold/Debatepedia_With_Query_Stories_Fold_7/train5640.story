<s> humaneness : could the culling of kangaroos be done humanely ? <eos>

<s> emeritus professor gordon grigg - university of queensland . `` kangaroos on defence lands - another view '' . march # th # : `` darting followed by lethal injection sounds simple and humane and is probably a good option for small numbers of animals . for animals at high density because you have to be close to shoot the dart and because it takes time for a dart to take effect the proximity of the shooters and the odd behaviour of the darted individual all contribute to a stressful situation for the other kangaroos which will hop about frantically in great distress . '' <eos>

<s> kangaroo shooting may be preferable to culling by dart-euthanasia <eos>
