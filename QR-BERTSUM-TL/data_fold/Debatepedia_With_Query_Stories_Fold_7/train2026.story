<s> diplomacy : will returning the islands uk-argentina-south american relations ? <eos>

<s> britain already has a working relationship with argentina . in 2001 tony blair became the first british prime minister to visit argentina since the 1982 conflict . the agreements made with the menem government show the potential for peaceful cooperation without returning the islands . kirchner s sabre-rattling will probably decline after the presidential election in 2007. in any case direct relations with argentina are of little strategic or economic importance to britain except where they affect the falkland islands . trade policy is handled on both sides at a supra-national level through the eu and mercosur respectively . the falkland islands are simply not like other examples of decolonisation . elsewhere britain has given independence to the indigenous peoples of its former colonial possessions responding <eos>
