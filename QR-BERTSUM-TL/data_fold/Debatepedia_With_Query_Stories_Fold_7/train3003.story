<s> environment : is the three gorges dam benefiting the environment ? <eos>

<s> when droughts occur in china as occurred in # garbage can pile up in the basin behind the damn . then when the basin begins to fill back up with water this garbage is lifted to float on the surface where it is both visually unappealing and damaging to the environment . the damage is particularly acute for local wildlife that suffer from higher chemical levels in their habitat or that become ensnared in the garbage and die . <eos>
