<s> international law : is abolishing nuclear weapons consistent with international law ? <eos>

<s> if a country has no other means to defend itself against an imminent threat than by the use of nuclear weapons a defensive nuclear strike may be legally defensible . if for example the united states initiated a large-scale nuclear attack against russia russia would be legally justified in launching a large-scale nuclear strike against the united states in an effort to eliminate the threat and defend itself . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the threat or use of nuclear weapons is legal in desperate defense . <eos>
