<s> regime change : is assassination a good means to regime change ? <eos>

<s> if an attempt is made on the life of a tyrant one result is that the tyrant will become more paranoid and take measures to strengthen his or her grip on power . another result is that supporters of the tyrant and fence-straddlers may come out in support and unity behind their leader . this would leave a people worse off as far as deposing their tyrant . assassination attempts therefore entail great risks of back-firing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> failed assassination attempts can help strengthen a tyrant . <eos>
