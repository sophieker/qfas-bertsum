<s> hutches : is the raising of veal in hutches acceptable or cruel ? <eos>

<s> the american veal association for instance passed a resolution in # that calls for the veal industry to phase out the use of individual stalls . such a phasing out could occur in other places if we conclude that they are bad with the result that the veal industry is simply modified to be more cruel . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hutches could be abandoned without banning veal production completely . <eos>
