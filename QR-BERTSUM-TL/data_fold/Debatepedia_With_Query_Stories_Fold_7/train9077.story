<s> economics : is natural gas economically superior ? <eos>

<s> pipelines can not be built effectively across oceans . for this reason it is necessary to transport natural gas by ship . for the above reasons it is uneconomical to keep gas in its natural state so the only viable alternatives are to liquify ( lng ) or compress ( cng ) the gas . this allows more of it to be transported in each voyage . yet liquefying and compressing natural gas for transportation and then de-liquifying or de-compressing it for use is an inefficient approach . it requires extra technology process management and time that is not required in other alternative sources of energy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lng and cng are expensive methods of transporting/storing natural gas . <eos>
