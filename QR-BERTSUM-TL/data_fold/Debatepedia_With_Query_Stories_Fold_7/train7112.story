<s> universal care : is the public option the best ways to universal healthcare care ? <eos>

<s> `` the end of private healthcare insurance '' . wall street journal ( editorial ) . april # # : `` in a recent analysis lewin estimate that enrollments in the public option will reach # million people if it is closed to everybody and pays medicare rates . completely # million people will shift out of -- or lose -- private coverage . everything depends on the payment levels that congress adopts as well as the size of the eligible pool . but even if a public option available to all takes the highly improbable step of paying at some midpoint between private and medicare rate nearly # million people will still be overcrowded out of private insurance .
