<s> `` it is also argued that child labour in poor countries imposes emotional cost on developing-country consumers who find this offensive and is thus another transnational side-effect . if so the rich would do better to sending the children aid rather than impose harmful trading sanctions . '' [ `` the standard question '' the economist january # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> bans on imports is harmful . <eos>
