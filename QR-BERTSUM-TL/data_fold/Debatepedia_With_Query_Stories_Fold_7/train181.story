<s> rights : is accessing to water a right ? <eos>

<s> - while many argue that water is most efficiently supplied by public companies this is not necessarily the case and there are several instances in which privatization lead to serious disasters and public chaos . this argument contends that public healthcare is generally at greater risks with public ownership . part of this surrounds the nature of international trade agreements that often severely limit `` non-tariff trade barriers '' such as national safety standards that make the flows of water across borders more difficult . because privatization of water often leads to the weakening of these standards privatization also jeopardizes the rights of citizens that are protected by these standards . <eos>

<s> private ownership of water can threatens public health and citizens rights . <eos>
