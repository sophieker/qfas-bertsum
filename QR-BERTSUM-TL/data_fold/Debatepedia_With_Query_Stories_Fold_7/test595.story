<s> quality : do elections improve the quality of judges ? <eos>

<s> walter olson . `` judicial elections : a dissenting view '' . point of law . july 17 2008 : `` federal judges who of course are exclusively selected by appointment rather than election are widely seen as upholding a general standard of quality well above that of their state brethren . business defendants in particular overwhelmingly seek to have their cases heard in federal court rather than state . again business litigants widely regard the judicial process of most other advanced democracies -- in western europe japan canada -- as more predictable and rational than that of state courts in the u.s. and again in those other advanced democracies elected judgeships are virtually unknown being widely seen as part and parcel of the distinctive 'american disease ' of law .
