<s> development : is free trading generally good for the developing of poorer countries ? <eos>

<s> free trade creates a `` race to the bottom '' whereby developing countries lower their labour and environmental standards in an effort to attract foreign investment . in mexico free-trade zones are rampant with labour and environmental abuses many of them committing by american companies . further free trade can lead to unemployment and greater incomes disparity in developed countries . for example many carmakers have closed their michigan and ontario plants and moved their business to mexico .
