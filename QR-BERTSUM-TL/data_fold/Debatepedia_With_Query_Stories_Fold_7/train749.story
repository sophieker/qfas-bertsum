<s> easier ? would lives be easier and more hassle-free if we had identities cards ? <eos>

<s> at the moment we all carry many different cards and papers in fatty wallet or purses . but another smart card can carry all this info and more . it can replace all our cards identifying us everywhere we go - it could even be charged up with money or act as a train pass . and if we are in an accident or falling suddenly sick a smart card with our medical details on it could save our life .
