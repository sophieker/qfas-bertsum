' '' . the right wing professor . # oct. # - `` our federal government spend roughly $ # billion a year and the populations is roughly # million which works out to $ # # per person per year . with a median family in the us earn around $ # # /year and having # member it is clear that this family ca n't afford to pay its `` fair share '' of $ # # /year in taxes . without a drastic slashed of the federal budget we are forced into a progressive tax system where by progressive i simply mean the wealthy pay more in taxes than the not so wealthy .
