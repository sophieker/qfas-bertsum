<s> law : does israel have rights to current territory ? <eos>

<s> if israel was to return to its pre- # borders it would have to withdraw from the west bank and gaza both territories that it took it from the palestinians whom were not fighting the israelis in the war . all territory won during wartime ( and stolen from defenseless civilians ) is illegitimate annexation illegal under international law . the un `` moaned '' because the israelis were killing innocent civilians and acting as though international law/the geneva conventions were beneath them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> territory taken during # war was taken from palestinians . <eos>
