<s> `` dominion '' : do humans have `` dominion '' over animal justifying testing ? <eos>

<s> humans have evolved from animals and from a common single cell organism . humans did not have kingdom then over other animals ; presumable we did n't even exist . therefore how is it possible to claim that we now can have dominion ? at a minimum evolution forces us to recognizing that humans do not have an nuance claim to `` dominion '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> evolution scientific debunks the idea of human dominion over animals . <eos>
