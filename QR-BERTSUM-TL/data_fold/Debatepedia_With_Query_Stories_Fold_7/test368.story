<s> economics : is gay marriage economical ? <eos>

<s> while it is true that homosexuals would benefit financial by getting married and receiving the benefits of marriage that is actually a concern in many people 's eyes . the concern is simply that a change in law that allows same-sex marriage will suddenly create a major financial strain on taxpayers that fund marriage benefits . hundreds of thousands of same-sex marriages would result from any cross-the-board legalization . given the significance of the benefits provided to married couples the new strains would be substantial on tax-payers . <eos>

<s> gay marriage 's legal benefits would strain taxpayers <eos>
