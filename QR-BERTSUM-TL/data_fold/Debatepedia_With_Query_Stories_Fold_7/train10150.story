<s> feasibility : will the building of space elevator be feasible in the near future ? <eos>

<s> oscillations of the tether would pose a fundamental problem for a spaces elevator . apart from many other problem severe longitudinal circumferential and torsional oscillations could probably develop on the tether ( if only because of the lower # km being slashed by winds ) in a widest range of frequencies and such oscillations could eventually lead to its breakdown . the dampening of such oscillations would proving unsurmountable . <eos>
