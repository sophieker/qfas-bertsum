<s> family violence : does arranged marriage result in more abuse and marital violence ? <eos>

<s> domestic abuse occurs all over the world in relationships from various marriage systems and even in relationships where there is no `` official '' marriage . domestic abuse does occur in arranged marriages but it also occurs in couples who date who marry or who divorce . stopping domestic abuse is more of an issue connected to violence power and control then a marriage system . although it is tempting to blame arranged marriages on domestic abuse because there is an association between parents `` controlling '' who their children marry such a view is largely a stereotype and an unfair judgment of all arranged marriages . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no casual link between a marriage system and domestic abuse . <eos>
