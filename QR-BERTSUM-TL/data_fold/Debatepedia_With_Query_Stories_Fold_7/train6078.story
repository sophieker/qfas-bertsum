<s> would free public transport help the environment ? <eos>

<s> buses planes trains etc . all harm the environment just as cars do . if everyone used public transport more buses would pollute cities . it should also be mentioned that the manufacturing and creation of a public transport system is very energy intensive drawing largely on coal and fossil fuels for energy . this releases significant carbon emissions into the atmosphere . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we would need more public transport . <eos>
