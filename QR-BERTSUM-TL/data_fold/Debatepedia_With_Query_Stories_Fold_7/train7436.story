<s> democracy : are the leaks good for democracy/transparency ? <eos>

<s> the united states of america is surely a democratic country respecting the freedom of reporting . however the acts of wikileaks are not appropriate because it is revealing the national secrets to the world . this can cause serious problems around the globe because enemy countries such as north korea can use the information from the wikileaks for their own benefits . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikileaks can be exploited by regimes unfriendly to democracy . <eos>
