<s> health : are burqas and burqas detrimental to health ? <eos>

<s> accordance most laws nowadays everyone has a freedom to his or her own body . the choice to wear a burqa or niqab on her body is part of her freedom to her body . then why are we violating this most basics laws with a burqa ban ? even if we conclude that the burqa is bad for women 's healthcare and even for their babies so are many things that are legal like cigarettes and alcohol . that the burqa is bad for women 's healthcare however unfortunate that may be nevertheless does not give the governments the right to take away a woman 's right to her own body and to treats it how she wishes . <eos>
