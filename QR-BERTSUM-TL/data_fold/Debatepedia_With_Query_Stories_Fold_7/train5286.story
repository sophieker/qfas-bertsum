<s> steven pearlstein . `` wanted : personal economic trainers . apply at capitol . '' washington post . february # # -- `` let s reviews some of the more silly arguments about the stimulus bill starting with the notion that 'only ' # percent of the money can be spend in the last two years and the rest is therefore 'wasted . ' as any economist will tell you the economy tends to be uncertainties and emotional . so if businesses and households can seeing immediate benefits from a program while knowing that a bit more stimulus is on the way they are likely to feel more confident that the recovery will be sustained . that confidence in turning will make them more likely to take the risk of buying high-dollar items <eos>
