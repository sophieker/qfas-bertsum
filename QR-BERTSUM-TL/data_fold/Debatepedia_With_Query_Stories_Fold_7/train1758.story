'' the new york times editorial . may # # : `` too big to fail senators said tuesday that they had reached an agreement on how to pay for seizing and dismantling big banks whose imminent failure could destabilize the system but that doesn t confront the more difficult issue of how to cut big banks down to a less threatening size . the senate bill calls on regulators to impose higher capital requirements on riskier institutions . the aim is to make size and complexity so expensive that banks opt to restrict their size but the new rules are unlikely to be enough . '' <eos>

<s> # reforms limit size of banks and risks of failures <eos>
