<s> child abuse : do child beautiful pageants amount to child abuse ? <eos>

<s> `` child beauty pageants . um no . '' lovelyish . january # th # : `` i 'd also like to points out that a little girl shouting beg her mother not to 'tear it off ' as she 's held down in a chair for a brow-waxing is not just insensitive on the mother 's part - it 's abusive . putting your four year old child through hours of hair-dying waxing extreme dieting tanning and who knows what else is so she can look like cindy crawford is child neglect . why this is even legal is far me . i do n't see a difference between repeatedly ripping your kid 's hair out in the name of beauty and repeatedly hitting your child in the name of authority .
