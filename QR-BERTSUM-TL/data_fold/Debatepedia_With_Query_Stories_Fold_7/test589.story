<s> `` sexual ethics : consensual incest '' . a nadder . october # th # - `` it 's unnatural ; the same old line 's been used to prove the immorality of homosexuality interracial marriage contraception etc . sorry . the answer 's always `` so what ? '' ( being unnatural does n't make something bad ) and `` no it is n't '' ( eg . # # % of college students reported some childhood sexual please with a brother/sister ) . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> that bestiality is `` unnatural '' does not make it immoral <eos>
