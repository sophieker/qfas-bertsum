<s> natural ? is vegetarianism natural for humans ? is meat-eating unnatural ? <eos>

<s> some animals do kill others for food but at least prey species live free and any suffering in the hunt is almost always over quickly . and unlike lions or wolves humans are moral beings who are aware of the suffering they can cause and able to choose a different way of life . for this reason vegetarians dislike hunting animals for meat ( or for fun ) just as much as farming them . farming is actually worse than hunting as it inflicts long term cruelty on animals in a systematic way . not only are farm conditions cruel breeding for meat dairy or wool has created livestock which suffer all sorts of unnatural and painful diseases and conditions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> farming animals for meat is very unnatural . <eos>
