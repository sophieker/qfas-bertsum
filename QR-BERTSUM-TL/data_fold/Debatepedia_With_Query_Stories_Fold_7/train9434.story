<s> war on terror : is it wrong to think the war in afghanistan protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> withdrawing from iraq would concede a major victories to terrorists around the world that would be used as evidence of the `` success '' of a global jihadi movement and would be used to advance the continuation of the war on broader fronts and theaters around the world particularly in inspiring recruits to join the fight . instead of run we have to confront and overcome the terrorists in iraq sending a message that we are determined and are prepare to persevere in the face of hardship for a noble cause . this will dehumanize terrorists and cause them to peaceful and give up . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an early withdrawal from afghanistan would emboldened terrorists <eos>
