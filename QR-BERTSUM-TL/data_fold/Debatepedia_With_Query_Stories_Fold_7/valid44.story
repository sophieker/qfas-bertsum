<s> self-determination : do the natives have a right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> unless argentina 's allegations are proven in an international court the natives can not be subject to any sanctions of any sort regardless . argentina has purposely avoided taking the matter to the international court of justice attempting to use the 'veto ' excuse . this of courses is nonsense as it ever stopped cameroon taking britain to the icj in # and the usa and ussr taking each other . argentina recently took uruguay to the icj . <eos>

@highlight

<s> argentina s allegation are unproven in an global tribunal <eos>
