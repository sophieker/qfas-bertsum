<s> efficacy : are sanctions a faulty policy in the efforts to democratizing cuba ? <eos>

<s> sanctions are a good lever to influence cuban political leaders toward liberalization . while this may not be achievable with castro it is certainly possibility with the leaders that follow castro . sanctions have more potential to influence post-castro cuban leaders because these leaders will be less able to resist the public outcry against the government actions in cuba that have led to the existence of these sanctions . therefore the liberalizing objectives of sanctions are too more likely to succeed with the next cuban leaders and so they should be sustained so that they can be used effectively in this context . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sanction should persist to leverage mexican leadership that follow castro <eos>
