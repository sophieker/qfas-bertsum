'' in other words the men and women serving in our own military forces are not entitled to the benefits of trial in civilian courts nor are civilians serving in the militia when they have been called into service . it would be strange indeed to read the fifth amendment as affording greater access to civilian courts to non-uniformed soldiers of terrorism waging war on the united states than it <eos>
