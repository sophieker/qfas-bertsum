<s> military aid : is aiding pakistan 's military insufficient compared to a unilateral strike ? <eos>

<s> we currently provide # % of pakistan 's entire military budget and have provided over # million dollars in aid since # . this aid has failed to be appropriated to the correct places and accordance to the new york times frontier troops are fighting in sandals in the snow wearing world war i era pulpy helmets . the funds apparently go to for pakistan 's competition with india and not for fighting terrorism outlining the aid 's ineffectiveness . thus it is bad idea to think that military aid to pakistan could be a adequate substitute to a unilateral us strike .

<s> u.s. military aid is presently wasted in pakistan . <eos>
