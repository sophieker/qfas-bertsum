<s> sex crimes such as rape or molestation can be seen in part as a product of sexual frustrations . men in particular have a high sexual drive and yet many are often unable to satisfy that drive due to physical appearance social difficulties or other problems . after being denying sexual relations dozens of times for years on end some of these men become so desperately that they justify to themselves the commission of a sex crime . prostitutes can helping prevent the sexual frustration that leads to sex crimes by acting as anything of an exhaust valves for pent up sexual energies . <eos>
