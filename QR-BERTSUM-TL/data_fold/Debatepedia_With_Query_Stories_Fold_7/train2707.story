<s> fulfillment of scriptural prophecy <eos>

<s> opposite was an argument detailing a prophecy made by christ which was seemingly false because that generation died before all of the signs of the end of the age had occured however the footnotes of the niv translation of the bible mention that the word translation as `` generation '' would which be translation `` race '' . problems solved . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no biblical prophecies have so much failed to come true . <eos>
