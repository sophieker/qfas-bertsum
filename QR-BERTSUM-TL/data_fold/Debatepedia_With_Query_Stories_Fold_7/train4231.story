<s> independence : is a republic important to australian independence from britain ? <eos>

<s> when the queen travels abroad she focuses almost all of her energies on representing britain 's interests . the foreign policy interests of australia are of secondary concern and receive little attention . this means that the queen is not representing the interests of australians further the undemocratic nature of the monarchy in australia . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the queen represents british not australian interests abroad <eos>
