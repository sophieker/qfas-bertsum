<s> intelligence sources : is the secretive trials of detainees justified by the interests in protecting intelligence sources ? <eos>

<s> even when strong proof exists charging and trying terror suspect in open court would require governments to reveal their intelligence sources . this would risk the identification of their spies in foreign countries and within danger organisations . not only might this lead to the murder of brave agents it would also shut off crucial intelligence channels that could warning us of future attacks . even if special arrangements were made to particular intelligence evidence in court hostile organisations would be able to work out how much or little eastern intelligence services know about them and the manner in which they operate . in these circumstances detention without public trial is the only safe option . <eos>

<s> at a time when our society is under threats it is more important to protect our knowledge sources than it <eos>
