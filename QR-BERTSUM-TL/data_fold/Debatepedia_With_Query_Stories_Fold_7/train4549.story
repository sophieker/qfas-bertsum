<s> turbines : are tidal turbine stream generators a good idea ? <eos>

<s> there is a common concern surrounding wind turbines that they kill ( too many ) birds . this concern also exists in regards to the effect of tidal turbines on marine life . yet the much slower spinning-speed of water turbines does not significantly jeopardize marine wild-life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> offshore turbines spin slowly do n't jeopardize marine life . <eos>
