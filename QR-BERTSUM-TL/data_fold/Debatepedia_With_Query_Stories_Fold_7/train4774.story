<s> animals kill ... is animal testing justified on terms that animals harm so-to-speak too ? <eos>

<s> michael pollan . `` an animal 's place '' . the new york times magazine . november # # - `` my first line of defense was obvious . animals kill one another all the time . why treat animals more morally than they treat one another ? ( ben franklin trying this one long before me : during a fishing trips he wondered 'if you eating one another i do n't see why we may not eating you . ' he admits however that the rationale did n't occur to him until the fish were in the frying pan smelling 'admirably well . ' the advantage of being a 'reasonable creature ' franklin remarks is that you can find a reason for whatever you want to do . ) to the 'they do it too ' defense the animal rightist <eos>

<s> that animals harm/kill each other does not justify the same by beings <eos>
