<s> position : what is obama 's position ? has it been continual or shifted ? <eos>

<s> john obama and the republican 's position against obama 's position on meetings with foreign leaders relying almost entirely on the shallow premise that obama has `` changed positions '' . this has nothing to do with the principle of the matter of meetings with unfriendly foreign leaders for which obama presents no serious opposition case based on principled arguments . <eos>

@highlight

<s> mccain has no case against meetings hostile leaders ; relying on obama 's `` changing positions '' . <eos>
