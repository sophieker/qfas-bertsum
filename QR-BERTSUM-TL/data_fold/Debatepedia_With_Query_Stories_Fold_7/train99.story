<s> an american family business institute study by daniel clifton # / # > `` the joints committee on taxation ( jct ) scores to permanently repealing of the federal property tax have hugely overestimated the cost of repealing in the past just as they have overestimated the cost of other tax cuts . jct s new score of property tax repeat their past mistakes and inflates the cost of repealing by at least $ # billion . '' <eos>
