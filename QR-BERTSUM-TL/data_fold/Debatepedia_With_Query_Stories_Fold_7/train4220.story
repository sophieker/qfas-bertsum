<s> compassion : is vegetarianism an expression of human compassion ? <eos>

<s> animals are given food shelters and care if they become ill or injured . when it is time to slaughter them the ends is quick and pain-free . after all unhappy and stressed animals provide bad meat so it is in farmers interests to look after them well . some intensive farming methods are hard to defend but that is a fact for passing law to protect animals better . there is nothing wrong in principle with farming livestock . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cruelty to animal is mistake but 'ever is not always cruel/wrong . <eos>
