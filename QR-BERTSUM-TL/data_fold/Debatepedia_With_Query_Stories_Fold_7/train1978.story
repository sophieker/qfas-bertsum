<s> in schools : should the confederacy flag be banned in schools ? <eos>

<s> this is very different from the other disruptive influences identified here . they have no positive contribution . on the other hands pride in one s region is a legitimately even laudable passion . this is an attempt to refute southern heritage ; it shouldn t be allowed in school or anywhere else . in # the u.s. supreme court ruled in tinker v. des moines independent community schools district that schools officials could not prohibit students from wear white armbands to protest the cambodia war - why can t students show their support for their home ?

@highlight

<s> confederate flag represent pride in one 's community ; unlike miniskirts . <eos>
