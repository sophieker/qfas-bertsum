<s> social welfare : should migrants receive equal treatments on social welfare ? <eos>

<s> while it may be appropriate for migrants to receive certain society services while working in a country much of a nation 's society services should be made unavailable to them . society secure and medicaid for example are based on individuals paying into the system for years and thus having a legitimate claim to drawing from the programs in their time of need . migrant workers fall outside this equation so should not have the same rights to these benefit as complete citizens . <eos>

@highlight

<s> full entitlements should be rights for the citizens of a nation . <eos>
