<s> regional stability : is turkey and its surrounding neighborhood relatively stable ? <eos>

<s> the caucasus is very unstable with some of its nations looking to turkey for support for religious and cultural reasons . a middle eastern border would involve the eu in the israeli-arab conflict and give it a border with an aggressive and unstable iraq ( and iran ) with whom it would share an assertive kurdish minority seeking statehood . turkey even has major disputes with greece a current eu member over territory in the aegean and over the divided island of cyprus where it alone recognises and backs the turkish republic of north cyprus preventing a settlement .

@highlight

<s> turkey 's admission would expose the eu to new conflicts and dangers . <eos>
