<s> updates : does lisbon appropriately modernize past eu treaties ? <eos>

<s> `` sunday times : lisbon treaty : yes no or eh ? '' . kathy foley . 13 jan. 2008 - `` some hours later i made it to page 25. i was hungry tired dispirited and suffering a thumping headache . you tend to get migraines when you read sentences like the use of union competences is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality over and over again without ever coming to understand what they mean . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the lisbon treaty is too confusing and unclear <eos>
