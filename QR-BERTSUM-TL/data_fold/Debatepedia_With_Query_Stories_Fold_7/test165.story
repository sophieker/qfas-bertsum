<s> consensus model : is the consensus model of dialogue faulty or ideal ? <eos>

<s> justice and truth exist in the world . they are singular concepts that we must strive for . if everyone were just and fully aware of all the facts they would all be of the same opinion regarding the truth and the right direction to take society . therefore we should not settle with members of society having different opinions and should strive to foster dialogue toward the gaol of achieving a greater consensus around what is true and just . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` truth '' `` righteousness '' and `` the right path '' are legitimate notions making consensus possible . <eos>
