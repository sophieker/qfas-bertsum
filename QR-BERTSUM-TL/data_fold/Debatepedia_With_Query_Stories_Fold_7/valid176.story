<s> democracy : what will the effect be on elections/democracy ? <eos>

<s> `` corporate free speech . '' republicans and conservatives archives . january # # : `` it is understandable that there is opposition to this concept particularly from those who have no conception of the corporate power of government . [ yet ] i wholeheartedly support the supreme court 's decision lifting limits of corporate free speech . we have a great national corporation able to speak freely on behalf of its desire for power . it would be suicidal for us to limit our responses to such a concentration of expression to a cacophany on individual voices or to eschew an effective tool by which many individuals can focus their voices into harmonious opposition .
