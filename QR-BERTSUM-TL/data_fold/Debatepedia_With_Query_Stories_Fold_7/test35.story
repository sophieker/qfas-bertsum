<s> punishment : do hate crimes deserve a higher level of punishment ? <eos>

<s> all forms of violent crime whether they are murders rapes or beatings are an expression of hatred toward another human being . to add more punishment to a crime because it represents a particular kind of hate is to unfairly distinguish between different violent acts and trivialize those violent acts that do not appear to be motivated by prejudice hate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> all violence is hate-driven so why distinguish ? <eos>
