<s> abuse : will a ban on slapping stop child abuse ? <eos>

<s> a ban on smacking will do nothing to tackle cases of real abuse but will bring thousands of well-meaning parents into the justice system . in # # per cent of the # # child abuse reports were found to have no substantive basis with the majority being false accusations making for mistaken mischievous or malicious reasons . consequently # # children and their family had to endure the intrusive invasions by investigators resulting in serious and long-term harm to their emotional and social well-being . if incidents of smacking are treated as child protection matters then parents will be subject to investigations on a far broader scale . our already overburdened social services department will have even less time and resources to devote <eos>

<s> it will do nothing to tackling estate cases of child abuse . <eos>
