<s> changing menus : will mandatory calorie counts compel restaurants to improve menus ? <eos>

<s> `` calorie disclosures fail to weigh whole enchilada '' . wall street journal . july 8 2009 : `` scripps television stations sent several menu items to testing labs and found some big deviations from posted calorie content most of them making menu items appear healthier than they are . for example two tests of applebee 's cajun-lime tilapia meal found about 400 calories compared with the posted total of 310 . '' this means that restaurants may simply choose to lower their reporting of calories instead of actually lower the calories in the foods they are serving . <eos>

<s> restaurants frequently under-report calories on menus <eos>
