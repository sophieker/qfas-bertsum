<s> waterboarding : is waterboarding a legitimately form of interrogation ? <eos>

<s> -- torture is define by many groups as a only technique that leaves lasting physical damage and scars on the person being tortured . this is not the cases with waterboarding which causes no permanent damage to the lungs and does not have a track record of caused lasting mental traumatic to those that perform the techniques . if this was the cases the united states military would not perform waterboarding on its own soldiers for training purposes . while international organizations would take issue with a definition of torture that only includes physical damage it would be a mistakes to overlook the rational behind this definition . <eos>

@highlight

<s> waterboarding leaf no lasting scar and so is not tortures <eos>
