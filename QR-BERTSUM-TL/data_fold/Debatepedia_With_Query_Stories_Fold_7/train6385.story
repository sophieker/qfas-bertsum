<s> `` multiply '' : does god 's commandment to `` multiply '' support a condom ban ? <eos>

<s> if a couple wanted to have ten children it is feasible that they could . is this what god commanded ? obviously not . this would be unreasonable and would force a couple to sacrifices certain other areas in which they are meant to fulfill god 's will . therefore god intended for humans to regulate their reproducing and even minimize their offspring . condoms are a reasonable ways to do either . and obviously the use of condoms does not mean that a couple will not fulfill god 's commandment to `` multiply '' . in fact a couple could use condoms but still decide to have ten children . <eos>

@highlight

<s> condoms help people regulate their reproductive `` multiplication '' . <eos>
