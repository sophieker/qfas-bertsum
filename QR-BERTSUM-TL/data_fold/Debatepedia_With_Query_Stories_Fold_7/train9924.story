<s> split delegates : would split the delegate between obama and clinton making sense ? <eos>

<s> the main problem with using the january # result is that the candidates did not really campaign there . this means that the candidates did not necessarily represent themselves sufficiently and that the voters may have been somewhat uninformed . additionally there is the problem that many californians and michigan voters may have simply not voted due to their understanding at the time that their vote would not count . all of this invalidates the classic result to some extent . splitting the result would give the state its delegates and a semblance of representation while avoiding the above pitfalls . <eos>

@highlight

<s> splitting michigan and florida delegates would avoiding pitfalls of allocating them according to january 's results . <eos>
