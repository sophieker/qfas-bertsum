<s> utility in war : do land mines provide bit military utility ? <eos>

<s> they permits the defense of an area without requiring large numbers of personnel . this is a legitimate aim both in warfare when military personnel are spreading too thinly to protect all civilians and in poor countries during peacetime who would rather invest in their infrastructure than funding the military capacities that would otherwise be required to defend the same ground . in the future landmines may not be needed . however whilst army still depend on conventional weapons and movement moving tanks and large infantry groups and borders are weak the defensive tactic of landmines is highly appropriate : it is cheap affordable and maintains borders . their existence can slow or stop an advance delaying or even halting conflict ; they can deter invasion <eos>

@highlight

<s> landmines helping defend large swaths of territories at little cost . <eos>
