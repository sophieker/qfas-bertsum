<s> sex rates : which approach is generally more effective at reducing teen sex ? <eos>

<s> it 's ridiculous to think that those teenagers who are not thinking about sex and are unlikely to have an early first sexual experience are going to be rendered horny maniacs just because they are taught the unglamourous facts about sex . have you been to a sex ed lesson - it 's hardly the highlights of the kama sutra . teenagers are often at a time that they are thinking about sex and relationships anyway so for the benefit of those that may not have the sense to protect themselves but will have sex anyway educating about prevention of stis and pregnancy is the smart way of mananging the issue . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unglamorous sex-ed does not encourage sex . <eos>
