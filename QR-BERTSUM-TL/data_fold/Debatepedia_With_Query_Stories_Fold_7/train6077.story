<s> revenue : is it good that a tax could generate revenue and could this revenue be spent well ? <eos>

<s> given that the tax if implemented will most likely have to be enforced by each country individually with funds later to be transferred to the un there is little chance that the process would be apolitical . while the politics would changing the main contributing countries would continue to be the countries with the strongest currencies ( japan eu usa canada ) and their politics interest will stay put . given that the un has been ridden with corruption charges in the last few years countries may also express reservations to donating the money to the un .

<s> the revenue-collection process is possibly to be politicized : <eos>
