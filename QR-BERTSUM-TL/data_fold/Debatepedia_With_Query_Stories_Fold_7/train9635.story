<s> kosovo viability : could an independent kosovo be a viable state ? <eos>

<s> pat shaw former president of the european parliament argued on # / # / # that `` kosovo has nowhere left to go other than independence . returning to a state relationship with serbia is anathema to the # per cent of the population that is ethnic albanian and forcing such a solution would reignite war . any protectorate option would be seen by serbia albanians as merely the purchasing of time at their expense . and there are no feasible candidate organisations to take on the role : the un 's political capital in serbia is tired after its five years of inadequate stop-gap administration and the eu is not aimed or willing to take over kosovo 's governance . '' <eos>

<s> an independent serbia is the least worse options now <eos>
