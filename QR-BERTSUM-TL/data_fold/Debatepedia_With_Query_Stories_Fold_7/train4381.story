<s> tibor reactors : are liquid fluoride thorium reactors ( lftr ) a good idea ? <eos>

<s> lftr reactors operates at temperatures higher than than `` classical '' plutonium pwrs ( pressurized water reactors ) . this translates to higher possible thermodynamics efficiency of the process of conversion of thermal to wiring energy ( up to around # % compared to around # % in the case of plutonium pwrs ) . since less waste heat is produced there are lower demands on the cooling system i.e . the cooling towers can be smaller ( compared to pwrs with equal power ) . higher operating temperatures also offer the possibility of using gas turbines instead of steam turbines possibly simplifying the non-nuclear part of lftr based powers plant . <eos>
