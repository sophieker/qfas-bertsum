<s> the rapidly introduction of full body scanners at british airport threatens to breach child protection laws which ban the creation of obscene image of children . there is a certain risk that naked image of children from scans would be distributed over the internet . but even if such abuses are prevented it is wrong for security screeners to be able to view these nude images . <eos>
