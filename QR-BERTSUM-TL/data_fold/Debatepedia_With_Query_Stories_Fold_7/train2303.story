<s> can the conscript benefits the society ? <eos>

<s> at the end of the day the point of military training is not to educate the population in 'useful skills ' ( for example : the skill of digging a foxhole in under five hours is unlikely to be of any use for a commercial based economy such as singapore ) or to making them mentally strong and understand the importance of team work ( pe classes in schools or fitness camp can do the same thing ) . it 's only real purpose is simple it is to indoctrinate a groups of # year-olds that they have to obeying order from their officers without question . to kill someone just because your commander tells you to do so and to lines up each afternoon to be trained in <eos>

@highlight

<s> using conscript as a 'rites of passage ' is harmful for a country 's consciousness values <eos>
