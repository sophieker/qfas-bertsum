<s> level playing field : are subsidies unfair to clean energy ? <eos>

<s> `` green view : how to save $ 300 billion . '' the economist . nov 12th 2010 : `` some environmentalists try to turn this situation to their tactical advantage by comparing these figures to the much lower absolute level of subsidy given to renewables . this is a mistake in terms of logic and quite possibly in terms of tactics too . it is quite plausible to argue that the size of the subsidies in contention should be measured in terms of the amount of energy contributed . since renewables contribute hugely less to world energy use than fossil fuels do renewable subsidies ( $ 57 billion in 2009 ) are already larger than fossil-fuel subsidies on a per-kilowatt-hour or per-tonne-of-oil-equivalent basis . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> appropriate that oil more heavily subsidized than renewables . <eos>
