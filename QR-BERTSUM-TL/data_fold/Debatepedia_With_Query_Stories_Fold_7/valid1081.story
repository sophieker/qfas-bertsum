<s> npov : is wikipedia 's neutral point of view ( npov ) sound ? <eos>

<s> responding to concerns that `` wikipedia will end up like usenet ( newsgroups ) just a bunch of flame wars . '' this problem is a bit larger but it is dealt with fairly handily by the wikipedia 's social mores known as wikiquette . arguments on article pages are moved either to a corresponding talk page ( e.g . talk : theory of relativity ) or to a new article page presenting the arguments within a neutral context ( e.g . operating system advocacy ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia enables the presentation of arguments in a neutral context . <eos>
