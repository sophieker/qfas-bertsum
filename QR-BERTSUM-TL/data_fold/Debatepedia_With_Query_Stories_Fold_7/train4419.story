<s> environment : does eco-tourism benefits the environment ? <eos>

<s> the ecotourism industry is growing extremely easily with annual revenue growth in the double digits . this meaning that more people are going on tours into habitats . yet the more people that go on eco-tours the more ecological damaging will be incurred . therefore the irony of ecotourism is that its success entails the failure of it ecological mission . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the successful of ecotourism is worse for the environment <eos>
