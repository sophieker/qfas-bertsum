[ ... ] based on an u.s department of energy formulas it would be economical to produce fuel from coal when the price of a barrel of petroleum oil is at least $ # . [ ... ] with oil hovering nearby $ # per barrel we hope that america can roll out its first commercial-scale ctl refineries soon so that we can ensure our energy independence . '' <eos>
