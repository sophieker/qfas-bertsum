<s> states : is a regional standard better than states standards ? <eos>

<s> karen kerrigan . `` commentary : renewable electricity legislation would add to drain on large business . '' washington post . july # th # : `` a federal renewable electricity mandate would require that a percentage of a state 's electricity be produced from `` renewable '' sources . the federal governments would arbitrarily decide what source are considered 'renewable . ' the mandate does not take geography into account and fail to consider that many state do not have access to inexpensive renewable electricity sources . this means the legislation is inequitable ; it will punish small-business owners in state where renewable source are limited . '' <eos>

<s> national standards punishes state with less renewable energy <eos>
