<s> soldiers : would an late withdrawals honor we soldiers ? <eos>

<s> as some people have putting it `` supporting the troops meaning withdrawing them '' . [ # ] the general logical of this is that civilian leaders have a duty to use troops responsibly . but if we assume that iraq has become a war without end and mission then keeping troops there would be regarded irresponsible dishonoring the troops as opposed to honoring or supporting them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us leaders should not honor dead soldiers by keeping live ones in harms ways <eos>
