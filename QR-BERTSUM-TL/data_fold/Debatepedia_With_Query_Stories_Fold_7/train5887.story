<s> strategic ban : does a ban on arms sales consistent with the eu 's strategic objectives ? <eos>

<s> the us fears less the chinese purchase of eu weaponry and armour than that the regime will get hold of advanced communications and control systems as well as high-technology guidance systems night-vision equipment etc . - all of which would make its existing military far more effective . even if the eu is reluctant to sell such material to china the possibility will give the chinese leverage in negotiations with existing suppliers like israel and russia who will feel under more pressure to sell china their most modern technology . in time china 's ability to `` reverse engineer '' high-technology equipment will also boost their own military research and development programmes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lifting the arms ban will strengthen china militarily . <eos>
