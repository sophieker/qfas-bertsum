<s> practicality : are natural gas vehicles practical ? <eos>

<s> in order for natural gas refueling to be convenient a natural gas infrastructure will need to exist early on . assuming this will take time natural gas vehicle owners will have to deal with having far fewer natural gas stations . this will be prohibitive in some areas and a major hassle in others . <eos>

@highlight

<s> refueling will only be easy with a natural gas infrastructure . <eos>
