<s> economics : will the proposition benefit the us economy ? <eos>

<s> while driver 's licenses for illegal immigrants may reduce general insurance costs it will raise costs in other ways . offering licensing to roughly 15 million illegal immigrants in the united states would entail very high governmental administrative costs surrounding the teaching licensing and documenting of these additional individuals . this may negate any of the economic benefits cited in the affirmative . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the costs of providing driver 's licenses to millions of illegal immigrants would be very high . <eos>
