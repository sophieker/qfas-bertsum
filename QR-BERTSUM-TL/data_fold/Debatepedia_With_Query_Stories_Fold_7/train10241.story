<s> free choice : do prostitutes choosing their profession freely ? <eos>

<s> alison j. murray mba lecturer at the college of sydney in the chapter `` debt-bondage and trafficking : do n't believe the hype '' of the # book `` global sex workers : rights resistance and redefinition '' : `` blanket statements about prostitutes and the exploitation of women are propaganda from a political agenda which seeks to control the way people think and behave . the situations which the anti-traffickers railway against insofar as they do exist are a result of economic political and gender inequalities which should be our central cause for concern . the vast range of sex industries and contexts require an understanding of diversity and difference and a realization that prohibition and unitary 'moral values ' are part of the problems not the solution . '' <eos>
