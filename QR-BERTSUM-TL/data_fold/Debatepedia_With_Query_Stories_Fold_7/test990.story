<s> natural ? is vegetarianism natural for humans ? is meat-eating unnatural ? <eos>

<s> cow sheep chickens etc as we know them today could not live a life in the wild any more so if they were not kept as livestock these breeds of animal would steadily become extinct . is this the objective of vegetarians ? causing masses extinction ? is this moral ? or are domesticated farm animals meant to persist in their domesticated form for human consumption ? the later is correct . <eos>

@highlight
