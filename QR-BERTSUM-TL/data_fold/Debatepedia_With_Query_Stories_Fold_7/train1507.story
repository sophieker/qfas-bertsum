<s> compelling interest ? is the problem compelling making searches a compelling interest ? <eos>

<s> why would students put their weapons in their lockers ? would n't they just keep them on their person ? for this reason it does n't seem that locker-searches has much solvency for the problem of students bringing weapons into school ; it looks in the wrong place . <eos>

@highlight

<s> students more likely to carry weapons than keep in locker . <eos>
