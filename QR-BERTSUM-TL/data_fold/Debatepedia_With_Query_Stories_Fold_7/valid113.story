<s> crime : does gangsta hip-hop provoke criminality ? <eos>

<s> contemporary music can not be solely blamed for glorifying violence . gangsta rap indicates the successful hegemonic hailing of young african-american artists who have finally embraced and thus celebrating the very violence lifestyle that in principle was a part of slave-owning america . slave ownership was a biased macho enterprise consisting of the ownership and control of other human beings for own profit . similarly gangsta rap ironically upholds such principles through its stress on macho violence pimping ( owning and profiting from female sex slaves or prostitution ) drug dealing ( relying on addicts/junkies as slaves to drugs ) and profiting off of them through criminal activities and through the creation of a corrupt criminal network . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gangsta rap is whole of a long american tradition that glorifies violence . <eos>
