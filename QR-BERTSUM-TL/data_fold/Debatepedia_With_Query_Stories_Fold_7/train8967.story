<s> economy : is balanced budget amendment good for economy ? <eos>

<s> `` on a balanced-budget amendment . '' the economist . aug 2nd 2011 : `` i see the argument for a well-designed over-the-business-cycle balanced-budget amendment . but the idea of enshrining this congress ' pathologies into the constitution is terrifying . let 's see congress design some quality fiscal rules using the normal legislative process first and then we can talk about adding those to the constitution . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> congress should n't make amend if it ca n't make good fiscal leg . <eos>
