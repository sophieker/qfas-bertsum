<s> kathryn nicole stockhausen . `` should roman christian priests be allowed to marry ? '' . washington post . november # # : `` i have heard some who state that it would lead to an increase in vocations but there is not a single piece of statistical database to prove that . of those who have contemplated a vocations to the priesthood very few have stated that a vows of celibacy was a stumbling block that they could not overcome . in fact i have known of those ordained individuals who see celibacy as a blessing and as a way to allow them to focus more on their vocations of service to others and to the church .
