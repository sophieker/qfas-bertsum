<s> effectiveness : do earmarks allocate spending effectively ? <eos>

<s> sometimes a good piece of legislation that receives the support of a majority of congressman will be held up and voted down purely on the basis that it contains an egregious unrelated earmark . this undermines the democratic process in which ideas are judged and voted on based on their own merits . it also opens the door to unfortunate political maneuvering in which congressmen insert unfavorable or controversial earmarks into a piece of legislation as a means of holding up a bill they oppose . <eos>

@highlight

<s> earmarks are often unrelated to legislation ; holds up bill . <eos>
