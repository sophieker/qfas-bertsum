<s> `` algae : not only the best biofuel by far ... '' . ecoversity - `` but algae-culture holds the further promise of the potential of small-scale localized systems for food production as well as fuel production . there 's no quicker way to produce food from sunlight and the time may soon be coming to many parts of the world where food for humans becomes more a more urgent concern than the production of fuel . '' <eos>
