<s> translocation : is translocating kangaroos a poor alternative to culling them ? <eos>

<s> given the size of australia and range of wildlife and habitats to choose from translocation can be achieved relatively easily . while it is true that care must be taken to pick the right environments for kangaroos this can be continually planned for with a running list of prospective areas into which kangaroos can be moved . the natural habitats and conditions for the varieties of kangaroos present in australia are well documented and so are the matching characteristics of habitats that do n't currently have substantial kangaroo populations . connecting the dots should not be that difficult . <eos>

@highlight

<s> translocating kangaroos is not too difficult or impractical . <eos>
