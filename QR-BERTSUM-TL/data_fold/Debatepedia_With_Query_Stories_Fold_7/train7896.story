<s> taxes rebate : is the proposed taxes rebate a great idea ? <eos>

<s> it is sometimes claiming that tax rebates for the middle and lower classes are good for the economy because they go toward spending rather to savings . but this assumes a bogus view of savings . if someone deposits cash in their savings accounts at a bank the bank is infused with more money to lend out which stimulates the economy . and depositors frequently save by investing which stimulates capital flows economic growth and job creation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> measures that encouraging save help stimulating the economy <eos>
