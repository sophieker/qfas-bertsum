<s> joshua muravchik . `` opposing view : iranian bomb 'intolerable ' '' . usa today . november # # : `` only strikes against iran 's nuclear facilities can forestall these terrible scenarios . this would not require a 'declaration of war ' an antiquated concept that has not been employed since world war ii and rarely before . we would send no troops conquer no land . rather we would act in pre-emptive self-defense . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> air strikes on iran would be limited to self-defense <eos>
