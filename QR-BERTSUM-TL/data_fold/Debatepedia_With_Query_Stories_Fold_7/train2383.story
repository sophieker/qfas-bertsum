<s> emissions : can hybrid vehicles significantly reduce greenhouse emissions ? <eos>

<s> hybrid cars make us think we 're doing enough to fight global warming . while we think we are being `` green '' by driving hybrids in fact we are still burning gasoline in the vehicle and contributing significantly to global warming . this generates complacency among the public and politicians and reduces the urgency of finding truly # -emission alternatives . <eos>
