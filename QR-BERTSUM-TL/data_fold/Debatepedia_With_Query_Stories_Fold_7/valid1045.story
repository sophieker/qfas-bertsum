<s> problem-solving : are debaters generally better at solving crises than other people ? <eos>

<s> most debaters tend to research the topics given as much as possible thus making it harder for themselves to finally come to a conclusion ( as every good debater is able to argue both for and against any motion ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debating is not about solving problems quite the contrary . <eos>
