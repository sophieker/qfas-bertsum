<s> security : are pre- # borders best way to security ? <eos>

<s> the middle east and the world more generally is a far different place than it was in # . there is a significantly smaller risks that arab state will gangs up in a conventional war against israel . this owes significantly to the fact that israel is much more powerful militarily arab state are less powerful fairly and the military alliances and dynamics in the regions tend to favor israel more . all of this means that maintain a cache in israel with the post- # borders for the sake of defending against a collective arab assault is highly unreasonable . israel does not need this buffer . it can return to its pre- # borders . <eos>

@highlight

<s> coordinated arabic attack unlikely ; pre- # borders fine . <eos>
