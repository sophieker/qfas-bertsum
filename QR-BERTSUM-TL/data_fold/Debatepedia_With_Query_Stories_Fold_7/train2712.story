<s> jobs : does mountaintop removal cost/create jobs ? <eos>

<s> mountain justice : `` traditional mining communities vanish as job lessen and residents are driving away by dust blasting and increased floods and dangers from overloaded coal trucks careening down small windy mountain roads . mining companies buy many of the houses and tear them down . dynamite is expensive than people so mountaintop removing mining does not create many new jobs . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> mountaintop mining is generally not a huge job-creator . <eos>
