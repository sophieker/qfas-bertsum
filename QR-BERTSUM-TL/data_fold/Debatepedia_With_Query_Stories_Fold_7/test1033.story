<s> humaneness : could the cull of kangaroos be done humanely ? <eos>

<s> the beef would be utilized for humans consumption and pets food and the pelts for soft toy and other items . these kangaroos will not simply be killed and wasted . their lives beef and pelts will be put to a use and this will give meaning to the lives of these kangaroos making the culling at least more humane than if these resources were simply thrown away . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the meat and hair of culls marsupials will not be wasted . <eos>
