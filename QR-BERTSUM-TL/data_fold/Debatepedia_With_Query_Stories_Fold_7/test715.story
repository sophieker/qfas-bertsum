<s> investment sources : is it economical to limit foreign investments and inward investment ? <eos>

<s> even if they are able to invest because for example the cap has not yet been reached investors will consider that the government has a nationalistic economic policy that they are willing to vary to suit the home economy . prospective investors will therefore wonder whether in future the government might make other economic interventions against their interests e.g . expropriating property ? they will be less keen to invest when they can invest in more transparent regimes elsewhere .

@highlight

<s> the message a cap sends out will scare off investors . <eos>
