<s> wealthy : is a progressive tax system fair to the wealthy ? <eos>

<s> it is unfair that people who earn more should pay at a progressive rate . even on a standard rate they already pay more tax because they have a higher taxable income . therefore progressive tax rates are a form of double taxation as higher earners pay tax on more income and then at a high level . this is further unfair to them since high earners are the least likely group to benefit from much taxpayer-funded activity e.g . welfare . <eos>

@highlight

<s> flat tax fairly has wealthy pay proportionally more in taxes . <eos>
