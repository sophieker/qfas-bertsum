<s> judicial overload : would the legalization of cannabis relieve strained courts ? <eos>

<s> those marijuana offender are not convicted of a crime . this means that most of the money being put into law enforcement to battle marijuana results in no convictions . it is estimated that $ # . # billion is spent each year policing marijuana crimes but most of these crimes lead to no conviction . therefor millions of dollars are thrown into a system that typically makes no difference in the issue of marijuana ; all the while putting the government deep into finance debt . by legalizing marijuana the tax that can be put into place would possibly be able to bring in an estimated $ # billion according to offered diego legislation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cannabis consumers are typically not sentenced of a crimes <eos>
