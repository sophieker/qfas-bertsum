<s> science : does a manned missions to mars have scientific value ? <eos>

<s> glenn zorpette . `` why go to mars ? '' scientific american . march # : `` another reason why humans be have to be on site to conduct a exhaustive search for life stems from the fact that if any such life exists it is probably deep underground . upcoming probes will be equiped with robotic assemblies that can bore several centimeters into rocks or dig a few meters down into the soil . but barring any discoveries at those shallow depths researchers will have to bring up samples from hundreds of meters below the surface maybe even one or two kilometers down before they can declare mars dead or alive . drilling for samples at such depths 'most likely will require humans ' says charles elachi executive <eos>
