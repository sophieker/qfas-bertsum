<s> retention : does `` do n't ask do n't tell '' harm or improve retention ? '' <eos>

<s> soldiers should be judging on their performances not on their sexual orientation . `` do n't tell do n't tell '' completely ignores performances judging and even discarding soldiers based on their entirely irrelevant sexual orientation . a good military should be a meritocracy rewarding good achievement and ability . `` do n't tell do n't tell '' fails to live up to this notion and surely suffers in its quality as a result . <eos>
