<s> developing growth : will developing world growth negate develop state cuts ? <eos>

<s> both india and china are already establishing very strict emissions requirements largely because they are so vulnerable to the locally effects of their small emissions . reducing smog in their own towns is enough of an incentive for them to make such emissions reductions . therefore even with a lower `` obligation '' for developing nations they are still taking strong actions to combat climate change . <eos>

@highlight

<s> even with higher obligation developing states are going `` green '' <eos>
