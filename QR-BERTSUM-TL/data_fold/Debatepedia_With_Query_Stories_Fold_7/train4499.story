<s> high cholesterol or a high intake of fat can be incredibly harmful lead to heart disease diabetes and other conditions ; but manufacturer of these products are not punished . consumers simply like the tastes of fatty food . people should be allowed to smoke cigarettes and to eat fatty foods - both these things are sources of pleasure which while having serious associated health risks are only fatal after many decades unlike a poisonous foods or an unsafe car which pose immediate and high risks .
