<s> power and corruption : would terms limits ensuring that politicians do not become too potent and possibly corrupt ? <eos>

<s> there is the potential while in office that politicians will lose touch with the people and principles which got them elected in the first place . representatives who spend too many years in office lives in the national capital far from their constituents and surrounded by lobbyists and party managers easily become whole of a professional governing class remote from the concerns of normal people . term limits could recreate a class of citizen-legislators who see politics as a brief chance to making their country better rather than as a long-term comfy careers for themselves .
