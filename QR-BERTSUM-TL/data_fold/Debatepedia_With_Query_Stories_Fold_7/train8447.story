<s> urgent stimulus : does the bill provide sufficient urgent stimulus ? <eos>

<s> steven pearlstein . `` wanted : personal economic trainers . apply at capitol . '' washington post . february # # - `` let s reviews some of the more silly arguments about the stimulus bill starting with the notion that 'only ' # percent of the money can be spend in the next two years and the rest is therefore 'wasted . ' as any economist will tell you the economy tends to be forward-looking and emotional . so if businesses and households can see immediate benefits from a program while knowing that a bit more stimulus is on the ways they are likely to feel more confident that the recovery will be sustained . that self-confidence in turn will make them more likely to take the risk of buying big-ticket items <eos>

<s> longer-term spending is not `` waste '' ; help sustain bailout <eos>
