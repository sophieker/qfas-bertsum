<s> soldiers : would an late withdrawal honor us soldiers ? <eos>

<s> under the assumption that most troops in afghanistan are suffering from severe depression psychiatric trauma and risk of death it is no surprise that troops would prefer to come home . a timetable would give troops something to look back to and subsequently boost morale not increase it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> setting a timetable would boost troops morale not damage it <eos>
