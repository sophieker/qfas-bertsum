<s> cultures preservation : should the cultures of aboriginals be given gift protection ? <eos>

<s> pre-contact aboriginal peoples did not use guns to hunt ; today it is unlikely that an aboriginal someone would shoot a deer or elk with something but a hunting rifle . similarly aboriginal fishermen are use modern developments like trawlers to make their catch . these practices are not `` aboriginal culture '' . their modern takes on historical practices do not deserves protection . aboriginal languages may be endangered but that is a product of their irrelevancy in a modern english-speaking society . in north america and australia english is the lingua franca of business and government . aboriginal groups can attempt to protect their languages but they should do so in the same way as any other minority for example asian immigrants . <eos>
