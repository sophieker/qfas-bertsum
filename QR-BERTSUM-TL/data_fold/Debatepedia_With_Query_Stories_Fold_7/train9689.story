<s> choices issues : would salvation marriages be truly optional if implemented ? <eos>

<s> if more people choosing covenant marriage it simply proves that they reject the looser morality values of the liberals establishment . it would be constitutionally for the government to discriminate in favour of one form of marriage over another and in practice most people will have no idea what kind of marriage their neighbours and other kids parents have . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no one is going to be forced to have a covenant marriage but it should be available to those as <eos>
