<s> vs. mandates : is public insurance superior to mandating purchasing public insurance ? <eos>

<s> robert creamer . `` three reasons why a strong public option is likely to be part of health insurance reform '' cnn post . august # # : `` once everyone is required [ by mandates ] to buy insurance the companies can have a field day raising prices and profits using the government to guarantee they are paid - either through subsidies or the imposition of fines . you can seeing why from an insurance company perspective this would be a good deal . but from the point of view of the taxpayers - and the insurance ratepayers - it would be a disaster . it would be like give the insurance companies a license to take your money - with no regulation - all enforced by government edict . '' <eos>

<s> mandates wrongly give insurer billions of new customers <eos>
