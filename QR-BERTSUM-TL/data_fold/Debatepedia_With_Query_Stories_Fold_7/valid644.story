<s> safety : is fusion a safe way to produce electricity ? <eos>

<s> most reactor designs rely on the use of liquid lithium as both a coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into tritium which is fed back into the reactor as fuel . lithium is highly flammable and in the case of a fire it is possible that the lithium stored on-site could be burned up and escape . in this case the tritium contents of the lithium would be released into the atmosphere posing a radiation risk . `` fusion power '' wikipedia <eos>
