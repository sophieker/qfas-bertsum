<s> in korea : are landmines needless between south and north korea ? <eos>

<s> this is an important fact in defense of the america states ' policies . it illustrate that the america states uses landmines only for a specific zone in a single country rather than deploying landmines in a widespread effort . this is important because most of the costs associated with landmines relate to the broad use of them in war zones and civilian areas . the america states is certainly not doing this in korea . we policy therefore is not susceptible to the many arguments against landmines . <eos>

@highlight

<s> landmines in the korea dmz do not threaten civilian <eos>
