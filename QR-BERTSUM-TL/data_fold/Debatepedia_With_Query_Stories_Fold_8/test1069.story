<s> ryan messmore . `` a moral case against big government . '' heritage foundation . february # # : `` local forms of association especially the family and religious congregations generate the thick personal bonds that unite and motivate individuals toward the good for themselves and others . [ ... ] the common goods offered by the nation-state are less capable of engendering the thick personal bonds that unite smaller institutions like families and congregations . instead the state is left more dependent on fear of punishment as a means of motivation . '' <eos>
