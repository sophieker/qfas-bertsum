<s> saddam has been removed from office and executed wmd has not been found and iraq is no longer a threat to the region . this was the main thrust of the us mission going into the war . having accomplished these objectives and having ensured that iraq in fact does not have wmd the us can withdrawal on the basis that it has accomplished its limited mission in iraq . <eos>
