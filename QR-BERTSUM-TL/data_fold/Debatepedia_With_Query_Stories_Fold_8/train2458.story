<s> government involvement : will co-ops lead to more government involvement ? is this ok ? <eos>

<s> senator jim demint ( r-s.c. ) said the following about the democratic co-op proposals : `` now they they may try to call it a co-op . they can call it a public option . but you know they are all on record saying they want a single-payer government system . so any republican now that helps them pass a bill is helping them pass a government takeover of health care . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> advocates of co-ops are really aiming for socialized medicine <eos>
