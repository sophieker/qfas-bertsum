<s> humanitarian rights : were there human rights abuses in chechnya that demanded an global response ? <eos>

<s> this can not be achieved by an intervention in their territory . chechnya is sovereignty territory and vladimir putin won a clear mandates to pursue the war . there are countless countries where human rights violations occur include the u.s.a. and it is simplistic to suggest that only by intervening in all can the general principle be affirmed . it is clear to anyone that the power of russia protects it and not the permission of the international community .

@highlight

<s> russia will use its veto in the security council to attempt to block any humans pro-poor intervention in chechnya . <eos>
