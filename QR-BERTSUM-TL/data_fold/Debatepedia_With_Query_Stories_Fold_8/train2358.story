<s> morality : is increasing aid immoral justified ? <eos>

<s> the un does not have unlimited funding . as moral of a cause as development aid might be there are other equally important cause that must be given moral regard as well . limiting funding for development in order to advance these other cause ( global warming etc ) is not immoral . <eos>

@highlight

<s> un 's moral obligations to the poor are limited by funding . <eos>
