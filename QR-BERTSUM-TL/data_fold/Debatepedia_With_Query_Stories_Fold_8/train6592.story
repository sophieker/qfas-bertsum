<s> rehabilitation : are adult trials going to improve rehabilitation ? <eos>

<s> if the juvenile in the adult system gets a life sentence without parole he or she sees no point in going through the rehabilitation process given that he/she is never going to reintegrate into the society in the future . this is psychologically damaging for the juvenile and at the same time increases the likelihood that other juveniles ( sentenced to only a couple of years ) will be spoiled by those who - no matter what - have no hope in getting out . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no point in rehabilitation in certain cases . <eos>
