<s> accomplishments : did obama obama deserve the peace prize based on his accomplishments ? <eos>

<s> according to nobel 's will the peace prizes should be awarded to the person who : `` during the preceding year [ ... ] shall have done the most or the best working for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotions of peace congresses . '' and yet during this year obama barack was only campaigning was not the president of the united states and had not yet implemented any concrete step toward peace . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama only campaigning in # years for which he received peace prize . <eos>
