<s> vs. restriction : is ban more non-sensical than restrictions ? <eos>

<s> it is easy to catch people using lasers pointers or even just people possessing them but the old law allowed possession of lasers pointers just as long as they were used proprerly . before the law was in place it was often very hard to catch lasers offenders and those of them gotten away with their crimes . now it is much easier to catch lasers users without permits . <eos>
