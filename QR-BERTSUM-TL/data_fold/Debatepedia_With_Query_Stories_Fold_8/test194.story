<s> feasibility : is it possibility to abolish the vetoed power ? <eos>

<s> the abolition of the powers of veto is highly unlikely . the p # states will not willingly ceding their pre-eminent positions in international politics . articles # and # of the united nations charter grants the p # veto over amendments to the charter requiring them to approve stripping away their own veto powers . given the influence wielded by a veto-bearing state it is unlikely that any of the p # would agree to give up this privilege . <eos>

@highlight

<s> p- # nations will not allow the abolishing of their un sc vetoes <eos>
