<s> debt : do developed states have a responsibility to increase aid ? <eos>

<s> it does n't matter whether a country is developing or developed . this is not the factor that obligates a country to take up a `` higher '' responsibility for combating global warming and aiding in adaption . rather countries that emit the most - whether developed or developing - contribute more to climate change and so have a greater obligation to combat it and aid in adaptation efforts . <eos>

@highlight

<s> high emitters not developed countries are most obligated . <eos>
