<s> # war : were britain 's actions in the # war illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> . the junta was ordered to removing their forces from the islands under resolution # . as this did not happen the british forces intervened . as for the belgrano it was outside of that exclusion zones but that was no law ! britain had the right to attack anything in self defence including military bases in argentina if want be . <eos>
