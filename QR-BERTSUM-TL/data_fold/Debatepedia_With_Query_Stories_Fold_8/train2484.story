<s> scalability : can biofuels serve as a major energy source relieving foreign oil dependency ? <eos>

<s> biofuels can only have an impact on foreign oil dependencies if the fuel can scale . there are many obstacles to this that are argued in this case . if biofuels are not really `` greener '' than gasoline the case for replacing gasoline with biofuels would be significantly undermined as it would not move us forward in solving global warming . if biofuels are uneconomical then scaling biofuels as a replacement for foreign oil would be impossible ? finally biofuels depend on scarce land-resources which make it difficult for biofuels to scale in a way that could significantly relieve foreign oil dependencies . <eos>

<s> biofuels are not viable enough to relieve foreign oil dependencies . <eos>
