<s> corruption : can means test helping reduce corrupt and fraud ? <eos>

<s> this is particularly in middle incomes countries with social safety nets like central and eastern europe . means testing would be another way of reporting incomes and triangulating accurate economic data for those countries . while the short term temptation to cheat may increased the more extensive detailed and demanding reporting methods needed for means testing will make fraud more difficult . the systems developed for means testing will reduce corruption encourage efficiency in the civil service and eventually reduce fraud . <eos>

@highlight

<s> means test requires better collection of incomes information . <eos>
