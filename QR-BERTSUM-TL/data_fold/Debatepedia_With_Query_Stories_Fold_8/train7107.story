<s> tax rebate : is the proposed tax rebate a good idea ? <eos>

<s> this is particularly true in bush 's # bailout package which aims to give a tax rebate to the lower and middle classes specifically because these classes are more possibly to capriciously spend the money on consumers goods . yet given the debt-laden finance circumstance of the lower and middle classes they should be using this money to pay down debts or simply should be saving the money . therefore the bailout from a tax rebate depends direct on lower and middle-class consumers spend irresponsibly . exploiting irresponsible behavior should not be the aiming of economic bailout packages . <eos>

@highlight

<s> taxes rebate encourage irresponsible consumer spending habits <eos>
