<s> storage : can hydrogen fuel be effectively stored in cars ? <eos>

<s> amory lovins ceo of rocky mountain institute . `` twenty hydrogen myths '' . # june # - `` myth # . compressing hydrogen for automotive storage tanks takes too much energy . compressing hydrogen to fill tanks to # bar using standard # # % -efficient intercooled technology takes electricity equivalent to about # # % of the hydrogen s energy content . however most of that compression energy can be recovered aboard the car by reducing the pressure back to what the fuel cell needs ( ~ # . # # bar ) not with a throttling valve but with a miniature turboex . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is not too energy-intensive to compress hydrogen <eos>
