<s> the struggling ? is a mandate helpful or harmful to the financially struggling ? <eos>

<s> marcia angel . `` should health insurance be mandatory '' . new york times . june 4 2009 : `` a mandate is also extremely regressive . in massachusetts mandated insurance and co-payments can amount to nearly a third of income . income taxes apportion the costs of public services more fairly and i see no reason not to adopt that approach in paying for health care . to be sure president obama has said he would exempt people from the mandate who couldn t afford to purchase their own health insurance . but aren t these precisely the people most in need of it ? massachusetts has exempted 62 000 people from the mandate for that reason .
