<s> privacy : does dna databasing uphold the confidentiality of citizens ? <eos>

<s> while the main argument against a national dna database is that it violates the right to privacy this argument does not hold up well to scrutiny . the mere act of collecting dna information does not in any way violate the rights of individuals to act in any way they choose in their own private lives . it does not create any adding means or incentives for the government to entering into these private affairs but only allows the government to identity an individuals that has going beyond their private rights and violated the rights of other citizens through the commissions of some crime . <eos>

@highlight

<s> dna database does not hinder public acts of individuals . <eos>
