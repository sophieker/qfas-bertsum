<s> religion : does homosexual check out on religion grounds ? <eos>

<s> the economist `` the case for gay marriage '' # / # / # -- `` it is no business of the state to impose a religious choice . indeed in american the constitution expressly bans the involvement of the state in religious matter so it would be especially outrageous if the constitution were now to be used for religious end [ that aim to ban gay marriage ] . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> biblical passage that are claimed to condemn homosexuality are being misinterpreted . <eos>
