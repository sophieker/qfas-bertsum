<s> attention : does criminalization help muffle holocaust deniers ? <eos>

<s> an act of genocide on the scale of the holocaust is a crime against all humanity and all humanity has a responsibility to combat it . if a country gives holocaust denial illegal wherever it limits the ability of holocaust deniers to putting forth their views because of the risks of deported or extradition or arrest on travel to that country . for example wilhelm zundel was deported from canada and then arrested in germany . this is appropriate because something on the scale of the holocaust require a concerted effort by all humans to prevent it happening again . <eos>

@highlight

<s> criminalization allows the global pursuing of holocaust deniers . <eos>
