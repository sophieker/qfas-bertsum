<s> social : are there broad social reason for providing illegals with driver 's licenses ? <eos>

<s> - this debate often assume that driver 's licenses would simply be offered to illegally mexico immigrants with the claim that the us economy is dependent on these `` productive '' illegally immigrants . but what about other groups of illegally immigrants that may be `` less desirable '' ? what about an illegally immigrant from for example iran ? the problem is that the proposition tends to base its arguments off of only one particular group of illegally immigrants ( mexican immigrants constituting around # % of the illegally immigrant population in # [ # ] ( while seemingly deny the costs of accepting other groups of illegally immigrants into this program . <eos>

@highlight

<s> driver 's licenses would have to be offered to all illegal immigrants ( not just mexican ) <eos>
