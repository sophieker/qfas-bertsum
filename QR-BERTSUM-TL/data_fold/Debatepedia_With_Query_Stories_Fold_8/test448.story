<s> strategy : is the blockades strategically invaluable to israel ? <eos>

<s> israeli is not the only country blockading gaza . gaza 's other neighbor egypt is also blockading gaza on the courts that hamas is a threats to its security . this demonstrates at the very least that israeli is not nothing in its analysis and it also is notably in the way that egypt is a predominantly-muslim country ; the fact that it insists hamas is a threats must mean that hamas really is a threats deserving of being blockaded . <eos>

@highlight

<s> israeli blockades is support by egypt blockades of gaza <eos>
