<s> feasibility : is a mission to mars less technologically feasible ? <eos>

<s> `` manned mission to mars . '' on to mars : `` but reaching mars is a bit easier thanks to earth 's rotation around the sun . as a rocket escapes earth to reach another object in space earth gives it an extra speed because of its 30 km/sec orbital speed . when we try to reach mars we profit from this effect but when we reached the moon we do n't . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> orbit of earth around sun makes speed faster to mars than moon <eos>
