<s> politics : does ( and should ) the vox vox matter ? <eos>

<s> such devices as referenda or initiatives are intended not to bring governments closer to the people but to give undemocratic governments a veneer of democratic respectability . estate power is still with the elites who decide who will stand for which seats and thus who is guaranteed to be elected via safer seats . in britain we but have an undemocratic second chamber the house of lords which is able to interfere substantially with the process of passing laws . these lords are appointed direct by the political parties . truth democratic we repeat again is an unworkable systems on the scale of a country and we should abandon pretences at it for a more practical system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democracy is just an illusion . <eos>
