<s> economics : is high-speed rail economically advantageous ? <eos>

<s> jack mobley . `` a case against high-speed rail . '' merced sun star . december 11th 2010 : `` the project is doomed to be another expensive government project in search of a need . if it were a viable option the railroad companies would still be offering passenger service . high-speed rail will be an albatross around the financial neck of california for generations and the promise of 600 000 jobs being created is a pipe dream . we should stop this effort now before billions of dollars are spent constructing a means of transportation relatively few will ride and which will require many more billions of dollars in ongoing annual subsidies by the state of california .
