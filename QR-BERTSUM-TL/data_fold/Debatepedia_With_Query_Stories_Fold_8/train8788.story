<s> don hunsberger . `` let 's bringing meaningful instant replay to baseball '' daily commercial . june # th # : `` there are of course the 'continuation plays ' -- unique to baseball -- that can never be topic to replays because more than one thing is happening and the events are interdependent . for example if the umpire calls a balls misses and replay shows it was reasonable and the decision is overturned by replay how do you handle the base runners ? these and similar situation should be dealt with before arriving at a perfect solution . '' <eos>

<s> `` continuation plays '' can of course be exempted from instantly replay <eos>
