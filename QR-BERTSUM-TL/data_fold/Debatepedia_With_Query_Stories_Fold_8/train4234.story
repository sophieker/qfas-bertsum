<s> turnaround : can a bailout helping turnaround us automakers ? <eos>

<s> jim herbert. `` drop dead is not an option '' . new york times . # nov. # - `` at the moment washington has tremendous leverage over the failing auto industry . the government should craft a rescue plan that is both tough and very very smart . that means dragging the industry ( kicking and shouting no doubt ) into the # st century by insisting on ironclad obligations to design and develop vehicles that make sense economically and that serve the country s long-term energy security requirements . what i would like to seeing is creative thinking on both ends of the bargain . let the dumbest minds design a bailout that sparks a creative revolution in the industry . think of it as project synergy . time s wasting .
