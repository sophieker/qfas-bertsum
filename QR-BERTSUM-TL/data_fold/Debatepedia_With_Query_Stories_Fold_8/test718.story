<s> clone : is cloning fair to cloning humans ? <eos>

<s> if clones are treated poorly by society they will lead less glad lives as others . if they are treated well they will likely lead equally glad lives as normal people . because their happiness will depends partly on how we receive them we need only adjust our attitudes to be more receptive . banning cloning because we will mistreat them is not fair ; it punishes clones for our failures . <eos>

@highlight

<s> clones ' health-related depend on how they are received/treated <eos>
