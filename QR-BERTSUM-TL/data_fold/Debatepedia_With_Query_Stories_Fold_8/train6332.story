<s> military feasibility : would an attack be capable of disabling iran 's nuclear program ? <eos>

<s> the nonproliferation policy education center argues on 9/13/04 that `` as for eliminating iran s nuclear capabilities militarily the u.s. and israel lack sufficient targeting intelligence to do this . in fact iran has long had considerable success in concealing its nuclear activities from u.s. intelligence analysts and international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) inspectors ( the latter recently warned against assuming the agency could find all of iran s illicit uranium enrichment activities ) . as it is iran could have already hidden all it needs to reconstitute a bomb program assuming its known declared nuclear plants are hit . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the u.s. and israel do not have enough intelligence to successfully attack iran . <eos>
