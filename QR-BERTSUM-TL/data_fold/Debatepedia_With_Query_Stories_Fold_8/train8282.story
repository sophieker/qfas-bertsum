<s> dominion : do humans have dominion over animals ( and a right to hunt them ) ? <eos>

<s> humans have evolved from animals and from a common single cell organism . humans did not have dominion then over other animals ; in-fact we did n't even exist . therefore how is it possible to claim that we now can have dominion ? at a minimum evolution forces us to recognize that humans do not have an innate-historical claim to `` dominion '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> evolutionary science debunks the idea of human dominion over animals . <eos>
