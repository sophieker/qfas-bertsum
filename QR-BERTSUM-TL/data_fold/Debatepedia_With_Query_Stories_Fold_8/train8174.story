<s> workers : are workers in smoky public places being wronged ? <eos>

<s> various forms of physical mental tangible and less tangible forms of harm are frequently involved in the jobs that workers choose to perform . yet these harms are often accepted as meaningful sacrifices that workers are free to take-up when they deem these harms to be outweighed by the benefits of such employment . as long as their ability is maitained to calculate such benefits and costs and make a free `` choice '' to stick with such a job then the arrangement could be argued as just . if workers in smoke-filled environments are free to make such calculations of costs and benefits then it can be argued that their arrangement is fair and that cigarette bans in such public environments should not be <eos>

@highlight

<s> smoky work environments are not different that other harmful lines of work . <eos>
