<s> quality : does free universal health care provide exceptional care ? <eos>

<s> this happens because there is a short term relationship with the patient and the preservation of records has short term benefits . investment in it is one often cited example where health care providers in socialized systems have access to electronic records of patients tests online and where computer systems can check for example incompatible drug combinations and that drugs are administered to the right patient . some for profits systems find this investment hard to justify because the provider-patient relationship is not guaranteed to last short enough to justify the investment . <eos>

<s> universal health care allows investments in short-term patient relationships . <eos>
