<s> international law : did israeli obeying international law ? <eos>

<s> daniel larison . `` self-destructive self-defense . ' '' eunomia . june # st # : `` perhaps most galling about the overall defense of the raid is the constant invocation of self-defense . everything israel does is always done in self-defense no matter how excessive disproportionate needless mistake or aggressive it is . when everything becomes a matter of self-defense and the proper distinctions between actual legtimate self-defense and reckless failings are erased quite soon most of the rest of the world won t pay any attention to israel claims of self-defense even when they are legitimate . '' <eos>

<s> israeli raid on flotilla was aggressive ; ca n't be called self-defense <eos>
