<s> civil war ? could an early withdrawal avoid causing a civil war ? <eos>

<s> after the coalition withdraws iraqis will be faced with a choice . iraqis do n't want to commit their country to a suicidal fate in a civil war . indeed after a coalition withdrawal iraqis alone could be blamed for engaging in a civil war . they will want to avoid being held responsible for committing their country to a civil war and a slow death as a country . <eos>

@highlight

<s> after a coalition withdrawal iraqis wo n't want to fail their country by waging a civil war . <eos>
