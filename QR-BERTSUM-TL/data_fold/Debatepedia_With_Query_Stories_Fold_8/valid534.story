<s> extend unemployment benefits : would this be helpful ? <eos>

<s> unemployment benefits are a critical backdrop for employed individuals . if their unemployment benefits are low they be feeling that it is important that they hedge against any possible risks of future unemployment by spending less and saving more . this is not stimulating for the economy . if unemployment benefits are increased employed individuals will feeling more confident in their decision to spend money now even if it does so happen that they are laid-off in the future ; the extended unemployment benefits will still keep them secure . therefore ui provides a boosting of confidence to workers in their choices to spend money and help stimulate the economy . <eos>
