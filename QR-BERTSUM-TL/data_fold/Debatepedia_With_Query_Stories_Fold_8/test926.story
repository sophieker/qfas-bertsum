<s> abstinence message : is the abstinence-only message appropriate ? <eos>

<s> increasing rates of teenage stis pregnancy and the shocking rise in abortion is more to do with the oft cited decaying fabric of society 's values in relationships family and life . pop culture is increasingly sexualised . just watch mtv for five minutes - there 's nothing coy about anything children are exposed to from the media . while nobody is suggesting that this is an easy issue perhaps we should address these attitudes rather than bashing the western educational system for answering questions that many teenagers will raise anyway . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sex-ed teaches nothing new in a culture of sex . <eos>
