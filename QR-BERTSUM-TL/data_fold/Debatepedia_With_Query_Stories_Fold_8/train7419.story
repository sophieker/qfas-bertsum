<s> `` progressive '' ? is cap-and-trade more `` progressive '' than dioxide tax ? <eos>

<s> a progressives tax is one that places a heavier burden on the wealthy . while the carbon tax would be `` flat '' some point out that well-off people consumer more electricity and emit more carbon they drive and fly more have bigger ( and sometimes multiple ) houses and buy more products that require electricity to manufacture and use . most carbon tax revenues will therefore come from families of above-average meaning as well as corporations and government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a carbon tax is not really that `` regressive '' last the wealthy consume more energy and would be taxed more : <eos>
