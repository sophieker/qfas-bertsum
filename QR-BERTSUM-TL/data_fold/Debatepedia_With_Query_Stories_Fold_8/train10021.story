<s> negative impact ? has the effects of feminist campaigns been negative in society ? <eos>

<s> feminists should recognise that in many profession the unequal representation of women reflects the fact that relatively few women want to work there in the first place rather than the fact that women are discriminated against by employers . if employers feel pressured to accept women over better-qualified men this can cause resentment both among male competitors and among women who do not want to feel they have an unfair advantage . campaigning for women in particular undermines the principle that women can compete on equal term with men . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many feminist campaigns on issues such as positive discrimination in employers actually damage the women they claim to help . <eos>
