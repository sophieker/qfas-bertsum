<s> innocents : is it wrong to be concerned about executing innocent people ? <eos>

<s> `` thoughts on the death penalty '' . retrieved 1 may 2008 - `` the person convicted of the murder may have actually killed the victim and may even admit having done so but does not agree that the killing was murder . often the only people who know what really happened are the accused and the deceased . it then comes down to the skill of the prosecution and defence lawyers as to whether there will be a conviction for murder or for manslaughter . it is thus highly probable that people are convicted of murder when they should really have only been convicted of manslaughter . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> individuals are executed on murder charges whom deserved manslaughter <eos>
