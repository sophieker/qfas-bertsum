<s> it is absolutely essential to always using a condoms during casual sexual encounters and extramarital affairs . having no foreskin is `` healthy '' in the trivial sense that nothing can going wrong with an absence organ . parents should not assume that their sons will be sexually reckless in a ways that will defy their authority but instead should teach their sons to respect the direction sex and themselves . and failing that to using a condom ! <eos>

@highlight

<s> most male sexual health problems stems from irresponsible porn not circumcision . <eos>
