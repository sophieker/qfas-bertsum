<s> legality : is the blockade legal under international law ? <eos>

<s> after israel 's unilateral disengagement plan from the gaza strip israel no longer occupied gaza with troops . but israel has retained control over gaza 's airspace and coastline and over its own border with the territory . egypt has control of its border with gaza ( except for the tunnels ) . israel and egypt also control the flow of goods in and out . israel controls fuel imports to gaza and also controls the majority of electricity used in gaza ( approximately # % ) which it supplies from the israeli electrical grid . so while israel may not have troops in gaza any more it has too much control over too many areas of life there . it is effectively an occupier and its blockade should be seen in this <eos>

@highlight

<s> israel controls too much of gaza ; it is an occupier . <eos>
