<s> vs. britannica : is wiki good than britannica ? <eos>

<s> shawn doctorow - `` if you need to really navigate the truth via wikipedia you have to dig into those `` history '' and `` discuss '' pages hang off of every entry . that 's where the real action is the tidily organized palimpsest of the nit-picking that lurks beneath any definitions of `` truth . `` ... the britannica tells you what dead white men agreed upon wikipedia tells you what live internet users are fighting over . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia closes discussions on `` truth '' ; britannica closes it <eos>
