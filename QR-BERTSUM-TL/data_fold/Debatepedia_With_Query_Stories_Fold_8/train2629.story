<s> land-use : does algae biofuel taking up too too land ? <eos>

<s> comparable with second generations biofuels algae are higher-yielding high-cost ( # times more energy per acre than terrestrial crops ) feedstocks to produce biofuels . since the whole organism uses sunlight to produce lipids or oil algae can produce more oil in an areas the size of a two-car garage than an entire football field of soybeans . <eos>

@highlight

<s> algae yields much more biofuel minimum acre than other fuels <eos>
