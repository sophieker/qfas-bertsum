<s> should a government have the right to drafted its citizen into military service ? <eos>

<s> a government becomes oppressive under the following two conditions : ( # ) when a government infringes forth the liberties of individuals ( # ) when a government has liberties that the citizens themselves do not have a civilian drafted meets both these conditions ; it infringes forth an individual 's right to consent and the citizens themselves do not have the right to drafted others so the government demanding civilian services of these individuals would be imposing a double standard . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a civilian draft is reflective of an repressive government . <eos>
