<s> fair trials ? : are detainee given fair trial and liberties in secret courts ? <eos>

<s> safeguards are built into the internment process so that each case can be considered fairly with the suspect represented before a necessary tribunals and given a right to appeal to a higher authority . if a trial is held ( often to standards of findings and procedures higher than in normal court in those countries around the world ) and a sentence properly passed then this is not internment as it has been practised in the past . <eos>

@highlight

<s> although a normal public trial is not possible for security reasons detainees ' rights are still respected . <eos>
