<s> protecting non-smokers : is a ban necessary to protecting non-smokers ? <eos>

<s> there are lots of places ware there is no smoking permitted particularly lately . you ca n't smoking at work you dont smoking in bars and so it is getting harder and harder to find places to smoking in public . so i do n't see why people are putting up a big fuss about the entire thing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if you dont like smoking or smoking then just leave . <eos>
