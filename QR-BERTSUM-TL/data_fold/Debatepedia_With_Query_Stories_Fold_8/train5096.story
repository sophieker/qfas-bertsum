<s> efficacy : can carbon capture and storing be effective ? <eos>

<s> a few engineering proposals have been made for the more difficult task of capturing co # directly from the air but work in this area is still in its infancy . globally research technologies demonstrated a pre-prototype in # . [ # ] capture costs are estimated to be higher than from point sources but may be feasible for dealing with emissions from localized sources like automobiles and aircraft . the theoretically required electricity for air capture is only slightly more than for capture from point sources . the extra costs come from the devices that use the natural air flow . remove co # from the surroundings is a form of geoengineering by emissions gas remediation .

<s> ccs can be use to drawing carbon directly from air . <eos>
