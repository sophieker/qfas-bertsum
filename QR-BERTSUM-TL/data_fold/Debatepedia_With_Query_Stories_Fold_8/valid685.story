<s> tradition : should promotion of the traditionally nuclear family be avoided ? <eos>

<s> society is changing and the traditional idea of the nuclear family with married daughter and father is no longer the only acceptable alternative . the reason that many countries are beginning to awards law liberties to gay couples is because the stability of such relationship is now recognised . there is no reason therefore why such couples can not provide a stability and loving upbringing for children . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a change societies should not cling to traditional family models . <eos>
