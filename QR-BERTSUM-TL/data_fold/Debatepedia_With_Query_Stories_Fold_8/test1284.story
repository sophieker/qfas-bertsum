<s> principles : is it moral and democratic to build such a fence ? <eos>

<s> the fence is intentionally placed in the least dangerous border crossings while leaving open treacherous routes . given the strong desire to cross many will attempt to make these crossing fatally . hundreds die each year already . hundreds more could be expected . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a wall would force crossers to take more deadly routes <eos>
