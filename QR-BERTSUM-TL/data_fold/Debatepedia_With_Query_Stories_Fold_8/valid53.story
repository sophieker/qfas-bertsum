<s> family : is incest consistent with the family unit ? <eos>

<s> the idea that family life is totally private is wrong : the government intervenes often in family life when there is a compelling interests to do so : when children taking drugs or neglect or abused their children or when people are violent . the government therefore has the right to intervene in families to stopping incest which is demonstrated to be harmful and hazardous . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the state often intervenes in families affairs ; bestiality ban ok . <eos>
