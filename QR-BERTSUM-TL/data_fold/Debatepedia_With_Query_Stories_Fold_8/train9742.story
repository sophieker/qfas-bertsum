<s> electric grids : is wind energy consistent with electricity grids ? <eos>

<s> electricity grids are typically designed to have a hand full of very large generators contributing massive quantities of energy to the grid from very few locations . wind energy runs contrary to this model with many windfarms theoretically contributing small quantities of electricity to the grid from widespread locations . this runs contrary to the original model of grid design and grids may have a difficult time dealing with it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> electric grids are not designed for many disparate wind farms . <eos>
