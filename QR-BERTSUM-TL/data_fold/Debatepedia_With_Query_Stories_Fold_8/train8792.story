<s> religious philosophy : are religious philosophies generally detrimental or beneficial in society ? <eos>

<s> even if one assumes the foundational theology premises of religions are false compete religious beliefs about proper personal and society behavior acts as a society `` genetic code '' . societies and sub-societies in the past prospered in a virtual forms of natural selection based on the amount of wisdom encoded in their religious doctrine . examples of `` unclean '' food and practices which predate scientific knowledge of germs suggest similar society wisdom may be encoded in religious proscriptions . until and unless we fully developing a rigorous empirical science of society behavior and evolve non-religious disciplines and institutions to serve this role we should not lightly dismiss religion based society wisdom . <eos>

@highlight

<s> religious dogma provide a repository for social compassion <eos>
