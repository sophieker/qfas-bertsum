<s> feasibility : is the ban on downloading feasible ? does it matter ? <eos>

<s> even if we could not track down each and every individual who downloads music and films that does not mean that the ban is pointless . even if we can not enforce the ban perfectly it does not make sense not to try it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nothing is perfect but we should give it a try . <eos>
