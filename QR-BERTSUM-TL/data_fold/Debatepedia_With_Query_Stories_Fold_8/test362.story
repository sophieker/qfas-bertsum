<s> the flag was waving and rippling : does this prove the moon landing was a hoax ? <eos>

<s> the flag was rippling because when the astronaut put the flag in he might have pushed it a bit and because of the law of action and reaction ( 3rd newton 's law ) and law of inertia ( 1st newton 's law ) it continued to ripple . <eos>

@highlight

<s> newton 's laws apply here . <eos>
