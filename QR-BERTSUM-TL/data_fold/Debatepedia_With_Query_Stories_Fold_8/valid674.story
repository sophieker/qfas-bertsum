<s> costs : is allow gays in the military economical ? <eos>

<s> argued in the section on talents recruiting and retention there is good evidence that there are many members of the military as well as potential recruit that oppose gays in the military and who may leave the military or avoid enlisting if gays are allowed to serve openly . this would be very expensive in dollar-terms to the military . and while some homosexuals may be lost directly a ban on homosexuals and while this may be expensive it can easily be argued that this is more than outweighed by the costs of losing opponents to gays in the military . <eos>

<s> homosexuals in the military would be expensive in recruiting/retention . <eos>
