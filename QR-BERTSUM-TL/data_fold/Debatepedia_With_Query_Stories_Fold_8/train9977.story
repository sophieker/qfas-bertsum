<s> pain : is it acceptable that circumcision is excruciating for infants ? <eos>

<s> anesthetics can not be administered to infants caused to the risks . this means that infants are subjecting to a level of pain beyond what children are allowed to tolerated ; children undergoing circumcision are given anesthetics . it is wrong to inflict infants to this level of pain . <eos>

@highlight

<s> circumcision erroneously inflicts chronic pain on infants <eos>
