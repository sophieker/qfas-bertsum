<s> reducing emissions : can market approaches better reducing emission ? <eos>

<s> with cafe standards in the united states for example substantial fines were established for car manufacturers that produced inefficient cars . in # cars had to be able to travel # . # miles per gallon ( mpg ) and light trucks had to be able to drive # . # . companies were fines $ # for each # . # mileage over fleet-limit for each car sold . so if a company purchased # million cars that averaged # . # mileage over the standard it would be fines $ # million . [ # ] actually this created a good cost-based incentive for car-manufacturers to producing more efficient cars that emit fewer carbon gases . so standards set cost and create incentive for change just like so-called `` market-mechanisms '' . <eos>

<s> top-down regulations do create costs that incentivize reductions in dioxide emissions : <eos>
