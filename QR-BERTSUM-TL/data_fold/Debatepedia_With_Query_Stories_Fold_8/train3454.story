<s> learning : does it lead to improving teaching in its broadest sense ? <eos>

<s> because no children left behind makes passing tests such a central priorities teachers do n't have much of an incentive to spend time helping those that are already likely to pass nor those that are highly unlikely to pass ( it would be wasting energy ) . the best bang-for-the-buck for teachers under threat from k- # penalties is to focus on students that are just below the passing grade . this is unfortunate because every children should be same equal attention to grow regardless of their abilities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nclb gets teacher to overemphasis on those just below passing <eos>
