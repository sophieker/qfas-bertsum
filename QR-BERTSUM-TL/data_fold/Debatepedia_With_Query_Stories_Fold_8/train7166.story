<s> sustainability : is reactors energy sustainable long-term ? is it `` renewable '' ? <eos>

<s> nuclear powers plants are only # % thermally efficient . this means for every kilowatt of electricity produced almost once as much waste heating is generated . nuclear plants require significant quantities of waters to remove the waste heating - normally into the environment . such demands on waters resources are impractical harm agriculture and general raise waters utility prices . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear energy require substantial waters to cool the reactor <eos>
