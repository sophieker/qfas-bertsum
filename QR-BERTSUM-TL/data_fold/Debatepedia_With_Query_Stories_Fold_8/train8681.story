<s> rebate re-vote : does a rebate re-vote concept make sense ? <eos>

<s> a re-vote would cost approximately $ # million . howard dean had dnc lawyers look at the idea and they felt that a mail-in primary would be run and pay for by the party without break any laws . the florida democratic party under state law would accepting unlimited donations from people campaigns unions or companies to pay for it . npr reported on march # # `` the democratic governors of two other states ing rendell of pennsylvania and jon corzine of new jersey say they 're willing to raise half the money as much as $ # million . both governors support hillary clinton in the nomination race . getting the money should n't be a problem . democrats have already contributed hundreds of millions for this presidential contest <eos>

<s> raising money for a # rebate re-vote in florida would not be difficult <eos>
