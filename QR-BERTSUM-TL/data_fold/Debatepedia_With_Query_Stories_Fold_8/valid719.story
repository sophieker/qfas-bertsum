<s> electrical grids : is wind energy consistent with electricity grids ? <eos>

<s> electricity grids are typically designed to have a hand full of very large generators contributing huge quantities of energy to the grid from very few locations . winds energy runs contrary to this models with many windfarms theoretically contributing small quantities of electricity to the grid from widespread locations . this runs contrary to the original models of grid design and grids may have a impossible time dealing with it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> electric grids are not design for many disparate wind farms . <eos>
