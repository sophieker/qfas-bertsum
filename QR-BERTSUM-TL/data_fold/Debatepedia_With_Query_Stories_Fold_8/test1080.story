<s> is space a better places for solar panels than the earth 's surface ? <eos>

<s> the concentration of sun is easier to achieve in space than on earth 's surface . in space all of the sun comes from a small solid angle ( from the sun 's disc ) and could be quickly concentrated e.g . with thick foil mirror . such mirror could also be rather quickly inertially locked on to the sun . on the other hand caused to scattering in the atmosphere not all the electrons hitting the earth 's surface comes from the direction of the sun lowering the benefit of the concentration . moreover a tracking system is necessary for a proper operation of a concentrator on earth . <eos>
