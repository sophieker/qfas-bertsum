<s> war on terror : is it mistake to think the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> if us troops leaving there will no longer be a foreign target for terrorists in iraq and from the region . certainly they may try to attack the united state and other eastern countries through various means but his would be more difficult than fighting us forces in iraq . withdraw from iraq would deprive terrorists of as those opportunities to strike as they presently enjoy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iraq is only a artifact threats because us troops are there to be targeted . <eos>
