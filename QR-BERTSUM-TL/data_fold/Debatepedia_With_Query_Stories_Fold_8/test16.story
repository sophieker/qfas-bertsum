<s> law war ? could an late withdrawal avoid causing a law war ? <eos>

<s> the obvious fact why coalition soldiers are effectiveness in holding iraqi factions apart is that they are not iraqi shiites iraqi shias nor iraqi kurds . this means that coalition soldiers can act effectively ad unbiased arbiters security forces policemen and check point officers . and iraqis can trust coalition soldiers as unbiased in these role which is absolutely essential . if coalition forces were not trusted as arbiters in a sectarian conflicts they would would not be approaches by iraqis with important information on crime or sectarian violence . <eos>

@highlight

<s> coalition forces are neutral and so more capable than iraqi troops of prevent civil war <eos>
