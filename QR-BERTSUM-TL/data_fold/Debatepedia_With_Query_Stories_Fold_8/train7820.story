<s> learning : does it lead to improved teaching in its broadest sense ? <eos>

<s> the focus on standardized testing ( all students in a state take the same tests under the same conditions ) as the means of assessment encourages teachers to taught a narrower subset of skills that will increase tests performance rather than focus on deeper understanding and life lesson that can be applied in the marketplace real life and to citizenship and democracy generally . because teachers and schools may be punished if they fail to live up to standardized tests score goals they often have a perverse incentive to focus almost entirely on teaching to the tests especially where a school is at risk of being designated as `` failing '' . <eos>

<s> no child right out motivates unfortunate `` teaching to the test '' : <eos>
