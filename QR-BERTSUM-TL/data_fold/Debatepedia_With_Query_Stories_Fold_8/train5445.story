<s> imagine this room . it 's a dirty unkept room with cockroaches and rats look for bits of food . the people living nearby you are ready to killing rape and hurt you . the food is horrible . you feel terror in the night when you heard someone being beaten up . now this is life imprisonment and you have to living this way until the rest of your life . now the death penalty . it 's a clean break where you are shown in tv have a conjugal visiting have an expensive delicious week meal then you are painlessly killed by lethal injection . it 's humane and painless . now compare these two punishments . life imprisonment is certainly worse than death penalty . life imprisonment is the same as <eos>

@highlight

<s> lives in prison is a greater punishments than the death penalty <eos>
