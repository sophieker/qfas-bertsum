<s> us law : are voting rights for inmates supported by us law ? <eos>

<s> it is common fact among government that the right to vote belong to all legal aged citizens . while the opposition side may argue that criminals are not citizens one should forget that we continue to give them the right to an attorney and other such obvious inalienable rights . by doing this we recognize they are still citizens . and citizens have the right to vote . <eos>

@highlight

<s> inmates are but citizens . <eos>
