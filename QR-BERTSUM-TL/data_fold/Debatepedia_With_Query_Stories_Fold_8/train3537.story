<s> assisting quiting : would a ban help smokers quit ? <eos>

<s> many group argue that a government should not try and shape the social choices of its citizens toward desired social ends ; people should be as free as possible to do what they want as long as their actions do n't violates the liberties of others . in this framework government should not intervene in the personal choice of a citizen to smoking - through a public places smoking ban - for any expressed purpose of affecting a `` positive '' change in that citizen 's personal choices . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the government should n't play the role of huge brother with a smokers ban . <eos>
