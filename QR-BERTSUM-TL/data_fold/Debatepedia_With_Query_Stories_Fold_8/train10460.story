<s> law avenues : would it help avoid illegal means of gender selection ? <eos>

<s> in many countries and cultures gender selection happens already usually by selective abortions or abandonment of unwanted babies . everyone can agree that this is a horrible waste of life and potential very dangerous for the mother concerned and of courses many people object strongly to abortions on moral grounds . the use of new technologies to allowing gender selection at the start of pregnant will reduce and hoping eventually end the use of selective abortion . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gender selection is been occurring by less appropriate means . <eos>
