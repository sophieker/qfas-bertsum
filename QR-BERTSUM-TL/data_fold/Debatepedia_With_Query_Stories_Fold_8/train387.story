<s> health care : which candidate 's health care plan is superior ? <eos>

<s> clinton 's universal health care plan is indeed more comprehensive than obama 's . but that 's the problem . by covering # million uninsured instead of # million clinton 's health care plan is set to be extremely expensive ; roughly twice as expensive as obama 's plan . this is not possible with current us budgets and deficits . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hillary 's universal health care plan is too expensive . <eos>
