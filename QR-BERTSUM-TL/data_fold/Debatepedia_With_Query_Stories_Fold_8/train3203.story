<s> commercial : is surrogacy likely to be commercialized ? is this exploitative ? <eos>

<s> even if commercialization does occur it would be control by strict law and regulate by independent body as is currently the case in the us . if standard charges were fixed there would simply be no rooms for a market to develop thus ensuring that all had access to a surrogate if they wanted . <eos>

@highlight

<s> surrogacy need not involve cash payments of any kind . <eos>
