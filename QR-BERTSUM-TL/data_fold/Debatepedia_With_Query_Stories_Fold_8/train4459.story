<s> romany schools : would autonomy allow the roma to create a good romany educational system ? <eos>

<s> education is the key to lifting the romany community out of poverty and welfare dependency . according to the charity save the children a third of europe s gypsies never attend school . # per cent of greek roma can not read and write . traditional romany parents reject assimilation and the children that do enter the school system are or shunted off into schools for the backward or defeated by bullies and the difficulties of being forced to compete in a foreign gadje language . specialist romany schools like gandhi college in the hungarian town of pecs have already proved successful . nation status and the access to eu funded that accompany this would help the extension of these existing schemes across europe without overburdening <eos>

@highlight

<s> nationhood would enable the strengthening of rome schools which have proved very important to the education of romanys : <eos>
