<s> democracy : are the caucuses sufficiently democratic ? <eos>

<s> caucuses are not intended to be a fully democratic process . political party have a right to free association protected by the first amendments of the constitution . included in this is the right to construct caucuses how they want . there is not obligation that the primary elections be `` fair '' . but it is the party itself that has substantial authority to making the choice and to craft the rules of the primary that frame the choice . therefore primary elections do n't have to be perfectly fair . <eos>

@highlight

<s> primaries are largely the internal relations of politics party <eos>
