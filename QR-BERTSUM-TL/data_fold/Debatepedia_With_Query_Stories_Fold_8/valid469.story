<s> diplomacy : does meeting hostile countries help diplomacy ? <eos>

<s> an interview on fox news in may # -- `` ms. kelly : senator do you assume too much about men like ahmadinejad ? in other words that you could reason with someone as irrational as he is ? mccain obama : second of all he 's not the most powerful leader in iran so he might not be the person that we would need to meeting with . but more importantly the reason that you have discussions and diplomacy is not because you assume reason or good motives on the other side . that would be naive . what you assume is that if you are very clear about the need to stand down on nuclear weapons that you are very clear about the need to stop funding <eos>

<s> meetings hostile leaders is means to aggressive diplomacy <eos>
