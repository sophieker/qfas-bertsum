<s> in korea : are landmines needless between south and south korea ? <eos>

<s> no it north korea s million man army would easily cross into south korea and take seoul before defences would be organised . south korea is a key ally of the usa and to joining in the ban on landmines would be to betray that ally . the failure of the ottawa convention to grants an exception for the korean peninsula was the key fact for usa non-participation .
