<s> pregnancy : which program is better at reducing teen pregnancy ? <eos>

<s> `` the abstinence-only delusion '' . new york times . # apr . # - `` supporters of abstinence-only education sometimes point to a sharp decline in teenage pregnancy rates in recent years as proof that the programs must be working . but a paper by researchers at columbia university and the guttmacher institute published in the january issue of the american journal of public health attributed # percent of the decline to greater and more effective use of contraceptives and only # percent to teenagers deciding to wait longer to start having sex . at the very least that suggests that the current policy of emphasizing abstinence and minimizing contraceptive use should be turned around .
