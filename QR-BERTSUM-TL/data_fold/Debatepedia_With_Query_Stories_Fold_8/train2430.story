<s> consumption : would legalization decrease drug-consumption ? <eos>

<s> if a consumer can go to their local drug store around the corner to obtain drugs with greater ease they are more likely to do so . obtaining drugs illegally is much more difficult albeit far too easy . finding a drug dealer arranging a time to meet in a secure area and running all the various risks of dealing illegally are inconveniences that will be removed by legalization with the likely result of increased consumption . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the legalization of drugs will increase consumption <eos>
