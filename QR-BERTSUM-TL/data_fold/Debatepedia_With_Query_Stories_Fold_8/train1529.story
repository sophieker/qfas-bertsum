<s> feasibility : is a mission to mars less technologically feasible ? <eos>

<s> the apollo missions packed as much food as possible to keep the astronauts alive and it ended up that even freeze-dried food is heavy . it costs about $ # # per pounds to sending thing into space ( non-living ) which would also be amazing food costs for just one mission . <eos>

@highlight

<s> weight of supply for long mars trip is impractical . <eos>
