<s> justice : is immunity from prosecution for politicians consistent with the need to uphold justice ? <eos>

<s> many complaints against public figures are grave . they may well be related to the nature of the way in which that person fulfils his public office . for example the action may be about holding someone to account or encouraging a fuller public insight into something in which the government has been involved . in many cases these may be things which it is important to have publicized and for the relevant people to be held accountable in the interests of good and also open government . giving politicians power without accompanying responsibility and accountability will actively encourage abuse of power because the person will know that he is effectively unaccountable for his actions at law .

@highlight

<s> crimes may relate to the office itself and it is important to prosecute crimes for the purpose of upholding accountability : <eos>
