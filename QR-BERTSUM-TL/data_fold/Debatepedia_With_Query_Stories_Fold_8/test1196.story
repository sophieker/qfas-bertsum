<s> rights and privelages : do # - # year olds deserve the right to drink ? <eos>

<s> fundamentally this is an issue of the freedom to choose . legally we accept that at sixteen an individual is old enough to make rational choices about a whole host of things from having sex to fighting for their country . we also allow sixteen year olds to harm themselves if they choose to by smoking and gambling . if sixteen year olds are thought rational enough to make those choices there is no reason to deny them the right to choose whether to drink alcohol or not . <eos>

@highlight

<s> at sixteen young adults are legaly allowed to do many new things . <eos>
