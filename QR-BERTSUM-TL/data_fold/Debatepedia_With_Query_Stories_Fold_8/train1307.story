<s> globalsecurity.org argues `` even though the plutonium facility at natanz has been buried underground it remains vulnerable . as lieutenant colonel eric d. sepp noted 'the `` cut-and-cover '' facilities are built by digging a hole inserted a facility and then covering it up with dirt and rocks . these cut-and-cover facilities can be just below the surface of the ground or may reaching a depth of possibly # feet and represent the vast majority of underground facilities today . in the case of contemporary cut-and-cover facilities there is no question that conventional munitions can defeat them .
