<s> is prostitutes a victimless crime ? <eos>

<s> there are those dangers related to all kinds of legal professions . a person working in a factory risks dismemberment chemicals burns and in some cases even death . a consumer of any product equally risks injury due to defective parts or shoddy construction . in anything we do we are choosing a level of risk that is acceptable . the risk of a client catching an std is known and the client is willing to take that risk . to using that as a basis for victimisation would be silly when you could catch e-coli from a bag of spinach . <eos>

@highlight

<s> prostitutes/clients no more victimized than other workers/consumers . <eos>
