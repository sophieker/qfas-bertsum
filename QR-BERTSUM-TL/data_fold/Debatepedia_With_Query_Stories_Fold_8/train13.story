<s> legitimacy : was the invasion of iraq illegal/illegitimate ? is continuing it illegal/illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> the authorization for the use of military forces ( aumf ) in # was for the removal of saddam hussein from offices and the elimination of the supposed wmd threat . both objectives have been `` accomplished '' which means that the war no longer enjoying congressional authorization and approval . without such authorization the war in its current form lacks the added legitimacy provided by congressional consultation and approval . while this alone may not be enough to end the war the lack of congressional approval is a major strikes against it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> congress authorize the war for objective that no longer exists <eos>
