<s> 1982 war : were britain 's actions in the 1982 war illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> 6. if britain returned the islands it would be a profound insult to the soldiers who fought and died to liberate them in 1982. the campaign was honourably fought in defence of the rights of the people of the falkland islands to determine their own future . it was fought against a military dictatorship which used the campaign in a cynical attempt to divert domestic attention away from its oppressive corrupt and incompetent rule . one of the positive consequences of british victory was that the military junta fell from power and argentina became democratic . so britain argentina and the falkland islanders all have cause to celebrate the outcome of the 1982-83 war . <eos>
