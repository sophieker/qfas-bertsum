<s> accountability : does nclb make teacher and schools more accountable ? <eos>

<s> critics of the nclb requirement for `` one high challenging standard '' claim that some students are simply unable to perform at the level for their age no matter how good the teacher is . edaccountability.org while statewide standards reduce the educational inequality between privileged and underprivileged districts in a states they still impose a `` one size fits all '' standard on individual students . particularly in states with high standards schools can be punished for not being able to drastically raise the achievement of a student who has below-average capabilities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> teachers are not necessarily to blame for poor student performance . <eos>
