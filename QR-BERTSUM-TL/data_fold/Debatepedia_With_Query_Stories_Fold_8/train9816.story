<s> risks : are there major risks/unintended repercussions with geoengineering ? <eos>

<s> ken caldeira of the carnegie institution for science knows we should test the technology gradually comparing it to a knob on a device : `` you can turn it gently or violently . the more gently it gets turned the less disruptive the changes will be . environmentally the least risky thing to do is to slowly scale up small fields experiments . but ideologically that s the riskier thing to do . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> geoengineering can be slowly tests and implemented . <eos>
