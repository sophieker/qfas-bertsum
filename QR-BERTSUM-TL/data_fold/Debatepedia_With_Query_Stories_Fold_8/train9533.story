<s> war on terror : is it wrong to think the war in iraq protect the homeland ? <eos>

<s> if us troops leave there will no longer be a foreign target for terrorists in iraq and from the region . certainly they may try to attack the united state and other western countries through various means but his would be more difficult than fighting us forces in iraq . withdrawing from iraq would deprive terrorists of as many opportunities to strike as they presently enjoy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iraq is only a jihadist-terrorist threat because we soldiers are there to be targeted . <eos>
