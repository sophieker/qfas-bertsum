<s> warming change : can nuclear energy help reducing emission fight warming change ? <eos>

<s> fossil fuel are not inherently required in mining uranium and buildings nuclear plants . it just so happens that all modern machinery and vehicle involvement in this process are powered by fossil fuels . yet these fossil-fuel-based machinery can be replaced by electric vehicle and machinery perhaps supplied by nuclear power plants themselves . in sum nuclear energy is inherently clean . it is only the process surrounding it that are dirty . this can and will change . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear electricity has a carbon footprints but it is negligible . <eos>
