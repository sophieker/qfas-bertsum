<s> safety : are caffeinated alcohol drinks unsafe ? <eos>

<s> `` banning alcoholic energy drinks is loco . '' usf oracle . november 8th 2010 : `` many complain that four loko 's 23.5 ounce can is too large to contain 12 percent alcohol and that it 's too dangerous to mix alcohol with ingredients like caffeine and guarana which are the active ingredients in energy drinks . however bottles of liquor can contain more than six times as much alcohol as four loko . wine can easily contain just as much at 12 to 15 percent alcohol . both come in much larger sizes . '' <eos>
