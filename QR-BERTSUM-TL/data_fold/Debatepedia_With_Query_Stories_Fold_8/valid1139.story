<s> products : do advertisements to children foster a `` must-have '' mentality ? <eos>

<s> advertising intended to children is unethical because they have bit or no cash of their own and have to convince their children to buy the products for them . rather than advertising directly to children companies using a `` nag and whine '' campaign that leads to bad feeling between children and children . they rely on pester powers to making adults spend cash they don t have on things they don t want to buy and which their children may well only play with for a few hours . <eos>

@highlight

<s> ads cause children to begging for products ; harms child-parent relations . <eos>
