<s> security : are the burqa/niqab a secure risk ? <eos>

<s> the concern over wearing burqas on public transit seems to surround fears about suicide bombers using them to concealing their identity before detonating a bomb . but suicide bombers have ever needed to or definitely wanted to concealing their identity before committing their act . rather they simply strap on explosives under baggy clothing going to crowded places and blow themselves up without concern about getting caught and punished because clearly they will be dead . so a ban on the burka will do anything to prevent a determined suicide bomber from committing their act . therefore a burka ban does little to help counter terrorism and ensure national security . <eos>

@highlight

<s> suicide bombers do n't care to disguises identity w/ burqas . <eos>
