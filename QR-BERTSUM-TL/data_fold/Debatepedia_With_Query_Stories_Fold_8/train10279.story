'' the miami herald . nov. # # : `` the obligation to stand trial in an open court of law is a defeat for the alleged mastermind of the # / # attacks who once expressed a desire to plead guilty in the military commission system established in guant namo . because the trial venue has been discredited around the islamic world -- and among u.s. allies -- fulfilling his wish would have solidified his status as martyr on behalf of a distorted version of islam . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> military tribunals are a propaganda win for terrorists <eos>
