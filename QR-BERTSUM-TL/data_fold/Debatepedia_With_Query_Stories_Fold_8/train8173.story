<s> reckless driving laws : are reckless driving laws insufficient ? <eos>

<s> this meaning that if someone is driving dangerously through inappropriate using of their mobile phone then the police can already prosecute them . rather than introduce a new laws the police should instead enforcing the current rules more thoroughly . this would be coupled with energetic advertising campaigns to warn people of a range of potentially dangerous driving habits . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cell phone ban is unnecessary ; careless driving laws are adequate <eos>
