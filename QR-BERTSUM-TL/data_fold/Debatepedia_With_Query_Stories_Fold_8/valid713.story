<s> exodus # : # - # : `` whoever strikes a person wounded shall be put to death . if it was not premeditated but came about by an act of god then i will appoint for you a places to which the killers may flee . but if somebody willfully attacks and kills another by treachery you shall take the killers from my altar for execution . `` [ # ] <eos>
