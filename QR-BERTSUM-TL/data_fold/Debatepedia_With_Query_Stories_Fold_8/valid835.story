<s> equality : does nclb improve educational equality ? <eos>

<s> students who are learning english have an automatic three-year-long window to take assessments in their native language after which they must generally demonstrate proficiency on an english language assessment . the local education authority may grant any student another two years ' testing in his native language on a case-by-case basis . in practice however only # states choose to test any students in their native language ( almost entirely spanish speakers ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no child left behind lacks non-english tests . <eos>
