<s> free speech : do hate crime laws conform with principles of free speech ? <eos>

<s> such legislation essentially penalizes the thoughts emotions or motives behind an act . the act itself if illegal would already be worthy of punishment . such policies set a precedent for punishing individuals who hold beliefs the government or the majority of people do not believe . the potential exists for such precedents to later be used against the very minority interests the government seeks to protect in the present . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hate crime laws violate free speech more than hate crimes themselves . <eos>
