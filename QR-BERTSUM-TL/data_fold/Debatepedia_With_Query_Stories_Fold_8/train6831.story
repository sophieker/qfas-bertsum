<s> kangaroos attack people in australia on a statistically regular basis . because kangaroo are probably stronger and more powerful than humans they are both willing to engage in a fight and able to inflict crippling damaging and even death . because over-population increases instances of encounters between kangaroos and humans mainly because habit-depletion can force kangaroo to seek food in urban areas or on farmland over-population can probably increase the risk posed by kangaroos to humans . as such a cull is capable of reduce the risk kangaroos pose to humans . <eos>
