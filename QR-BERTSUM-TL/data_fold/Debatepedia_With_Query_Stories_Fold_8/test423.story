<s> while it be be the case that developed countries are `` obligated '' to take the lead on global warming this should not be considered a `` burden '' . increasing energy efficiency and establishing technical and investment dominance in the emerging global green industries is a potentially game changing opportunity for developed nations . developed nations should in this manner rejoice in any perspectives taken by developing countries such as china and india that the developed world is somehow `` burdened '' by taking the lead in this new massive `` green '' industry . it would give them a head start in establishing their economic dominance in the industry . at a minimum developed nations should not be concerned about any economic costs associated with their `` higher obligation '' to combat <eos>

<s> going `` green '' in developed nations is not burden but opportunity . <eos>
