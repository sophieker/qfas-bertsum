<s> fans : would a college football playoff make fans happy ? <eos>

<s> mark purdy : `` college football playoff sounds great but is a bad idea . '' mercury news . january # th # : `` i attended the rose bowl as a fan . my wife and i had a swell time . we also paid $ # for our two tickets face value . [ ... ] that 's a lot of money . but we enjoyed the day . we hassled with old friends from ohio . we watched . yet as i looked around the stadium at all the fans from ohio state and washington this thought crossed my mind : `` what if this were a college playoff quarterfinal game ? how many of these fans if their team won would then be willing to pay $ # or $ # or $ # more per seat the next week <eos>
