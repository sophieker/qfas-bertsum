<s> recovery : would expiring the bush tax cuts dampens the recovery ? <eos>

<s> revenue coming from lower tax on the rich can be reinvested into the economy to stimulate growth instead of just sitting in the bank accounts of the wealthy . now it is true that some affluent will direct investing this money . but certainly not all do so . taxation and reinvesting that money assures that it re-circulates around the economy . <eos>
