<s> global warming : is wind energy an important part of fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> when the wind is not blowing back-up sources of energy will have to supply the grid . some argue that these back-up sources will be coal and other dirty energy sources . but this need not be the case at all . there is no reason why clean sources - such as solar geothermal tidal and even nuclear - ca n't back-up wind energy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> clean sources can back-up wind energy down-times . <eos>
