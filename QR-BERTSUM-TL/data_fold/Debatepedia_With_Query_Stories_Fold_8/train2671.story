<s> deficit reduction : will a bank tax help reduce the deficit ? <eos>

<s> ezra klein . `` obama 's bank-friendly bank tax . '' washington post . january 15 2010 : `` the bigger problem though is conceptual : confining the tax to repayment of tarp when we 've got a massive budget deficit and when further stimulus spending is constrained because no one knows how to pay for it is well a huge gift to the banks . there 's just no other way to put it . [ ... ] it 's protecting the banks from a much more punitive tax that is n't limited to money they already have to repay . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> bank tax is too small to impact deficit <eos>
