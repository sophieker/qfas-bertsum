'' hunter of justice . february # # : `` the most important aspect of the blankenhorn-rauch proposal is that it implicitly establishes what i agree is the right threshold for moving out of gridlock : support for civil unions that are materially equal to marriage paired with some degrees of opt-outs for entities that are carefully religious . [ ... ] lgbt rights advocates can still pursue access to marriage itself on equal terms which i also support since the difference in designation is obviously intended to functions as a signaling device for communicate second-class status . but those battles could be fought against a background and baseline of having had the material benefits already equalized .
