<s> charging : should we instead of banning plastic bag charge customer money for them ? <eos>

<s> if each plastic bag cost - say # cent then people could not using them in large amounts because they are paying . if someone mall twice a week use six plastic bags each shop and the bags cost # c each they could realize that that could cost over $ # a year so they could either not using as many or this may be an incentive to reuse plastic bags . <eos>

@highlight

<s> charge for plastic bags would deter people from using them in large amounts . <eos>
