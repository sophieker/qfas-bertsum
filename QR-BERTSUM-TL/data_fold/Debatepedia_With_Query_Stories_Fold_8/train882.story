<s> universal laws : can regional laws break `` universal '' laws justifying civil disobedience ? <eos>

<s> the widely-held idea of the social contract teaches that by living under a states we accept the benefit it gives us ( for example protection health care education etc . ) and by accepting these benefit we consent to its laws . if individuals placed their own values whatever they are based upon over the collective laws of the states the states could dissolve and none of its benefit could be offered to any of us .

@highlight

<s> order requires that law are obeying but if they are `` wrong '' . <eos>
