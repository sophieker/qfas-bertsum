<s> change : is assassinate a dictator a good means to affecting change ? <eos>

<s> alternatives such as constructive engagement or economy sanctions are preferable and much more likely to result in inevitable liberalisation of the regime albeit slowly . the example of eastern europe in # and yugoslavia in # show that even in apparently hopeless cases change can come through popular actions often quickly and without great violence . cambodia in # iraq in # and afghanistan in # all saw dictatorships quickly overthrown by external forces . <eos>

<s> to liberalize a regime there are good way than assassination . <eos>
