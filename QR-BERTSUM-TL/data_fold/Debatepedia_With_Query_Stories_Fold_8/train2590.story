<s> afghans security forces : are more troops need to train/foster afghans security forces ? <eos>

<s> bruce riedel and michael o'hanlon . `` why we ca n't go small in afghanistan '' . usa today . september # # : `` afghan forces simply do not have the capacity to do the protecting themselves at this point and given the challenges of building up newest institutions in afghanistan after decade of war will not have the ability until at least # . even that distant dates will be postponed further if we do not deploy enough forces to mentor and partner with afghans as they build up an army and police force partly from scratch . this adds up to a prescription for a drying up of intelligence .
