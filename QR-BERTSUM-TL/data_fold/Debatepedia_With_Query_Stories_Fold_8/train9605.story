<s> should officers be more lenient when issuing parking fines ? <eos>

<s> the council does n't care about how long you park for especially if you just park for a few minutes too long they just want to make money ( revenue ) from you . this is not fair because they are just profiting from your accidental `` illegal '' parking . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is just revenue raising . <eos>
