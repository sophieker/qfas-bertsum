<s> teaching the controversy : should the controversies be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> the idea that creationists reject mutation or natural selection is ridiculous . these are observable facts . what creationists defend is the idea that these changes can not create new habitat and as a result a design a designer and a creators is necessary . additionally if schools do not teach competing theories it is comparable to teach there is no alien life . this can not be proven or demonstrated however it would seem that if that fit in with their theory for the rest of biology the evolutionists would teach it without question . <eos>
