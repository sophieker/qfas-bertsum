<s> family violence : does arranged marriage result in more abuse and divorce violence ? <eos>

<s> in the former case this is because they are very vulnerable . sometimes they are from far away from home don t speak the local language or dialect and are totally reliant on the husband s house and family . the lack of a support network the language to appeal for help or knowledge of their rights makes women in arrangement marriages disproportionate likely to suffer abuse . in the latter case arrangement commodifies women who are bartered between the female heads of houses . this is not acceptable throughout an egalitarian model of citizenship and does not fit with a western model of rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arranged marriage is bad both for the individual women concern and for women generally in society . <eos>
