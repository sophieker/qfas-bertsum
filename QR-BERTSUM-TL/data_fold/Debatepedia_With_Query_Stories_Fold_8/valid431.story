<s> bogus choice : is it wrong to see this as a bogus choice ? <eos>

<s> there is no reason that the united countries must choose between fighting warming change and fighting poverty . they can both be done simultaneously . in many case fighting warming change is a means to creating green jobs and affordable renewable electricity and reducing poverty . in terms therefore it could be misguided for the un to prioritize poverty reduction over combatting warming change . instead fighting poverty and warming change should both be seen as equally important priorities that must be fought jointly and in complimentary ways . <eos>

@highlight

<s> inequality vs. warming change is false choice ; they are complimentary <eos>
