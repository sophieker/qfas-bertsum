<s> should ex-felon 's have the right to vote ? <eos>

<s> this is because the poor and african americans tend to vote democratic . it is no surprise that most of the felon disenfranchisement laws were sponsored by republicans . in fact in # alabama republican party chairman marty connors told the washington post : `` as frank as i can be we 're opposed to [ restoring voting rights ] because felons do n't tend to vote republican . '' a study by uggen and manza found that if felons had been allowed to vote in florida in # al gore would have won the vote in this state. # <eos>

@highlight

<s> depriving ex-felons of the right to vote gives an unfair advantage to the republican party <eos>
