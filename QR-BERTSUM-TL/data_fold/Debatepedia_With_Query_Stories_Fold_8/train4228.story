<s> government : is a fat tax justified in shaping society ends ? <eos>

<s> arguments about `` cost to society '' are premised on the virtue of `` society '' being forced to paying for individual `` bad '' choices . sharing risk should be voluntary and not blackmailed by the state because only the individual can assign values to the risk or reward of their choices . `` cost to society '' arguments are moot in the absence of blackmailed society welfare . <eos>

@highlight

<s> fat tax society engineer distances individuals from consequences . <eos>
