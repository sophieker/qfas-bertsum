'' canada free press . january 8 2010 : `` the cbc warned that the scanners emit radiation . well if ways have been found protect x-ray technicians and others who work with radiation then the screeners can be protected . and there was nothing to suggest that flyers who get scanned are at risk although when the machines are put into use that will inevitably come up .
