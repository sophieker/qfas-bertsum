<s> rights : is the libertarian perspective on individual rights appropriate ? <eos>

<s> when people are given the choice of what they want to do they are likely to choose the one that is best for themselves and society . because this is true it is in the collective interest of society to trust in the choices of individuals . because society is better off with full individuals choice we should extend to individuals full autonomy in their decision-making . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those choose best for themselves ; they should have a right to this choice . <eos>
