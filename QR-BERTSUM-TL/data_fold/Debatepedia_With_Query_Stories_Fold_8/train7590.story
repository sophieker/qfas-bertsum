<s> societal arguments -- would society benefit in general from a ban on partial birth abortions ? <eos>

<s> the arguments here is that the provision given to a woman should be as flexible as possible affording her the `` right '' to make transformative choices throughout the entire course of her pregnancy and not locking her into an unwanted pregnancy after a certain point as would be the case with a partial birth abortion ban . on an issue where good transformative impact can occurs from singular mistakes and particularly when these mistakes are frequently made during an immature emotional period in a woman 's life it may be important for society to providing women with the benefits of the doubt and the flexibility to make major decisions throughout their pregnancy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> part of the mistakes that a girl or woman might have made is not having used sex protection and/or not <eos>
