<s> general humaneness : is veal farming generally humane or cruel ? <eos>

<s> that the treatment of baby cows is cruel in some farms does not mean that such treatment will persist . regulations can be passed to end such cruel and undignified treatments . but to ban veal farming all together would be to overcompensate for current regulation failures . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if humane practices are not being followed than regulations can be improved . <eos>
