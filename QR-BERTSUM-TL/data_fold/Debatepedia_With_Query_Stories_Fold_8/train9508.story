<s> # nd bomb : was it necessary to drop the third bomb on nagasaki ? <eos>

<s> even if hiroshima was necessary the u.s. should have waited for word on the devastation of hiroshima to filter out to the people and leadership of japan . if they had waited and playing more diplomatic cards in the interim it would have been possible to persuade japan to surrender . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the us should have waited long before bombing nagasaki . <eos>
