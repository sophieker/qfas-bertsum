<s> dc non-state : is a ban appropriate to 2nd amendment in light of dc not being a state ? <eos>

<s> some argue that washington dc is not a state and so the constitutional right to bear arms does not necessarily apply . yet dc residents are united states citizens even if they are not citizens of states . the constitution and the second amendment apply to them as much as to other citizens . the right to bear arms is a right conferred to all us citizens equally including dc residents . if we assume that the constitution provides an individual right to bear arms then we should assume that us citizens residing in dc receive the same privilege to exercise this right as do other citizens . <eos>
