<s> competition : is the competition introducing by vouchers a good thing ? <eos>

<s> nobel prizes won economist keynes friedman argued for the modern concept of vouchers in the # s stating that competition would improve schools and cost efficiency . they introduce competition by giving parents and students the choice to leave bad schools in favor of better schools . this compares to the far less competitive status quo situation in which students are locked into schools in their district . the argument goes that competition forces schools to act more resourcefully creatively and effectively as a means of enhancing their competitiveness relative to other schools . if they do not do this they will be less competitive lose attendance and tuition lose high-quality students and teachers and possibly be forcing to close . in long vouchers introduce competition <eos>
