<s> medicinal drugs : if the athlete needs medicinal medication should this be an exception ? <eos>

<s> if athletes need medication that usually means that they 're sick or have an injury . usually if an athlete is sick they really should n't be competing in the first place . needing medicine is no excuse for using drugs - if an athlete is sick they should not be deemed fit to play sport . <eos>
