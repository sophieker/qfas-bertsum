<s> human rights : is health care a human right ? <eos>

<s> health is fundamental to the preservation of all other individual rights . if one is sick in a hospital bed they can not be said to have equal opportunity or the ability to exercise free speech and religion . and of course one can not pursue happiness if they are in a hospital bed . this is why health must be considered a basic human right . <eos>

@highlight

<s> health care is a basic human right or entitlement <eos>
