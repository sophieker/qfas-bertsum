<s> developing countries : does outsource benefit developing countries ? <eos>

<s> offshoring relies on a basic industrial base and the required supporting infrastructure including some sort of education system . this will be present in most develop countries but may be partially or wholly absent in underdeveloped countries . the prospect of profiting from outsourcing contracts will encourage both public and private investment in infrastructure both physical and social . in addition offshoring provides bigger markets than would ever be possibility globally for an underdeveloped country which allows it to benefit from economies of scale and capital inflow to develop more rapidly . and over time the demanding of companies for accountable non-arbitrary governments will encourage the rule of law and democracy as will rising education levels and a growing middle class . <eos>
