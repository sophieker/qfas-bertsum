<s> mail-in re-vote : does a mail-in re-vote concept make sense ? <eos>

<s> a mail-in system depends on ballots being received by voters . another of the problems although is that poor voters are frequently transient or no permanent or up-to-date addresses . this means that poor voters are uniquely disadvantaged and disenfranchised by a mail-in ballot system . a walk-in caucus or primary conversely does not depend on voters having permanent address and is subsequently more accessible to poor voters . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a rebate ballot risks disenfranchising poor more transient voter <eos>
