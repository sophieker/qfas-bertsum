<s> demographics : could a guest worker programs be a good demographic measure ? <eos>

<s> senator james cornyn ( r-tx ) in a # senate hear on guest worker legislation - `` we should provide incentives for risk seekers to return to their home country with the capital and the skills they have acquired as temporary workers in the united states if we are going to begin to address the root causes of illegal immigration in the first place . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> incentivizing illegals to leave after the program could help solve the illegal immigrants problem and demographic problems too : <eos>
