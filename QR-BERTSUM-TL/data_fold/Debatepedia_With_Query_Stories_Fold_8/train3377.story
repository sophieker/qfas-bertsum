<s> attention : does criminalization help muffles holocaust deniers ? <eos>

<s> in # historian deborah excretion confronted holocaust denier and pseudo-historian david irving in one of the most famous trials in recent british history . irving had sued dr. excretion for libel after she properly labeled him as a holocaust denier . irving was later imprisoned for his views but excretion called for his release arguing `` generally i do n't think holocaust denial should be a crime . [ ... ] i do n't find these laws efficacious . i think they turn holocaust denial into forbidden fruit and make it more attractive to those who want to toy with the system or challenge the system . '' [ # ] <eos>

<s> criminalizing genocide denying makes it more appealing <eos>
