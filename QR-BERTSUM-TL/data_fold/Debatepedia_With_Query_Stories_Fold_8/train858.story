<s> democracy process : do earmark strengthening the democracy process ? <eos>

<s> earmarks often have nothing to do with the actual substance of a piece of legislation relating to anything else entirely . this creates many problems . the most importance problem is that vote on a piece of legislation may have nothing to do with whether a member of congress support a particular earmark discovered within . this means that earmarks may passes that have virtually no support of congressman and their constituents virtually attaching the earmarks from the democratic process itself . <eos>

@highlight

<s> earmarks are sometimes unrelated to legislation ; undemocratic . <eos>
