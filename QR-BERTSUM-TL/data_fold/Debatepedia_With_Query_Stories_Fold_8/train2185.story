<s> making us safer ? : is internment actually making us safer ? is it a good counter-terrorism strategy ? <eos>

<s> not only is intelligence often badly flawed internment simply does n't work as a strategy to combat terrorism . instead it is counter-productive because it makes martyrs of the individuals and groups who are being detained . the experience of northern ireland was that internment acted as a `` recruiting sergeant '' for the ira radicalising many detainees without previous terrorist contacts and rallying supporters to their cause in response to the perceived injustice . similar responses can be seen to guantanamo bay today in the muslim world . moreover the confidence of ordinary citizens in their governments is undermined by such harsh measures reducing their support for the overall `` war effort '' . indeed if we compromise aspects of our free and open societies in response to pressure <eos>

<s> internet is used effectively by terrorists in propaganda and as a `` recruiting sergeant '' : <eos>
