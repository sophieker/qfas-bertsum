<s> dignity of life : does abortion uphold the `` dignity of life '' ? <eos>

<s> how can you compare an unborn baby to the willing beings that fight in wars they have choosen the fate of going to war and the know of the harsh consquenses that may follow . a baby on the other hand is born into the world if permitted not of their own free will but of the mother 's decision to abort or have the child . <eos>

@highlight

<s> killing helpless fetus is incomparable to death of willing soldier . <eos>
