<s> cellulosic : is cellulosic ethanol promising ? <eos>

<s> david schneider . `` loser : grassoline 's dark side . '' ieee spectrum . january # : `` the benefits to wildlife and the carbon storage [ of planting switchgrass are ] valid if your baseline is traditional farming . but as searchinger and his colleagues pointed out in their # science article truly excess cropland eventually reverts to forest . and when that happens you d get all the wildlife-friendly carbon-storing benefits that ensue . if you plant switchgrass there instead those benefits are lost . 'you have to look at what you give up ' says searchinger . as for growing switchgrass along highways or under power lines that s all good but it would put just a small dent in the problem . '' <eos>

<s> let forests grow on unused farmland not cellulosic ethanol <eos>
