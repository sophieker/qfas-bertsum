<s> practicality : is official english practical ? <eos>

<s> there should be no official national language . one of the great strengths of the united states is that we can experiment on a state-by-state basis . when one state does things one way and a neighboring state does things the other way it is much easy to see the advantages of doing things one way or the other . this allows each state to choose one way or the other based on objective evidence and results . and surely # states have been opting to have english as their state 's official language . while some may disagree on this side with the decision of any one state to adopting official english the state-by-state approach may still be regarded superior to a national english policy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> languages policies should be state-level not national . <eos>
