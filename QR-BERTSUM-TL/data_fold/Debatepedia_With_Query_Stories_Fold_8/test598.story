<s> economics : could a playoff be as economical ? <eos>

<s> mark purdy : `` college football playoff sounds great but is a bad idea . '' mercury news . january # th # : `` the real deciders here when it comes to the bcs 's potential are the university presidents . they 're the ones who have to balance the budgets at their schools . and they have noticed how the current system work well . [ ... ] a whole bunch of bread comes their way every year including the money from the infidel and lower-echelon bowls . those presidents are very risk-averse . they know that a playoff system would damage the bcs bowls and kill those other bowls entirely . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> bcs makes much more cash than playoffs could <eos>
