<s> religion : is corporal punishment justifiable under religious doctrine ? <eos>

<s> `` the devil can cite scripture for his purpose . '' [ shakespeare ] the bible frequently condones practices that are outrageous to the modern sensibility . it sometimes promotes what would appear to be retribution or wanton acts of violence while at other times it promotes a more jesus-like philosophy of complete non-violence and compassion . so while there are passage in the bible that give support to corporal punishment there are also ones that clearly condemn it . for this reason little value should be assigned to individual passages in the bible as they relate to corporal punishment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> scripture can be cited to enforce or debunk corporal punishment . <eos>
