<s> consumption : could legalizing decrease drug-consumption ? <eos>

<s> `` how to stop the drugs wars . '' the economist . mar # th # : `` fear [ of legalisation ] is basis in large part on the presumption that more people would take drugs under a legal regime . that presumption may be wrong . there is no correlation between the harshness of drugs laws and the incidence of drug-taking : citizens living under tough regimes ( notably america but also britain ) take more drugs not fewer . ashamed drugs warriors blame this on alleged cultural differences but even in fairly similar countries tough rule make little difference to the number of addicts : harsh sweden and more liberal norway have precisely the same addiction rates . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> drug prohibition does not correlate with decreased using <eos>
