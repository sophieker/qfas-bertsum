<s> democracy : is seating the delegates necessary in preserving democracy ? <eos>

<s> the democracy party with the right to free associations has the right to establish rule and to enforce those rules . if michigan and florida break those rule the dnc has the right to punish them . if that right to set and enforce its own rule is limited then the dnc 's free right to associations is infringed forth which harms the democracy principle of the rule of law . <eos>
