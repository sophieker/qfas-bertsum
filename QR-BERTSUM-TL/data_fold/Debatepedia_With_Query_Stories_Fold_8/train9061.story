<s> bill byrne . `` no child left behind really ? why i like this law . '' - `` the fact is that in many many public schools kids with disabilities are not learning to read and do math while the vast majority of them can master these skills with proper instruction . [ ... ] no child left behind will short-circuit all of the excuses and explanations . school systems that do a good job with children with disabilities will show their progress and those that fail to do a good job will have their ineffectiveness exposed . then parents and voters can make informed decisions about how to get the underachievers on track .
