<s> family violence : does arrangement marriage result in more abuse and marital violence ? <eos>

<s> the institution of marriage always creates interdependence and therefore scope for abuse and danger and the cops and outsider always find it more difficult to intervene where violence is within a marriage . this is a criticisms of marriage per se and not arrangement and we can t ban marriage . the vulnerability of those without language skills is an accepted fact of immigration policy again it applies to all immigration and not to arranged marriages . eventually most marriage organisers are actually women as in the auntie system in india . they gain prestige and authority through their role . this doesn t seem to oppress women . what you are really saying is that islamic society are patriarchal and that muslims have arranged marriages . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arranged marriages in europe and north america have idiosyncratically low level of abuse and marital violence . <eos>
