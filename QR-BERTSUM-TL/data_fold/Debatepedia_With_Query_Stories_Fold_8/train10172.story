<s> rehabilitation : does prisoner voting help in rehabilitation ? <eos>

<s> rehabilitation is the main goal in the prison systems of modern liberal democracies . punishment is seen less and less as the objective of the prison system or at least it is less important than rehabilitation . therefore if offering voting rights to prisoners helps in rehabilitation this benefit outweights any concerns surrounding it `` weakening the punishment of prison '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rehabilitation is main goal ( not punishment ) ; voting helps <eos>
