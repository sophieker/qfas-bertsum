<s> incentives : does immunity from prosecution incentivize politicians to break the law ? <eos>

<s> the media constantly is watching over politicians . these people would be named shamed and humiliated by the media if they were to do something that may have them charged if they were n't immune from prosecution . also politicians want to be re-elected . people wo n't vote for them if they have gained a criminal record and politicians do n't want this to happen and would n't break the law anyway . <eos>

@highlight

<s> politicians are elected as responsible people . <eos>
