<s> status quo : would an amendment simply clarify the reality that japan 's `` defensive '' military forces is no various than an `` offensive '' <eos>

<s> all weaponry is capable of both . japan is in reality heavily armed albeit in the form of a national self defense force ( sdf ) . she maintains land ocean and air force which could seem to be contrary to the constitution but every attempt to deploying them against something other than an attack on japan soil requires endless delay and constitution debate . a constitution revision could bring welcome clarity to the situation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the distinction between defensive and offensive capability is an absurd one : <eos>
