<s> government : is a fat tax justified in shaping social ends ? <eos>

<s> anorexia is a serious problem in many societies particularly among young women . it is often driven by an impression that a society demands or desires slimness among its members . some argue that a government policy that taxes fatty foods for the sake of upholding such an image or ideal ( even if for a multitude of reasons ) could re-enforce the impression among certain members of society that they must be slim and go toward justifying extreme dieting anorexia and/or bulimia toward this end .
