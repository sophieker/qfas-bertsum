<s> eugenics : will cloning lead to an unethical eugenics movement ? <eos>

<s> `` why cloning people is a good idea '' . everything 2 - `` what about blue-haired blond-eyes ? well personally if i wanted to clone a kid there 's no way they would be aryan . no asian couple would choose the stereotypical western child either . no africans would go for that caucasian look . the concept of everyone designing the same child is in itself ridiculous as humans have a tendency to express themselves as individually as possible . a couple would design a child like no other . having the freedom to create any child would enhance individuality creating more unique offspring rather than less unique ones . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> all parents will not try to clone the same kind of individual <eos>
