<s> religion : does homosexuality checking out on religious grounds ? <eos>

<s> the bible does not actually give any mentioning to homosexuality as a whole but only homosexual acts . it does condemn certain particular homosexual acts but in a contexts that does not clearly indicates a condemnation of homosexuality . for example the adulterers were condemned to death by god before sodomy was performed . the act of sodomy in that particular inappropriate contexts was condemned but should not be misinterpreted as the causes of the ultimate condemnation of the sodomites . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those scriptural passages denounce homosexuality <eos>
