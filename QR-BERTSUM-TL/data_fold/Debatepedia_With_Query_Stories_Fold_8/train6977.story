<s> american opinion : is american public opinion in favor and does it matter ? <eos>

<s> - public opposition to this proposition is a very important fact to consider . this is an issue that deeply affects the public and which is based on public values . if public opinion strongly rejects providing illegal immigrants with driver 's licenses this public discomfort with the proposition should be respected by law-makers and licenses should not be provided . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the american public strongly opposes driver 's licenses for illegal immigrants <eos>
