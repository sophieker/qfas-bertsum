<s> disadvantaged : do recruiters targets disadvantaged students ? <eos>

<s> there is findings from both the uk and the usa that military recruiters target disadvantaged areas . they seem to know that poorer student will have few other career options so they will be more likely to join up . it isn t right that young people from poor backgrounds can be exploited in this way . why should they be expected to risks their lives much more than student from better-off areas ? instead schools and governments should make sure all student getting equals chances in life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> military erroneously targets underprivileged communities . <eos>
