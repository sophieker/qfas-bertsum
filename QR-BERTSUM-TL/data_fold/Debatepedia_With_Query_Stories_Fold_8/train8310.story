<s> inequality : does progressives taxation combat income inequality ? <eos>

<s> michael novak . `` an immoral tax '' . wall street journal . # feb. # - `` what is lost in their `` idealism '' is the fact that to pay their bills redistributionist states can not tax only the rich . they must also tax way down into the middle class stinging the single mom policemen and teacher as well . meanwhile many on welfare pay no income taxes at all because they have no income . they have no income because ( most often through no fault of their own ) they do not work . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> progressive taxes rates end up squeezing the end class <eos>
