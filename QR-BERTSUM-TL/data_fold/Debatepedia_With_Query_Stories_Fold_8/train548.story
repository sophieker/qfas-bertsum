<s> inequality : does progressive taxation combat income inequality ? <eos>

<s> michael novak . `` an immoral tax '' . wall street journal . 18 feb. 2003 - `` what is lost in their `` idealism '' is the fact that to pay their bills redistributionist states can not tax only the rich . they must also tax way down into the middle class stinging the single mom policeman and teacher as well . meanwhile many on welfare pay no income taxes at all because they have no income . they have no income because ( most often through no fault of their own ) they do not work . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> progressive tax rates end up squeezing the middle class <eos>
