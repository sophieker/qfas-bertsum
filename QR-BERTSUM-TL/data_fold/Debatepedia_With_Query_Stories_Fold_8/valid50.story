<s> un efficacy : can the un effectively compel annex i states to increase aid ? <eos>

<s> jim giles . `` comment : climate aid is tantamount to bribery . '' new scientist . january 13 2009 : `` ilyana kuziemko and eric werker economists at princeton and harvard universities respectively have shown that countries receive almost 60 % more aid from the us when they hold one of the 10 two-year seats on the un security council . [ ... ] this is bribery and it works . alex dreher of g ttingen university and colleagues looked at the voting record of 143 countries at the un general assembly : those that received us aid were more likely to follow the voting patterns of their donor . it suits the us and others to buy influence in this way but the approach does not necessarily lead to effective aid programmes .
