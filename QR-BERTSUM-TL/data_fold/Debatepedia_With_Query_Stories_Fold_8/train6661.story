<s> problem : are laser pointers presently a problem ? <eos>

<s> laser attacks on aircraft are extremely rare . there have never been repeated laser offenders because all offenders have been charged with an illegal offence and will never attack again . most airport have never reported any laser attacks on landing aircraft and only a few ( particularly sydney airport ) have reported them however they are rare and do not happen regularly . pointing laser at aircraft is the only problems caused by laser pointers and these issues are illegal and uncommon . laser are not a massive problems and do not pose an immediate threat to the safe of people . <eos>
