<s> fetus rights : is it wrong to assign rights to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> ayn rand - `` never mind the vicious nonsense of claiming that an embryo has a 'right to life . ' a piece of protoplasm has no rights - and no life in the human sense of the term . one may argue about the later stages of a pregnancy but the essential issue concerns only the first three months . to equate a potential with an actual is vicious ; to advocate the sacrifice of the latter to the former is unspeakable . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> potential of fetus to become a person is not sufficient <eos>
