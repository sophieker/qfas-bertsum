<s> religious philosophy : are religious philosophies generally harmful or beneficial in society ? <eos>

<s> once we needed gods or deities to explain our world and to give us some hope of purpose . god is a trap for lazy people who find it easier to have someone think for them . science has explained many of the processes of the universe that were once gods . god also provides humanity ( in their vanity ) a special purpose beyond that of other life . our arrogance caused us to believe we are special so we created god and an afterlife . <eos>

@highlight

<s> we no longer need god . <eos>
