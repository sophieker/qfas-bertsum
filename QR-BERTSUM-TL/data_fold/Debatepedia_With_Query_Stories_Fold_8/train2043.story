<s> `` right to die '' ? does every citizens have a `` right to die '' at a time of choice ? <eos>

<s> it is acceptable to take a lives in self-defense . it is acceptable to sending soldiers into war to die and kill to achieve certain ends . it is acceptable to risk human lives in mission into space . and it is regarded acceptable by some ( actually many conservatives that oppose euthanasia ) to execute criminals . clearly lives is not inviolable in modern society . it can be violated or risked for certain highly valuable end ( security justice discovery ) . the question with euthanasia therefore is not whether lives can be violated for certain end ( it can ) . the question is whether it can be a justified trade-off and if so how to ensure that euthanasia is only performed when it is fully justified under the criteria <eos>

@highlight

<s> opponents of euthanasia wrongly argue that human died is always wrong ; exceptions exist . <eos>
