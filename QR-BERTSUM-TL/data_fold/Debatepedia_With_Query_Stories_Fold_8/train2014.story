<s> efficacy : are calorie counts effectiveness at improving health ? <eos>

<s> carl bialik . `` do the numbers behind calories counts add up ? '' . the wall street journal . july # # : rachel johnson a professor of nutrition at the university of vermont who co-authored a skeptical paper about the effect of menu labeling said there is a need for extra research to determine if ultimately providing calories labeling in restaurants will help stop the progression of overweight and obesity among the america public . until this evidence is available i take a do no harm approach to the issue and i do not see that any harm would be done to consumers by providing this important information . <eos>
