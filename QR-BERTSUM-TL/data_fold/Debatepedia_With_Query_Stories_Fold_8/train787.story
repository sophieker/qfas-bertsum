<s> consistency : is tidal electricity generation consistently reliable ? <eos>

<s> tidal electricity varies on a daily terms with the movements of the tide . the tides moves fastest in the morning and night and is much slower in between as it shifts directions . this variability meaning that tidal electricity requires a stand-by source of energy . this is typically considered in unappealing traits in an electricity resource because it requires complex managing and can require the burning of fossil fuels as the stand-by electricity source . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tidal energy production varies with tides ; requires standby power <eos>
