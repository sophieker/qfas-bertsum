<s> blame for conflict : who is to blame as the primary cause of the conflict ? <eos>

<s> by controlling gaza 's borders trade electricity and water israel has remained an `` occupying '' force over gaza . by international law this requires that israel uphold the humanitarian interests of gazans . the blockade clearly violated this obligation and was a major cause of the conflict . <eos>

@highlight

<s> israel failed its responsibilities as an occupier of gaza <eos>
