<s> culture freedom : does arranged marriage breaches the principle of culture freedom ? <eos>

<s> ( and any ethnographic data confirms it not to mention the frequency of arrangement throughout the world . ) as we have pointed out there is no conflict between arrangement and a guarantee of free choice the two are entirely consistent . who is going to stand up and tell ethnic minorities that they don t know if they want arranged marriages and if or not it definitely is part of their culture ? it is just ethnocentrism writ large . furthermore how can we perhaps insisting that immigrants regard our virtues of toleration if that amounts to denying them culture freedom ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> both young and older people affirm the fact that arranged marriages is a cultural tradition . <eos>
