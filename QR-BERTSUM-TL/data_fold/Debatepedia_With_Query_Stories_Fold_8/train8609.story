<s> politicians/others : would this ban apply to everyone that might deciding to put up a political ad or just politicians ? <eos>

<s> it s true that there are implementation issues on this policy . but at least it would have some effect and go some way in making the politics environment more palatable . the internet would surely be a big problem but it s nevertheless still the case that most people getting their impressions of politics candidates from tv and print which we can police . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the bans should apply to everyone : <eos>
