<s> are we currently testing athlete too much ? <eos>

<s> if athlete know when tests will be or the tests are frequent athlete could easily get away with using drugs . andrew johns a former australia nrl player used drugs for twenty years while playing sport . if he was tested once out of the testing routine they would have picked up that he was using drugs . we 're not suggests four times a day or anything but it ca n't be too infrequent . <eos>

<s> if we slack off in test athlete could quickly get away with drug use . <eos>
