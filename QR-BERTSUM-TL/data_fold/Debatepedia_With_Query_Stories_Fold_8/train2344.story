<s> moderately forms of torture - is it appropriate to allow more moderately forms of torture ? <eos>

<s> the wrongful of severe pain or bodily damage is generally considered the definition of torture . but this leaves plenty of legal room for advanced interrogations that inflict serious irritation and pain ( not severe pain ) on the suspect . the law actually allows for a substantial amount of aggressive interrogation techniques . <eos>

<s> advances interrogations are beautifully legal : <eos>
