<s> strategy : is the blockades strategically valuable to israel ? <eos>

<s> jonathan tobin . `` embrace of hamas s goal of breaking the blockade dooms peace efforts . '' commentary magazine . june # th # : `` the problem with these [ anti israeli blockade ] pieces is that if israel did as they wished it would effectively doom any chances for peace with the palestinians . lifting the blockade and allowing the download flow of goods into the area which will open the floodgates for not only food and medicine which are already in plentiful supply in gaza but also for iranian arms and construction materials that will strengthen hamas s fortifications would be the second step toward establishing the sovereignty of the hamas regime in gaza .
