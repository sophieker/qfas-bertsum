<s> quality : do election improving the quality of judges ? <eos>

<s> some have proposed a sort of hybrid system in which judiciary elections exist but in which a pre-screening process ensures that all candidates appropriately qualified to become a judge . this maintains the ability of voter to choose based on their best judgement but which ensures against instance in which wholly unqualified judges are elected to the bench . this along with other possible systems demonstrate that it is needless to entirely rid the system of elections . elections can be maintain while various mechanisms can be worked into place that check against any of the difficulties they may produce . <eos>

<s> screenings can helping ensure judicial candidates have sufficient merit . <eos>
