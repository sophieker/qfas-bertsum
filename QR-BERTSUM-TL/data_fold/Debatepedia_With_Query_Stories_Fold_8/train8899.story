<s> security : are the appointers a secure risk ? <eos>

<s> in # a number of european towns banning the wearing of ski masks and motorcycle helmets in public specifically because they covered the face and so posed a security and crime risk . the same logic applies to the burqa . so the ban on the burka and burqa should be considered part of a broader ban on all face-covering masks in public particularly in and up overcrowded areas and in public transportation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> ban all face-covering masks in public places including burqas . <eos>
