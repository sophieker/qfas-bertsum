<s> ross douthat . `` against instant replay . '' new york times . june 3 2010 : `` to avoid the extraordinary bad calls you have to start overturning the quotidian bad calls the gaffes and brain cramps that have always been part of the warp and woof of the game and that have never detracted a whit from anyone s enjoyment of it . and i m pretty sure that would be a mistake . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> instant replay would force overturning of small calls too <eos>
