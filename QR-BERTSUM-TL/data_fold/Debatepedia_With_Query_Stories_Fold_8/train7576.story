<s> cellulosic : is cellulosic methanol promising ? <eos>

<s> electric cars which get their electricity from renewable sources such as winds or photovoltaic power are the future . they are much more efficient than cellulosic fuel processes convert energy much more directly from winds turbines and photovoltaic panels into the drive-train of the vehicle . grow plants on lands harvest them chopping them up breaking them down with enzymes into ethanol transporting them to gas-stations and then burning them as fuel in the end-use vehicles is a much less efficient process than transporting electrons over wires directly from wind-turbines to homes or electric powering stations for electric cars . and cellulosic ethanol degrades local flight quality with non-c # emissions and entails a variety of other risks ( like deforestation ) that do not surround <eos>

@highlight

<s> electric cars are the potential not fuel-based cars . <eos>
