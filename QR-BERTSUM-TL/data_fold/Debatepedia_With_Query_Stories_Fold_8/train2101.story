<s> global warming : can biofuels help fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> biofuels are less polluting than fossil fuels because co # is absorbed in the process of photosynthesis by the very plants that are being used to produce biofuel . another way to know of this is that in the cycle of this process plants are growing which absorbs c # from the atmosphere to photosynthesis and grow . when these plants are converted into biofuel and then burnt the c # that is released into the atmosphere is equivalent to the c # that was absorbed by the plant in the process of photosynthesis . this means that the amount of c # released is equivalent to the amount absorbed and that biofuels are thus carbon neutral . <eos>

@highlight

<s> carbon neutral biofuel only emits co # they draw from atmosphere <eos>
