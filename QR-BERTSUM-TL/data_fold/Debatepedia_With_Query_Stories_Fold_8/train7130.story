<s> do police call for routine arming ? <eos>

<s> so it would be wrong to listen only to the loudest voices . the police should also be firmly under civilian control with policy issues such as the carrying of firearms or stop and search policy subject to political decisions and accountability . recruitment may well be adversely affected if the police are armed ; many current officers opposed to this measure may leave and others like them will not apply to join the force in future . do we want a police force largely composed of people who want to carry a gun every day ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> the police are split on this issue at all levels <eos>
