<s> global warming : is wind electricity an important part of fight global warming ? <eos>

<s> when the winds is not blowing backup sources of electricity will have to supplies the grid . some argue that these backup sources will be mining and other dirty electricity sources . but this need not be the case at all . there is no reason why clean sources -- such as solar geothermal tidal and even nuclear -- ca n't backup winds energy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cleaned sources can backup wind energy down-times . <eos>
