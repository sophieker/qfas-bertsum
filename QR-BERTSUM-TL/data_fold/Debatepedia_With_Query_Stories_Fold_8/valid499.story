<s> those most likely to take up the opportunities offer by this change in the law live in remote isolated places where abused is even more likely to be successfully concealed . the recent case of repeated sexual abused on the islands of pitcairn demonstrating the dangers of small society determining their own moral agenda . this kind of abused becomes much more likely when the state sanction some of the acts concerned as the argument becomes about lack of consent which is much more difficult to prove than about incest itself . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legalizing bestiality increases the risk of abuse . <eos>
