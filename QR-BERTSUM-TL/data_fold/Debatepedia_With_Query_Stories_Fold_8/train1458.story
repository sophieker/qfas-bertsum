<s> eezs : should a ban extend into exclusively economic areas ? <eos>

<s> a country s exclusive economic zone stretches # nautical miles from the coastline . in fact because of the gradually sloping-away of the sea-bottom from the coast this zone of # miles forms a uniquely habitat for about # % of known fish species meaning that the high sea provide no escape . besides : who is going to check and patrol to see if all those domestic industrial fishers really keep throughout the eez ? the un has no police force to enforce its rules . interestingly enough japan for example banned the use of driftnets inside its territorial waters ( up to a maximum of # miles out of the coast ) but their commercial fleet regularly shows up everywhere in the north pacific . this is <eos>

@highlight

<s> an effective driftnet ban should go far international waters into countries ' exclusive economic zones . <eos>
