<s> global warming : is global warming chiefly man-made making kyoto important ? <eos>

<s> even if beings are not actually the `` chief '' causes of global warming there is little dispute that we play some role due to our emissions of greenhouse gases which contribute to the warming of the globe . as such the kyoto protocol is an important tool in the fighting against human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and global warming . <eos>
