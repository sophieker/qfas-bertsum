<s> justification : is slapping okay if it is justified ? <eos>

<s> all systems of human rights law are qualified . the questions of whether the right concern is engaged at all relies on proving that the acts is illegitimate . further even if the right is engaged if it is justified for one of the many reasons written into the structure of the rights themselves it will amount to a legitimate qualification of the right and therefore will not fall foul of the relevant legislation . finally european human rights law enables a margins of discretion for national laws to take into account cultural differences and the judgment of legislators . we are beautifully entitled to make our own decisions about this issue . <eos>
