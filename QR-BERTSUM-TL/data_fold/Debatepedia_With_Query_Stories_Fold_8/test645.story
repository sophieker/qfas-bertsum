<s> international law : do enhance interrogations comply with i-law ? <eos>

<s> john yoo 's analysis that the us president was not binding by the switzerland conventions and was free to implementing enhanced interrogations even if they flaunted these conventions was based upon work about world war ii by carl schmitt . example of arguments used by schmitt ( according to horton ) : `` particularly on the eastern front the conflicts was a nonconventional sort of warfare being waged against a barbarous enemy which engaged in terrorist practices and which itself did not observe the law of armed conflict . individual combatants who engaged in terrorist practices or who fought in civilian formations engaged in such practices were not entitled to protections under international humanitarian law and the adjudicatory provisions of the switzerland conventions could thus be avoided <eos>

<s> non-state terrorists are not protected under global law . <eos>
