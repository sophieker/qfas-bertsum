<s> japan 's case : is japan exceptional in the ways that it committed atrocities ? <eos>

<s> that has not been the case with other countries that have committing atrocities such as cambodia : if it did perhaps they could have this restriction too . such a restriction not existing elsewhere is hardly an argument for abandoning it where it does exist . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the constitutional restrictions springs from the circumstances that led to the governance of japan being administered by western powers . <eos>
