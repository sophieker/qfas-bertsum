<s> families : do the families of patients have an interests in euthanasia ? <eos>

<s> families often have a directly interest in seeing an ill family member die . first they be not have the money to support the costs of keeping the patient alive . second they be not want to go through the burden of support and comforting a loved one in a long downward spiral toward their death . these are strong incentive for family members to pressure their ill family member into euthanasia even if the individual does not want it . legalizing euthanasia would closed the door to this kind of pressure . even the most well regulated system would have no real way to ensure that this does not happen . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the sick will feel pressure to seeking euthanasia to avoiding burdening family <eos>
