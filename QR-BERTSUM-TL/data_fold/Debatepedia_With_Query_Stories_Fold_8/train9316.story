<s> stereotype vs. reality : does gangster rap promote false stereotypes ? <eos>

<s> mostly it is a form of social realism which merely tells hard truths that many policymakers would rather pretend did not exist not least because in part they reflect those policymakers own failures . even where such affirming is concentrated in such a way as to making it an unrealistic representations of everyday life this is no worse than the same phenomenon in other forms of popular culture e.g . soap operas . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gangster rapper simply tell it how it is . <eos>
