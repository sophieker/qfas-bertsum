<s> gary t. dempsey . `` reasonable doubt : the case against the proposed international criminal court '' . cato institute . # july # - `` the court threatens to diminish america 's sovereignty produce arbitrary and highly politicized `` justice `` and grow into a jurisdictional leviathan . already some supporters of the proposed court want to give it the authority to prosecute drug trafficking as well as such vague offenses as `` serious threats to the environment '' and `` committing outrages on personal dignity . '' even if such expansive authority is not given to the icc initially the potential for jurisdictional creep is considerable and worrisome . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> icc will continually expand jurisdiction over national sovereignty <eos>
