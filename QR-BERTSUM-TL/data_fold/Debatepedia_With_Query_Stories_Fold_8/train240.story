<s> present : does twitter contribute or distract from the present ? <eos>

<s> no twitter makes people think in terms of everyone but who they are with including themselves . it takes away silence and dilutes our ability to `` be present `` both of which are essential for critical thinking to take shape and authentic relationships to form . plus it 's like the volkswagen commercial : `` in life there are drivers and there are passengers . drivers wanted . '' i do n't want to live in a world of following and being followed . <eos>

<s> twitter distracts from deeper interactions in the present . <eos>
