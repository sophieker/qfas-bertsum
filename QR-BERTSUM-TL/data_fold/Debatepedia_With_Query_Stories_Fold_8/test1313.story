<s> economics : is labelling gm foods economically sound ? <eos>

<s> labeling creates a market in which some goods are labeled and them are not . this segregates the market into apparently more wholesome and less wholesome products . this is unfair to the gm foods industry as there is no conclusive findings that their product is inferior in any way and there is plenty of findings that their products are actually superior ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> labeling of genetically modified foods segregates the market . <eos>
