<s> contract : was aig obligated by contract to give bonuses ? <eos>

<s> the aig bonuses contracts were certainly valid when they were signed . but when taxpayers bailed out aig circumstances certainly changed . it was no longer simply a contract between aig and its employees . turned a third party - the taxpayers and their cash - were introduced . and taxpayers should not be held liable for these bonuses contracts . actually this changed the terms of the contracts and they should be renegotiated . <eos>

@highlight

<s> aig bonuses contracts are invalidated by taxpayers bailout <eos>
