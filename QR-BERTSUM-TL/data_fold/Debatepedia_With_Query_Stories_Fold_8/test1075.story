<s> internationalized : could an aviation tax be internationalized ? <eos>

<s> attempts to place a tax on fuel by individual states will fail as airlines can easily obtain fuel more cheaply elsewhere . and if individual countries raise the cost of flying to and from their airports they will lose income from tourists and business travellers to other states . trying to put a global tax in place will also fail - international treaties actually make it illegal to tax aviation fuel ( the # chicago convention reinforced by many bilateral air service agreements ) and there is no international consensus for change .

<s> an international tax on aviation fuel would be impractical and impossible to put into action . <eos>
