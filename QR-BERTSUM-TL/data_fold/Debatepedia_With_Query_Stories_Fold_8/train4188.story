<s> citizen decisions : are citizens good at making policy ? <eos>

<s> voters tend to look after their self-interests rather than the bigger picture of what needs doing . nimbyism ( `` not in my back yard '' thinking ) is an example of this where voters avoid making personal sacrifices in `` their own back yard '' even if the sacrifices are essential to the common good . <eos>

@highlight

<s> voters tend to be self-centered in a direct democracy . <eos>
