<s> tortured detainees : can tortured detainees only be tried in guantanamo ? <eos>

<s> thomas wilner . `` we do n't need guantanamo bay '' . wall street . december # # - `` some worry that we wo n't be able to convict hardened al qaeda criminals because the evidence against them was extracted by torture and ca n't be used in court . if that is a problem it exists only for a limited group . we can avoid the problem in the future by not torturing people . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> that detainees were tortured should not now prevent us trials <eos>
