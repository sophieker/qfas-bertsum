<s> trade does not exists in a vacuum . it needs a wider infrastructure to support it e.g . roads railways ports education to produce capable law servants to administer trading rules etc . without foreign aid developing countries are not able to develop this kind of support and so can not participate effectively in global trade . aid is not always in the forms of money - it may also be given through expert advisers who help countries prepare for the challenges of globalisation . <eos>
