<s> kosovo viability : would an independent kosovo be a viable state ? <eos>

<s> the kosovo region owes serbia a significant amount of money for what the country has invested in kosovo over the years . it is presumable that kosovo would have to compensate serbia for these investments if it were to gain independence but the cost of this indebtedness could be more than kosovo can bear . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an independent kosovo would have to pay impossible debts to serbia <eos>
