<s> non-experts : is it invaluable or worse that non-scientists can edit on wikipedia ? <eos>

<s> ( with the exception of repeat vandals ) with some time on their hands . moreover there are some experts at work here . over time the huge amount of strong work done by hobbyists and poseurs can ( and no doubt will ) be hugely improved upon by experts . this both makes wikipedia a pleasant intellectual community ( or so it seems to some ) and gives us some confidence that the quality of wikipedia articles will in time if not yet be high . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia seems to attract highly intelligent persuasive people <eos>
