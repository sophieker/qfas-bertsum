<s> ecosystems : does wind energy preserve or harm locally ecosystems ? <eos>

<s> due to the high spinning-speed of wind turbines a substantial amount of lubricant is required . this lubricant leaks from the turbine and gear box and often is casting off of the tips of the spinning turbine blades into the surrounding ecosystem . this can kill plant and wildlife and can drain into local water supplies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> leaking lubricating oils from wind powers can damage environment . <eos>
