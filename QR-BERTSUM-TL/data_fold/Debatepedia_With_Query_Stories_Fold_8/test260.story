<s> contract : was aig obligated by contracts to giving bonuses ? <eos>

<s> citigroup signing its bonuses contracts with its executives with the knowledge that citigroup was on very shaky ground in # . it is not as if the companies was healthier in # when it signing the contracts and then all of a abrupt it fell ill in # . therefore it is plausible and possibly possibly that citigroup signing these contracts as a means of providing its top executives shining parachutes as the companies collapsed around them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> aig signing bonus contract as golden parachute ( invalid ) . <eos>
