<s> kosovo viability : would an independant kosovo be a viable state ? <eos>

<s> the ethnic divisions between serbia and serbia are very considerable with serbia being # % ethnic albanian and serbia being majority ethnic serbian . given the ethnic divisions and history between these three groups the previous arrangements is not viable and will continue to render serbia disfunctional . an independant serbia would function more coherently and effectively . <eos>
