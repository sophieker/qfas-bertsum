<s> discrimination : can civil-unions avoid second-class treatment and discrimination ? <eos>

<s> `` civil unions are not enough . six key reasons why . '' lambda legal : `` 3. a civil union has to be explained and does not get the same respect as a marriage '' ] : `` only the word married conveys the universally understood meaning applicable to the lifetime commitment many couples make . marriage has a meaning unmatched by any other word . regardless of whether civil unions and marriage offer the same benefits and obligations on paper when the government relegates same-sex couples to civil unions rather than marriage it forces them to explain the difference at work at school in hospitals and elsewhere . those couples lose the respect and dignity that they deserve for their commitment to be responsible for each other .
