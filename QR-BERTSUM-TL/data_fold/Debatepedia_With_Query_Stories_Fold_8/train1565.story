<s> non-experts : is it valuable or bad that non-scientists can editing on wikipedia ? <eos>

<s> it is a myth that other wikipedia articles are written by experts in the fields of the article . rather articles are written by professional writers and journalists that are non-experts in the fields in which they are writing articles . typically another of these writers is given the task of writing a couple dozen articles on topic in which they have no expert knowledge . <eos>

@highlight

<s> other encyclopedia articles are written simply by professional writers ( not experts ) . <eos>
