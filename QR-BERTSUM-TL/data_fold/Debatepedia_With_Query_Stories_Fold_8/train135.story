<s> american opinion : is american public opinion in favor and does it matter ? <eos>

<s> there is a strong case that the # th amendment of the constitution provides illegal immigrants with equal protection under the law including in regards to the provision of driver 's licenses . such an interpretation should stand above public opinion . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public opinion is irrelevant to legal/constitutional interpretations on providing driver 's licenses to illegal immigrants . <eos>
