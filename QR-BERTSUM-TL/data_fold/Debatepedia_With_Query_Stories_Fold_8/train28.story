<s> freedom of speech : is criminalization of holocaust denial consistent with free speech ? <eos>

<s> in 2000 historian deborah lipstadt confronted holocaust denier and pseudo-historian david irving in one of the most famous trials in recent british history . irving had sued dr. lipstadt for libel after she correctly labeled him as a holocaust denier . irving was later imprisoned for his views yet lipstadt called for his release arguing `` generally i do n't think holocaust denial should be a crime . i am a free speech person i am against censorship . i do n't find these laws efficacious . i think they turn holocaust denial into forbidden fruit and make it more attractive to people who want to toy with the system or challenge the system .
