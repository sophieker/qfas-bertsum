<s> deficit : will balanced budget help solve debt/deficit ? <eos>

<s> senate minority leader mitch mcconnell : the time has come for a balanced budget amendment that forces washington to balance its books . if these debt negotiations have convinced us of anything it s that we can t leave it to politicians in washington to make the difficult decisions that they need to get our fiscal house in order . the balanced budget amendment will do that for them . now is the moment . no more games . no more gimmicks . the constitution must be amended to keep the government in check . we ve tried persuasion . we ve tried negotiations . we re tried elections . nothing has worked .
