<s> families reunification : should a way to families reunification exist ? <eos>

<s> states have leveled as an argument against the migrants workers convention and against other possible international migrants treaties concerns about a robust right of family reunification to all migrants workers present in migrant-receiving countries . this could offer family members a right to migrate into the state in question resulting in large increases in population size . and there is no certainly that the text of the migrants workers convention aims to creating a `` right '' to family reunification . even if it provides flexibility on how a nation attempts to facilitating re-unification it still requires that states reunite families in some way . under this treaty therefore any migrants could sue the state for not allowing their family ( and perhaps extended family ) to immigrate <eos>

@highlight

<s> family reunification right is obstacle to migrant rights treaty . <eos>
