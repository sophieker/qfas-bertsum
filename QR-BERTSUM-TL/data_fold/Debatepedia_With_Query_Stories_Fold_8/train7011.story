'' napa valley register letter to the editor . march # th # : `` bring back president hoover who in the great depression ordered the deportation of all illegal aliens to make jobs available to american citizens that desperately needed work ! bring back president truman who deported more than two million illegals after world war ii to create jobs for returning veterans . bring back president eisenhower who deported # million mexican nationals . it was done so veterans would have a better chance at jobs . if they could deport the illegals back then they could sure do it today .
