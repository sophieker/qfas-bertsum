<s> enforceability : could a global tax be enforceable ? <eos>

<s> this in fact is the way in which tobin proposed that the tax would be able to manage speculative attacks on a particular currency . unenforceable is thus also based on speculation about what the tax will be at a particular point in time . while the large actors and institutions involvement in trading would not object to a # . # % rate they would object to any condition that this rate would be raised at any point in time . and a high tax would be self-defeating as the financial world can easily evade it through complex financial instruments that bet on currency movements without actually buying or selling currency either .

@highlight

<s> while the tax would originally be set at # . # % there is always the possible that the tax would be raising <eos>
