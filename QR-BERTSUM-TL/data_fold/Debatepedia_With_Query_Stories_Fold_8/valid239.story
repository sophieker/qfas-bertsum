<s> stamina - are workers performing less and less physically demands jobs make it possible for them to work for more <eos>

<s> in such cases there are still significant mental demands on employees which older employees be not be able to cope with . such demands are even increasing e.g . in the form of travel in an era of globalisation . slower reaction times and missteps in memory could make older employees dangerous to themselves and others in some areas of employment . <eos>
