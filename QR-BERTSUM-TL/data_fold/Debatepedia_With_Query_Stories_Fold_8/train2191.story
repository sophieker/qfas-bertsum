<s> animals kill ... is animal testing justified on basis that animals harm one-another too ? <eos>

<s> why should animals be free from obligation and responsibilities towards one-another in the animal kingdom while humans might be obligated by `` animal rights '' to certain responsibilities towards them ? why should humans be alienated from the natural ordering of the animal kingdom in this way ? the answer is that we should not be and animal rights should not exist . <eos>

@highlight

<s> animal rights unfairly alienate beings from the natural order . <eos>
