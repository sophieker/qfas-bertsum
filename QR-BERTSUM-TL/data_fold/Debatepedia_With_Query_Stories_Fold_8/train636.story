<s> equal opportunity : is affirmative actions necessary to achieve equal opportunity ? <eos>

<s> economic or educational disadvantages do not necessarily correlate to those of a particular racial/ethnic status . there are many examples of wealthy well educated black youths that have experience every society advantage there is . there are also examples of white youths that have lived in economic and educational squaller . if it is economic and educational disadvantages that are the problems why not focusing in affirmative action on these criteria instead of race and ethnicity . <eos>

@highlight

<s> affirming action wrongly considers races over econ/edu factors <eos>
