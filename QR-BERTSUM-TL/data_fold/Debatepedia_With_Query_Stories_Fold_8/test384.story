<s> sex rates : which approach is generally more effective at reduce teen sex ? <eos>

<s> it 's ridiculous to think that those teenagers who are not thinking about porn and are unlikely to have an early first sexual experience are going to be rendered horny maniacs just because they are taught the unglamourous facts about sex . have you been to a porn ed lesson - it 's hardly the highlights of the sutra sutra . teenagers are sometimes at a time that they are thinking about porn and relationships anyway so for the benefit of those that may not have the sense to protect themselves but will have porn anyway educating about prevention of stis and pregnancy is the smart way of mananging the issue . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unglamorous abstinence-only does not encourage sex . <eos>
