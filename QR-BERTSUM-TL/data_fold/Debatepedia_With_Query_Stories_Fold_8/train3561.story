<s> health : is marijuana innocuous much to be considered a medicine ? <eos>

<s> who can say that marijuana use is `` worth it '' or `` not worth it '' ? many persons strongly believe that marijuana use has a `` mind expanding '' effect that makes the healthcare costs worth it . other disagree . but can the government or anyone conclude for us all that `` it 's not worth it '' ? no . with so much subjectiveness involvement marijuana should not be illegal . <eos>

@highlight

<s> weighing marijuana 's `` mind-expansion '' against its cost is subjective . <eos>
