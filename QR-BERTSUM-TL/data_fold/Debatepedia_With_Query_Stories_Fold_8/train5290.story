<s> deterrence : can nuclear powers maintain deterrence under a nuclear test ban ? <eos>

<s> the most important way to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapon is through nuclear deterrence . that is by convincing non-nuclear states that develop a nuclear weapon program is futile in the faces of substantial nuclear powers . thus in so far as a nuclear test ban will diminish the arsenals of nuclear powers it will will diminish the power of nuclear deterrent to limit nuclear proliferation . <eos>

<s> reactors deterrent not tests ban is best for non-proliferation <eos>
