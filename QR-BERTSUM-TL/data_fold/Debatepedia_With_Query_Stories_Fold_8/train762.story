<s> `` sport '' : is hunting a fair sport or something else ? <eos>

<s> all animals have their strengths . a elk has advantages over the human such as its speed agility and their superior senses . beings have the advantage of being able to creatively create tools to serve their purpose such as firearms and camouflaged clothing to hunt . because of this animals and hunters are at an equal footing when it comes to hunting . <eos>

<s> hunt is certainly fair because all animals have their strengths . <eos>
