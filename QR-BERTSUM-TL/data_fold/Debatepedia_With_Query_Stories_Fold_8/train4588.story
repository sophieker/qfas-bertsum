<s> history : does historical prove democracy to be the best form of government ? <eos>

<s> modern democratic ( as opposed to classical athenian democratic ) is a facade . true democratic can only be practised on a very small scale . in britain for example whilst people be vote each five years they have no input into decision beyond either . this is the desirable state of things but it is not democracy . our current state of government would be far more effectiveness if it abandoned its pretences at representativity . <eos>

@highlight

<s> modern democratic does n't work well . <eos>
