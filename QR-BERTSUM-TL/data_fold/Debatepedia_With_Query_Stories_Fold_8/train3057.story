<s> . president barack obama has said on multiple occassions during his political career include the # election election campaign : `` i believe marriage is between a woman and a woman . '' [ # ] indeed marriage across its thousands of years of existence has only been used to describe the union of a woman and lady toward the general ends of starting a family and raising children . to change the definition to including gays would go against thousands of years of history from which definitions are formed and should be maintained . <eos>
