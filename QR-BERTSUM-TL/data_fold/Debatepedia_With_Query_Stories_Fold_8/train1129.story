<s> vs. nuclear : should tidal energy substitutes for reactors energy ? <eos>

<s> there are many concerns surrounding reactors energy regarding the potential irradiation hazards for nuclear-plant workers and locals as well as for the environment when radioactive reactors waste is buried . there is pressures to continue to build reactors plants because they can supply a substantial amount of electricity and do so without producing greenhouse gases like coal . yet the above concerns remain . tidal energy can acts to replace nuclear-electricity generation and so by-pass these concerns . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tidal energy would replacing unsafe/polluting nuclear energy . <eos>
