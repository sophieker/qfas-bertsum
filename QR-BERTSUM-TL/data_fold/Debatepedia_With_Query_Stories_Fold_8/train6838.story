<s> individual vs. collective : does the # nd confer an individual or a collective right to arms ? <eos>

<s> the # nd clause of the # nd amendment which relates to the `` right of the people to keep and bear arms '' ( for individual purposes such as self defense ) is more important than the second clause which emphasizes the militia-benefits of a right to bear arms . this interpretation is born out by a historical interpretation of the demanding of this past era in which many individuals owned guns that were not eligible for service in the militia and yet who owned guns and need to using them for various purposes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the second clause of the # nd amendment is wider than the first <eos>
