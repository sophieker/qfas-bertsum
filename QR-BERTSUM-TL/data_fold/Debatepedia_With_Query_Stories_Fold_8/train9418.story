<s> china/india : should china and india be held to lower emissions standards ? <eos>

<s> japan has complained about the dramatic local effects of china 's pollution on japans forests and people . exempting china would condemn japan to even greater consequences from chinese pollution . in a world in which the consequences of a single state 's pollution affect its neighbors and the entire world exemptions are irresponsible and unfair . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china 's emissions harm neighbors/world ; exemptions are unfair . <eos>
