<s> value of debate : does allow debate legitimize holocaust denial ? <eos>

<s> this is not the case : there are no reasonably grounds for believing that the holocaust did not happen . if reputable historians debate with holocaust deniers it implies that the claiming of holocaust deniers have sufficient merit to be considered on the same levels as interpretations based forth a fair reading of historical evidence . thus saying as many do `` all ideas should be open for consideration and debate including holocaust denial '' is an unjustifiable position ; it give undue credit and consideration to a desriminatory discredited and culturally threatening viewpoint . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arguing genocide implies there are two reasonably viewpoints . <eos>
