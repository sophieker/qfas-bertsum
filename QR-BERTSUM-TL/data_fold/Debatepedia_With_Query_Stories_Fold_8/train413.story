<s> should cage fighting ( or mma ) be banned for it being too violent ? <eos>

<s> `` cage fighting is anything more than a human cockfight . it pits two human beings with no subsequent argument into a caged in arena where they attempting as hard as they can to cause as too pain as possibility to the other man . there is no room for such a barbaric sport in today 's society . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> mix martial arts promotes an entertainment comparable to the gladiator fights in the roman colosseum <eos>
