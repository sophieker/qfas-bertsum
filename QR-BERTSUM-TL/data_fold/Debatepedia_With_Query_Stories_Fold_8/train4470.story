<s> economics : how will the arizona illegal immigrant law impact the economy ? <eos>

<s> [ # ] `` the wide array of statistics available from government and private sector sources leads to this conclusion : unemployment disproportionately hits unskilled uneducated blacks and native-born hispanics . why ? it is simple business economics : ( # ) in the unskilled labor market legal workers offer no greater productivity than comparable illegal ones ; ( # ) legal hiring requires employers to conform to u.s. law ; and ( # ) citizen new hires often expect benefits . in short more illegal workers cost employers less . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> arizona law will return jobs back to the american people . <eos>
