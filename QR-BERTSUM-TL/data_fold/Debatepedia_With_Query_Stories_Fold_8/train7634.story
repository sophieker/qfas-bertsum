<s> needy : is free health care important for those in dire need ? <eos>

<s> the modus operandi of the insurance industry is that the vulnerable ( people of higher risk of becoming ill ) pay more for health insurance . but this is unfair and contrary to the higher moral principles upon which societies should be founded . society should strive to defend and care for the needy and vulnerable instead of subjecting them to a system that punishes them for their disadvantages . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is wrong to make more vulnerable people pay more for insurance <eos>
