<s> moral : is abolishing reactors weapons a necessary morality act ? <eos>

<s> over the past fifty years we have seen a general tends towards limited battlefield and precision weapon allowing military objectives to be achieving with minimal loss of civilian life . the whole point of nuclear weapon however is their massive indiscriminate destructive power . their use could kill tens of thousands of civilians directly and their catastrophic environmental after-effects would harms many more all around the world . these effects could never be morally acceptable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear weapons unethically threaten mass murder . <eos>
