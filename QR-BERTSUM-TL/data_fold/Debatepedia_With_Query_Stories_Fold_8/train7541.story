<s> barbarous procedure : is partial-birth abortion a barbarous procedure ? <eos>

<s> the primary alternative to partial birth abortion is the dismemberment and removal in parts ( legs arms head torso ) of an unborn fetus while inside the mother 's womb . this may be more `` gruesome '' than a partial birth abortion . a ban on partial birth abortion would not eliminate this primary alternative to partial birth abortion . neither would it necessarily reduce the number of overall late term abortions being performed . this only goes toward pointing out that a partial birth abortion ban in isolation would not necessarily reduce the `` gruesomeness '' of the late term abortion procedures being performed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a ban on partial birth abortions would stop other even more `` gruesome '' forms of late term abortions . <eos>
