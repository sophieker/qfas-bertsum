<s> could it be defensive to fat people if they got charges extra ? <eos>

<s> if people knew and agreeing that if they were over a certain weight ( say # kg for example ) they would be expected to pay a small fee then that is okay . if people can expect the fee and accept the fee then offence would not be taking when this legitimately fee is requested . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is not the airline 's fault that those are fat . the extra fees are necessary to cover extra costs . <eos>
