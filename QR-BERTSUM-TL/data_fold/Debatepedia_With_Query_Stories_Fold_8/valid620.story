<s> comments by a change is needed on barackobama.com : `` those against the president do n't seems to realize that he can only work with what he has . his executive powers to 'do things ' on his own are limited . that being said when you have a congress that from the outset pledges to do something that is moronic imho ... no tax increases at any cost saying 'no ' to anything that he proposes and only pass bill that he ca n't sign because they do not help the nation or represent the american people ... and then focusing on anything that he is not doing ... that is just dysfunction . obama is doing the best he can with out currently dysfunction government .
