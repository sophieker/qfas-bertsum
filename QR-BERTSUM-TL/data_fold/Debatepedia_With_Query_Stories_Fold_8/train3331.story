<s> rights : which system better protect individuals rights and counters discrimination ? <eos>

<s> pluralism does not simply allowing women 's rights or human rights mistreatment to occur . problems of inequality occur in many ethnic community including muslims and christians and even atheists . while this may be the obligation of wearing a veil in one religion it may be the inability to become a priest in another religion or even unequal pay in the workforce a place where religion has not really a factor . <eos>

@highlight

<s> concerns over women 's rights can not be blamed on pluralism <eos>
