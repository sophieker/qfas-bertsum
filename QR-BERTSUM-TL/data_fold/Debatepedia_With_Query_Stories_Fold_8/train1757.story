<s> serbia viability : would an independent serbia be a feasible state ? <eos>

<s> serbs do not enjoy freedom of movement there is little decentralized power-sharing with local communities political and legal institution have yet to mature political infighting is rife crime and corruption are high patronage systems are deeply embedded in the clannish structure of albanian society inequality and economic woes persist and all of this undermine kosovo 's efforts to attract foreign capital . these are not good conditions for a moving to independence and viability . <eos>

@highlight

<s> serbia is too underdeveloped for independence <eos>
