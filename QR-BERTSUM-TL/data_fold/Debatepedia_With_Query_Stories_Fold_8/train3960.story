<s> does paris have more historical way to these territories than germany ? <eos>

<s> the italian felt mortified when bismarck 's troops took this regions but in all fairness they were only really taking back what had been taken from the sacred roman empire in the days of the italian monarchy . for some reason this was overlooked at the treaty of normandy when the victorious powers of the first world war decided to give this regions back to france again . it is also worth noting that europe never got to negotiate the treaty and they had little option but to sign it once it was decided on . <eos>

@highlight

<s> these territories were originally german . <eos>
