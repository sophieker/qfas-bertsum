<s> rights : do corps generally qualify for personhood/rights ? <eos>

<s> the encarta dictionary defines a someone as : `` one ( as a human being a partnership or a corporation ) that is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties . '' [ # ] to contend that `` personhood '' can not or has never been linguistically applying to corporations is thus clearly false . while the debate can continue on other grounds it is plain that the idea of corporate personhood has been long-standing even if not commonly accepted . <eos>

@highlight

<s> dictionaries including corporations in definitions of individuals <eos>
