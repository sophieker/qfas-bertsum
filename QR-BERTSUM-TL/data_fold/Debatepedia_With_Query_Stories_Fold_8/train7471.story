<s> science : is a new moon landing better for scientific research ? <eos>

<s> in the scope of research and the gathering of information humans have only barely begun to actually study the moon from a scientific perspective . if you are going to do some sort of research or study the moon is obviously the more logical thing to do is study the moon because it is much closer and would allow for the easiest safest and quickest method of transport of human beings as well as scientific data and evidence because of it 's proximity to the earth . many things on planet earth are influenced by the moon and having us physically studied it so little it only seems proper and logical to deal with the moon first and mars later . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is much more to be discovered on/about the moon <eos>
