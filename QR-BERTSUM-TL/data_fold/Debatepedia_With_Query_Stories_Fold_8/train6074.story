<s> `` encyclopedia '' : is wiki an `` encyclopedia '' or is this too strong a word ? <eos>

<s> john willinsky reported a preferences for online sources over print sources - `` only four out of the # entries relied exclusively on print sources ( and they were single source entries ) while print sources turned up in a dozen entries in total ... online sources were obviously favored amongst contributors as the greater interconnectivity which the internet represents compared to print culture which forms part of wikipedia 's quality as an instrument of knowledge and learning . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> wiki is online and interactive unlike other encyclopedias <eos>
