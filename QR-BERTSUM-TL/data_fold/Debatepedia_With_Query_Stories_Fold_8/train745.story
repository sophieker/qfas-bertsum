<s> adult health : is a circumcised penis healthier in adulthood ? <eos>

<s> the vast majority of continental european men who are not moslems are intact . if being intact leads to worse health outcomes comparing data from europe and america would reveal that . i know of no such comparison except one : the circumcised usa has the highest frequency of hiv positive individuals in the oecd . <eos>

@highlight

<s> uncircumcised europeans do not experience significant health problems . <eos>
