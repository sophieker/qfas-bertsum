<s> value : are mercenaries valuable in # st century conflicts ? <eos>

<s> mercenaries are not bound by the same rules and standards of conduct as conventional troops . when problems arise it is often unclear whether army representatives or pmcs should be held responsible leaving a black hole of accountability . moreover the lack of regulation means that there is no means to ensure mercenaries breaking laws are disciplined . currently most mercenaries can operate outside martial law with relative freedom .

<s> mercenaries are more likely to act lawlessly and without accountability : <eos>
