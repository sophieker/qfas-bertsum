<s> tradition : is it wrong to maintaining the tradition of catholic priest celibacy ? <eos>

<s> r.n . lentejas jr. `` debate : priest should be prohibited to marry '' . helium : `` i believe that priest in the latino church should live a celibate life to maintaining the rich tradition of the church . it has been a universally notion from time immemorial until today and until the future that priest are celibates for the sake of the kingdom of god . this is a universally understanding from across the globe unique to catholic priest alone because there are priest in other catholic churches who are actually married . there exists among them ( catholic priests ) a universally concept of brotherhood surpassing the those barriers of race culture ethnic origins economic standing and those others .
