<s> bad zookeepers : are inappropriate zookeepers a good fact to ban zoos ? <eos>

<s> there have in the past been many worse zoos and cruel zookeepers . it is imperative that these are reformed and mulched out . good zoos in which animals are well fed and well looked after in spacious surroundings are becoming the norm and should be encouraged . zoos can exist no cruelty to animals however and so the fact that there are animals entitlements problems with some zoos does not supposed that all zoos should be shut down . <eos>

@highlight

<s> bad zookeeping can be regulated and mulched out . <eos>
