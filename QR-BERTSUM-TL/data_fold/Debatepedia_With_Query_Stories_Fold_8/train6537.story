<s> risks : are the risks of a manned mission to mars tolerable ? <eos>

<s> jazz shaw . `` robots should going where woman hesitates . '' pajamas media . july # # : `` when the mars polar lander entered the martian atmosphere in # it immediately dropped silent and was ever heard from again . it is now claimed that it crashed into the wall of a canyon smashing on the rocks far below . it was a terrible loss in terms of technology and discovery disappointing many but imagine our reaction if that had been a landing craft with five astronauts on board . some risks are but best left to our machine surrogates . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> risks of mission to nov are better assumed by robots <eos>
