<s> alternatives : are the alternative to the caucuses inadequate ? <eos>

<s> by allowing than populated states to start to vote and having the most populated to go last the alternative promotes better democratic participation as the winner of the parties nomination can not be yet established until all states have voted . the states that are last to vote but maintain their influence by the high number of delegates they can offer . this insures that the public retains interest and participates more to the democratic process <eos>

@highlight

<s> backloading of the primary schedule can help reduce the special interest effect contain in all big money campaigns . <eos>
