<s> rights : do women not have a way to wear the burqa/niqab ? <eos>

<s> baron bodissey . `` a yes to a burka bans is a yes to secularization . '' europe news . may # th # : `` the most important question here should be : what does it matter whether it is in the koran or is considered to be prescribed by muslim law ? religious freedom does not mean having to tolerate things that are so inhuman or anti-democratic just because they were required # years ago by the founder of a religion and his ideological disciples and are still seen by orthodox muslims as exemplary ( sunna ) . in a secular european state universal human rights are the terms of our mindset and our laws . blind obey to muslim rules is not appropriate . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` god 's law '' on burka can not override secular human liberties <eos>
