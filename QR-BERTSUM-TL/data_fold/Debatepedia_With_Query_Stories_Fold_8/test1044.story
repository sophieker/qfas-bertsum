<s> unions/advocacy : does unlimited spending favor unions and advocacy groups too ? <eos>

<s> while it is true that the citizens united vs the federal election commission does free non-profits and unions to spend freely just as it does for corporations the difference of course is that corporations ( particularly the titans like big-oil companies exxon mobil and the big financial firms like goldman sachs ) have far far more money . unions and advocacy groups are already maxing out on the spending front so freeing them up wo n't result in much if any of an increase in their spending . major corporations however will be able to increase their spending dramatically as a result of this ruling . it is not fair to say therefore that the ruling benefits both groups . it clearly favors corporations . <eos>

@highlight

<s> citizens united frees unions too but corps are richer <eos>
