<s> quality : do parents provide an enhanced high-quality of education ? <eos>

<s> the same applies to private tutors . furthermore but if a parent or tutor excels in one area will they cover all the things a school does ? the point of the curriculum is that these are things we have decided as a societies that children need to learn . but if strong in one or two fields it seems tremendously unlikely that home schooling can cover all the required ground.these support groups can t make a parent into a teachers any more than a book on engineering makes one an engineer - the vocation of teaching is a much more challenging one than the proposition suggests . <eos>

@highlight

<s> parents are less likely to be good teachers as professionals . <eos>
