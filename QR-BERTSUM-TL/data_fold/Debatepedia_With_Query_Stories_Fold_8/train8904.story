<s> iran : could withdrawal benefit the united states ' ability to deal with iran ? <eos>

<s> it is important to note that iraq shiite are arabic while iranian shiite are persian . this places significant limitations on iran 's capacity to exert influence over the southern region of iraq and generally should reduce concerns that a us withdrawal from iraq will result in iran take control over iraq or at than the shiite south . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iranian influence in iraq is restricted because iraqi shiites are arab not persian . <eos>
