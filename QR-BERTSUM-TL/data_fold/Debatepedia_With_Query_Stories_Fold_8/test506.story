<s> charging flight travelers : would a tax on fuel be good than directly charging flight travellers themselves ? <eos>

<s> an international tax on ticket sales could raising a great deal of money for the developing world ( see point # above ) while still limiting the increase in flights . this has the advantages of being within international law ( unlike taxing aircraft fuel which would requiring every country to agree to changing the chicago convention ) . it could also easily be begun by a group of countries e.g . the eu and extended as other countries came to seeing the benefits of the idea . eu countries such as england and finland already have such a charge for take off and landing at their airports ( although this is not applied to development aid funding ) so there is evidence that it would not distort the aircraft <eos>

@highlight

<s> an alternative way of taxing aviation could be to place a charges upon aeroplane tickets . <eos>
