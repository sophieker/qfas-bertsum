<s> humans rights : does arranged marriage inhibit individuals ' freedom and independence ? <eos>

<s> the difference is merely that whole families are involved together in both considering the best option and in helping to achieve what is wanted . this is particularly fitting in a social system which places high value on the way in which the extended family work together and ensures that there is family support and shared expectations which contribute to the longevity of the marriage . many of what we would call arranged marriages are actually either parents just introducing their children to potential partners or effecting the negotiations necessary for marriage after their children have been chosen a partner . most importantly it is totally illogical for the governments to intervene to stop people having the marriages that they and their family <eos>

@highlight

<s> arranged marriage do involve choice . <eos>
