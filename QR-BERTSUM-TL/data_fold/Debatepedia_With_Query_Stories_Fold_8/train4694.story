<s> consumption levels : will legalization reduce the consumption of marijuana ? <eos>

<s> lloyd johnston ph.d. is a leading mandated funded scientist on the subject of marijuana usage rates yet admits that there have never to his understanding been one study that compared marijuana usage rates in the decriminalized states to rates in the other states in the u.s. other that the one in which researchers conclude that `` decriminalization has had practically no effect either on the marijuana use or on related attitudes and belief about marijuana use among american young people in this age group . '' in reason the use of marijuana in adolescents has skyrocketed after prohibition . studies further show that increased penelties for usage have had no effect on trends in adolescent marijuana use rates either . <eos>

@highlight

<s> government research discounts relationships b/w criminality and usage . <eos>
