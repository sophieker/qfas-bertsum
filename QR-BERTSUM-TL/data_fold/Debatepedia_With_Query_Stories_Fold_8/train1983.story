<s> health : is using natural gas healthy for humans ? <eos>

<s> `` why natural gas is dangerous '' . alliant energy - `` when natural gas first comes out of the ground you can t see it or smell it . that s why gas companies add a chemical that smells like rotten eggs to the gas to make even the smallest leaks easy to notice ... luckily natural gas leaks are rare . fires and explosions are even more uncommon the rotten egg smell helps people get help quickly before anything bad happens . a minute amount of odorant such as t-butyl mercaptan with a rotting-cabbage-like smell is added to the otherwise colorless and almost odorless gas so that leaks can be detected before a fire or explosion occurs . sometimes a related compound thiophane is used with a rotten-egg <eos>
