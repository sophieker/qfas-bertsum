<s> children : are the offspring of incestuous couples healthy or at-risk ? <eos>

<s> it is well known that the risks involved in blood relatives procreating are enormous . deformities are common and genetic disorders are much more likely than in the population at large . the state has a compelling interest in preventing such suffering and the practice of incest that causes it . it is compassionate to the deformed/disordered child the parents that must suffer through the experience and the society that must provide for the extra health requirements of such a child . <eos>

@highlight

<s> children of incest are at greater risk of disorders <eos>
