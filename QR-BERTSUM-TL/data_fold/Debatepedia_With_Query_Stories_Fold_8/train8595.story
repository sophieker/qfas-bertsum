<s> democracy : will a republic make australia more democratic ? is this important ? <eos>

<s> australia is not a monarchy . it is a democratic republic that puts the power in the hands of its people but that also has small largely-symbolic monarchic presence in the form of the queen and the governor general . this is why its can be considered a `` crowned republic '' . since australia is already a republic it need not be re-made into a different kind of republic . it is a sufficiently sound republic as is . <eos>
