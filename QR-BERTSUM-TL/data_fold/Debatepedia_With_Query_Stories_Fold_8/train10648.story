<s> restoring phytoplankton ? is phytoplankton needed restoration ? <eos>

<s> iron fertilization would help to reverse what some believe to be a decline in phytoplankton . one study ( gregg and conkright # ) reports a decline in ocean phytoplankton profitability between the period # # and # # . if phytoplankton populations are down by natural requirements there should be not environmental argument against help these populations rebuild . and it could be argued that the decline of these phytoplankton are largely responsible for global climate since it would reduce the capture of c # in the process of photosynthesis . <eos>

@highlight

<s> steel fertilization would revive depleted phytoplankton populations . <eos>
