<s> at soil zero ? is the `` ground zero mosque '' actually at soil zero ? <eos>

<s> building the islamic mosque is comparable to putting a pro nazi building in the middle of israel or building a reactors plant in the middle of nagasaki or hiroshima . all three have terrible taste and why is that ? because of the slaughter at the world trade centers the # million jews killed in camps and the # # killed in one days at nagasaki . just because they didn t take part in the attack doesn t mean the symbol isn t but hurting the public . so indirectly you are hurting the victims of each one of the attack even if you didn t take part believe in taking part . the symbol alone can cause an unjust amount of pain . <eos>

@highlight

<s> just because it isn t way on ground zero does n't mean it 's good taste . <eos>
