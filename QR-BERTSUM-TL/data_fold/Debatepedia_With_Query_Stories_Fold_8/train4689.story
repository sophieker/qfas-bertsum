<s> unwanted/adoption : is abortions ok in dealt with `` unwanted '' children ? vs adoption ? <eos>

<s> if a child is likely to face social difficulty this is absolutely no reason to seeking an abortion . the notion that a child will be unhappy due to these conditions or will have no chances of successful is ludicrous . it is easy to finding example of poor and neglected children that have grown up to become thriving successful and happy adults . in any case if social problems are the concern these problems should be addressed ; abortion is a terrible band-aid . saying that a child would encounter social problems during his or her development is not the same as saying that he or she is better off dead . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortion is not a just response to social problems faced the unborn <eos>
