'' retrieved april # st # - `` today [ the monarchy ] represents the denial of total power . while the crown is at the head of all our great institutions of state nobody else can be the head of any of them . thus the crown represents the ultimate and untouchable guarantee of our freedom and our genius . republicans resent the power that the crown denies them . they resent the senate having the power to block supply to a rogue government . they resent the governor-general 's ability to sack a rogue prime minister .
