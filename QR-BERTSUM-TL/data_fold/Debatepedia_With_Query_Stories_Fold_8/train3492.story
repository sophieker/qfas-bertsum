<s> tax rebate : is the proposed tax rebate a good idea ? <eos>

<s> although tax rebates increased unemployment benefits and other short-term payments may feel good and appear superficially attractive they do very little to actually boost the economy and improve americans ' well-being . rather cutting tax rates not mailing tax rebates is what stimulates prosperity . this is a critical distinction . the primary reason why tax rebates do n't work is that they merely redistribute existing wealth as opposed to creating new economic growth or encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship . they do nothing to encourage risk-taking investment or enlargement of the wealth pie but instead re-slice the existing pie in a zero-sum manner . <eos>
