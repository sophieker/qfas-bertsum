<s> china/india : should chinese and india be held to lower emission standards ? <eos>

<s> while many presume that china is a `` developing '' nation many others particularly in the too poorer parts of the third world in south east asia consider china to be in the `` developed '' category . china was after the third biggest economy in the world at the begin of # . as a `` developed '' nation china would certainly have a greater obligation to fight global warming . emissions exemptions would violate this obligation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china is basically `` developed '' with lower `` obligation '' . <eos>
