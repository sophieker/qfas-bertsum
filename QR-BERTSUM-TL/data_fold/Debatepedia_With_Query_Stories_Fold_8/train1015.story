<s> experience : does mccain have more experience than obama ? <eos>

<s> obama has a very strong legislative history as a us senator . the daily kos lists # legislative successes for obama during his senate career while only # legislative successes for clinton . it is argued that obama 's record of successes is in large part due to his ability to convince other senators to support his legislation . clinton with a more divisive history does not appear to have this same capacity . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama has a strong record of legislative achievement <eos>
