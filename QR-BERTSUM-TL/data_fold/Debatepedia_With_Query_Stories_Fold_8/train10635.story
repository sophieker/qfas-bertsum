<s> representation : is an elected president a superior form of representation ? <eos>

<s> people hate the future direction of the european union . issues such as cap asylum etc . etc . can all be solved without the imposition of a directly elected vice who would take power away from the country states therefore taking the european unions even further from people s consciousness . an alternative proposal would be for the councils of ministers to end the rotating six-month presidency and for its member states to appoint a politicians to run the councils s meetings and represent europe more effectively .

@highlight

<s> an eu president would not represent individual eu states well . <eos>
