<s> broad strategy : is a continuation of the war in iraq contrary to us/coalition interests ? <eos>

<s> getting out too soon will simply reinforce the views of those who thought the invasion wrong in the first place . on the other hand staying in iraq to secure peace democracy and human rights will set a positive example to other countries and show that the values for which the war was publicly fought were genuine ; to spread democracy with conviction and determination . <eos>

@highlight

<s> succeeding in iraq will help justify the war and those who supported it . <eos>
