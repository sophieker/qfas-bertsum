<s> is space a better place for solar panels than the earth 's surface ? <eos>

<s> space radiation degrade solar panels . earth 's atmosphere protects the surface of earth from various kinds of high energetic particles from space . when in space solar panels are exposed to full amount of this radiation ; both solar wind and cosmic rays degrade the performance of solar cells . this limits the choice of materials suitable for long-term deployment in space . <eos>
