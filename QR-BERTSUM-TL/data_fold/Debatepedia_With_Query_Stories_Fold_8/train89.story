<s> economics : is labeling gm foods financially sound ? <eos>

<s> labeling of genetic modification foods costs money . it is not free . it requires that all companies be regulated that they ensure that they have or do not have a certain levels of gm ingredient in their foods and that labels be placed on these food products . this could be very expensive . this could harm prices jobs salaries and overall economic health . it could also probably require an increase in taxes to fund new regulatory body for gm foods . <eos>
