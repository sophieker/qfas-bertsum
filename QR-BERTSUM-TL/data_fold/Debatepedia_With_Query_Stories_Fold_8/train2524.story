<s> environment : is mountaintop removal coal mining environmentally damaging ? <eos>

<s> chris hamilton of the west virginia coal association said in # : `` restoring the land occurs in about # percent to # percent of former surface mines . we rebuild the mountain peak resculpting it to roughly as close as possibility to the original premining topography of the land then we reseed it with grasses and trees . we also rebuild the drainage channel putting in sediments and erosion-control structures to prevent potential downstream impacts .

@highlight

<s> small percentages of mining mines are open ones . <eos>
