<s> justice : are juveniles in juvenile court being punished too mildly ? <eos>

<s> no matter the exact age of the criminal particular damage can not be undone ( murder rape ... ) . victims and/or their families do carry the consequences therefore is is just that the offender gets punished appropriately based not on age but severity of the crime . <eos>

@highlight

<s> crime is never a crime repercussions are never the same . <eos>
