<s> `` encyclopedia '' : is wikipedia an `` encyclopedia '' or is this too strong a word ? <eos>

<s> it is unfair for critics of wikipedia to alienate this online encyclopedia as `` unreliable '' or a poor reference guide . it must be noted that it is generally frowned upon in the academic community to reference encyclopedias of any kind . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no encyclopedia ( including wikipedia ) is a reliable primary source <eos>
