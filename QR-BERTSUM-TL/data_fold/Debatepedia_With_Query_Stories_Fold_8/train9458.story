<s> implementation : is investment punishments implemented consistently and fairly ? <eos>

<s> instances of discriminatory in capital punishment cases does not mean capital punishment is wrong . rather it would simply shows that the judicial system is acted with bias . yet it would be unnecessary and inappropriate to bans capital punishment on these grounds . the problems should be solved by reforms that would ensure that the judiciary is not discriminating . <eos>

@highlight

<s> any discriminatory in capital punishment cases can be correcting <eos>
