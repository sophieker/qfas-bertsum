<s> harming to others : are smokers harming other people ? <eos>

<s> it is true that smoke-filled environments can be unpleasant for non-smokers but there are reasonable and responsible ways around this - smoking rooms in offices and airports are an excellent example . some bars and restaurants may choose to be non-smoking establishments giving customers the choice to select their environment . allowing people to make their own adult decisions is surely always the best option . restricting smoking in public places may sometimes be appropriate banning it altogether would be excessive .

<s> `` passive smoking '' can be reduced without draconian restrictions . <eos>
