<s> child protections : do full-body scanners protect rights of minors ? <eos>

<s> arthur weinreb . `` full-body scanners ; it 's just common sense . '' canada free press . january # # : `` minors should be scanned and to link these scans to child porn is ludicrous . police officers routinely possess child pornography all the time . not only do they possess it but they distribute it to prosecutors who further distribute it to defense lawyers . then the prosecutors further distribute it to judges who show juries . for some reason these people aren t considered to have committed criminal acts because they are doing what they do to protect the public . just like those who operate full body scanners are doing . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> security scans of children are not pornographic <eos>
