<s> civil war ? could an early withdrawal avoid causing a civil war ? <eos>

<s> coalition forces are considered `` occupiers '' in iraq . as a result when the coalition works predominantly with shiites on security and in the iraqi government shiites are subsequently viewed by sunnis as `` collaborators '' . this makes it more difficult for sunnis to work with shiites out of fear of being branded as working with the `` collaborators '' ; in effect being labeled `` collaborators '' themselves . a us withdrawal would eliminate these fears of cooperation and help avoid civil war . <eos>

<s> an early withdrawal would end sunni fears of working with shiite `` collaborators '' <eos>
