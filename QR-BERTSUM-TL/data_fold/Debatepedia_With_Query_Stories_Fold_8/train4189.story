<s> is prostitutes a criminalized crime ? <eos>

<s> it is not difficult to decipher who the victims of prostitution are . just about everyone involved in this debate has assumed that prostitute denotes 'woman ' and inform their arguments with this preconception . is this because women choose to sell their bodies and men do not ? despite intellectual reasoning and rhetoric we all know that it is primarily women who are exploited ; we all subconsciously know through an understanding of the cultural history we 've inherited -patriarchy- that it is women who do and will suffer . in terms therefore the female sexuality suffers from the existence of prostitution . this inequality makes the suffer particularly egregious . <eos>

@highlight

<s> women in general are the victim of prostitution . <eos>
