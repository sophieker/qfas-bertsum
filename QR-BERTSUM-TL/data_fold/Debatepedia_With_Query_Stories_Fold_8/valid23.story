<s> democratic : was devolution in wales and scotland achieved undemocratically ? <eos>

<s> in the devolution referendum of # the voter apathy of the scottish and welsh electorate was such that there was insufficient democratic mandate for devolution . in scotland of a # % turnout # % voted `` yes '' i.e . only an overall # % of the entire population actually voted `` yes '' . in wales the figures are even lower with # % turnout and # % voted `` yes '' thus resulting in an overall # % of the welsh population voting `` yes '' . this is clearly not a resounding approval for scottish and welsh devolution and this important constitutional matter was not supported by the true majority . <eos>
