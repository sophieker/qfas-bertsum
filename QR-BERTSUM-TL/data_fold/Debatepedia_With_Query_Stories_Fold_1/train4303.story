<s> environment/general : is solar energy generally environmentally friendly ? <eos>

<s> because the sun 's rays are diffuse solar panels must occupy substantial territory to generate any significant quantities of power . as a result solar energy is land-intensive and creates a pressure to clear land of trees and vegetation to make way for solar panels . owners of solar panels on home rooftops may also have an incentive to cut-down trees that are blocking solar panels from the sun 's rays . this is a significant ecological threat . <eos>
