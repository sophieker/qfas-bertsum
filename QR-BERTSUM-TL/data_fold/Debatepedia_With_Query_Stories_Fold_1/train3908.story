<s> `` right to die '' ? does every citizen have a `` right to die '' at a time of choice ? <eos>

<s> every right includes a choice . the right to speech does not remove the option to remain silent ; the right to vote gives with it the right to abstain . in the same way the right to choosing to die is implicit in the right to life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the way to lives includes a way to die . <eos>
