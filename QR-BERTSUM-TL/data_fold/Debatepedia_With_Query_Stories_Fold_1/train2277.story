<s> usage : does war on drugs reducing usage ? <eos>

<s> `` how to stop the drugs wars . '' the economist . mar # th # > `` fear [ of legalisation ] is based in large part on the presumption that more people would take drugs under a legal regime . that presumption may be wrong . there is no correlations between the harshness of drugs law and the incidence of drug-taking : citizens living under tough regimes ( notably america but also britain ) take more drugs not fewer . embarrassed drugs warriors blame this on alleged cultural differences but even in fairly similar countries tough rules making little difference to the numbers of addicts : harsh sweden and more liberal norway have precisely the same addiction rates . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> drugs prohibition does not correlated with decreased use <eos>
