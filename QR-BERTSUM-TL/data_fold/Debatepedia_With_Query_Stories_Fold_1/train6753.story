<s> getting to marriage : are civil unions a good stepping stone to marriage ? <eos>

<s> andrew sullivan . `` why 'civil union ' is n't marriage . '' the new republic . may 8 2000 : `` to concede that gay adults are responsible citizens to concede that there will be no tangible damage to the institution of marriage by their inclusion within it and then to offer gay men and women a second-class institution called civil union makes no sense . '' [ while it may be `` a step in the right direction '' it is always unjustified to take steps - such as civil unions - that can not be justified on principle . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if gays get civil unions why withhold `` marriage '' ? <eos>
