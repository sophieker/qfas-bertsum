<s> state interests : are state interests upheld in the primary election process ? <eos>

<s> national party organizations do not assign delegates on the basis of population but through a convoluted mix of political considerations . this means that two states with the same size populations may be given very different numbers of delegates . this means that the votes of citizens in different states count differently and that states generally are valued unequally . <eos>

@highlight

<s> primary election delegates are not distributed fairly between states <eos>
