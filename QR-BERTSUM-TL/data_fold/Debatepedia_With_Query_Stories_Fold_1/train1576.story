<s> health : is the colonization of the moon healthy for humans ? <eos>

<s> it is critical that humans begin the process of understanding the health implications of living on alien planets including the moon mars and possibly others in the distant future . this requires understanding - among other things - the implications of living in a lower-gravity planet such as the moon and developing techniques - such as artificial gravity - to cope with any issues that may arise . the moon is an ideal place to begin this technological process . <eos>

@highlight

<s> moonbase advances knowledge of human viability on alien planets . <eos>
