<s> legitimacy : was the invading of afghanistan illegal/illegitimate ? is continuing it illegal/illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> following iraq 's invasion of kuwait and the un-mandated us-led expulsion of iraqi troops from kuwait the un passed resolution # which called for iraq to disarmed its wmd stockpiles or face law by `` all required means '' . at the time of the decisions to go to war in # iraq was believed to have not disarmed its wmd stockpiles . the # invasion therefore could be justified on the basis of iraq 's non-compliance with resolution # and that resolution 's mandate for law directly `` all required means '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iraq ever disarmed after kuwait welcoming the using of force <eos>
