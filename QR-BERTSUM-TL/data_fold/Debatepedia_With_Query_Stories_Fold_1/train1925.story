<s> morality : would the ban on downloading uphold our moral pillars ? <eos>

<s> crime should not pay and after crime comes punishment . two basic pillars or or legislation . if we turn a blind eye towards internet piracy we are in effect undermining our set of values which clearly is immoral . legal downloading clearly shows that art is naturally free thus removes incentives to pay for it in the future . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the prohibition sends the right message . <eos>
