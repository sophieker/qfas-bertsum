<s> individual rights : are insurance mandates consistently with individual rights ? <eos>

<s> the uninsured do two things that adding to costs . second when they do go to the hospital they go to the emergency rooms which is paid for by the taxpayers in most cases . second by not contributing money to the general risk pool the insured have a smaller pool of resources to draw on when they get sick meaning that insurance companies have to increase premiums . <eos>

@highlight

<s> uninsured increase cost for all ; mandated are appropriate . <eos>
