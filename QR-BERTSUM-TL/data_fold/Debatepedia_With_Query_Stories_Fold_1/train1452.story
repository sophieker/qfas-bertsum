<s> if torture ... if water-boarding is `` torture '' is it still ok sometimes ? see debate : torture <eos>

<s> it is justified to use water-boarding because it saves lives . saving life is the first obligation of the government ; `` to provide for the common defense . '' the idea of saving life must be held above ethical principles . scenario : it would be justified for a kid in school to attack another kid if he tried to stab a lower classmate . this scenario can be applied to the we and its government . not only is the government justified in using water-boarding it is an obligation too as well if there is sufficient evidence that lead to the saving of lives . <eos>
