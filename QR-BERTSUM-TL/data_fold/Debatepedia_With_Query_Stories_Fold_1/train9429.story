<s> cleared mines : is cleared mines an insufficient solution ? <eos>

<s> the use of land mines in war time or a tense environment is a totally separated issue to washing them up in peace time ; efforts to blur the two together by pro-ban commentators should be resisted . the however can be fixed no banning the former . the proposition completely accepts that the consequence of keeping land mines legal is an obligation on the part of those that use them to fund clean-up efforts and the usa is surely doing this in many struggling countries . the concern of the very humanitarian organisations calling for a bans will ensure this obligation is met . <eos>

@highlight

<s> efforts to clear landmines should be improved instead bans them . <eos>
