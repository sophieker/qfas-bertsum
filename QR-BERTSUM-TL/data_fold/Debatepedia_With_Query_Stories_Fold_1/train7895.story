<s> security : are the appointers a security risk ? <eos>

<s> the concern over wear burqas on public transportation seems to surround fears about suicide bombers use them to conceal their identity before detonating a bomb . but suicide bombers have never needed to or really wanted to conceal their identity before commit their act . rather they simply strap on explosives under pants clothing go to crowded places and blow themselves up without concern about getting caught and punished because clearly they will be dead . so a ban on the burqa will do anything to prevent a determined suicide bomber from commit their act . therefore a burqa ban does little to help counter terrorism and ensure national security . <eos>

<s> suicidal bombers do n't care to disguise identity copies burqas . <eos>
