<s> human rights : is health care a human right ? <eos>

<s> the mere act that a un body on human rights has added that to their charter is not definitive of anything . using it as an argument fails as it 's only an appeal to authority . <eos>

@highlight

<s> whether health care is a right under i-law is inconsequential . <eos>
