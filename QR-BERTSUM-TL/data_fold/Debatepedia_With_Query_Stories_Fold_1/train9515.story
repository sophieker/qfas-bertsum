<s> global warming : can hydropower help cut emissions fight global warming ? <eos>

<s> a # world commission on dams report concluded : `` all large dams and natural lakes in the boreal and tropical regions that have been measured emit greenhouse gases some values for gross emissions are extremely low and may be ten times less than the thermal option . yet in some cases the gross emissions can be considerable and possibly greater than the thermal alternatives '' . [ # ] this indicates that dams can be created that emit `` ten times less than the thermal option '' . the methods used to create these clean dams can and should be followed can eliminte concerns regarding methane emissions and can preserve hydroelectric power as a global warming solution . <eos>
