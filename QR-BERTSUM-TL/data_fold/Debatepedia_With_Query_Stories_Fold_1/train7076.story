<s> schools : do student voucher improve the quality of schools ? <eos>

<s> the key differences between a k- # and a university systems is that the u.s. university systems receives a substantial portion of its funding from students and subsidies to students in the form of scholarships government grants and subsidized loans . this is argued to be conceptually equivalent to school vouchers because the money is provided ultimately to the student and in such a way that the student 's ability to choose between schools is maintained . because choice is maintained universities must compete harder to attract students which those advocates argue is the key ingredient in the relative success of the universities systems over the k- # system . thus some argue that a similar competition-inducing approach should be taking with the k- # systems through <eos>

@highlight

<s> universities succeed because they are more think vouchers system . <eos>
