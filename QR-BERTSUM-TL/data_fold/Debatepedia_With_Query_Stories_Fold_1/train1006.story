<s> globally warming : is corn ethanol useful in fighting globally warming ? <eos>

<s> any plant when grown draws carbon dioxide from the air in the process of photosynthesis . corn grown for ethanol is just the same . when it is burned and emits carbon dioxide into the air it is actually only emitting the carbon dioxide that it had previously drawn out of the atmosphere . in this sense corn ethanol is partly neutral in its carbon dioxide emissions ; it gives and takes equally . fuel and natural gas on the other hand are releasing new carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . the overall result is that corn ethanol production and use is far better for the environment and global warming . <eos>

<s> wheat grown for ethanol acts first as a carbon sink <eos>
