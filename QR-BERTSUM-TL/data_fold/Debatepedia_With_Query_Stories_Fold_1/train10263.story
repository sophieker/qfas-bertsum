<s> barages : are tidal barages a good idea ? <eos>

<s> bays and estuaries are always naturally `` flushed '' or cleansed and replenish by tide-waters flows in and out . to the extent that tidal electricity impairs the natural flows of these tides it impairs this natural `` flushing '' mechanism . tampered with this mechanism can have unpredictable and even calamitous consequences for an ecosystem . <eos>

<s> tidal barrages energy can impairs the natural `` flushing '' of water ecosystems . <eos>
