<s> inspiration : would a mission to the moon be more inspiring ? <eos>

<s> the world is ensnared in a number of major conflicts and challenges at present . some label the rift between the islamic world and the west and a `` clash of civilizations '' . an inspiring mission to mars can help soften our attitudes to other humans and resolve these conflicts . a mission to the moon can not do so as well and such a mission would delay the pacifying effect of a mission to mars . but this should not be delayed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> world needs inspiring mars mission now ; moon-mission delays this . <eos>
