<s> parenting : can homosexuals do a good job of parenting ? <eos>

<s> margarette somerville . `` the case against gay marriage . '' mcgill center for medicine ethics and law . april 29 2003 : `` there is an ethical difference between individuals choosing to create such a situation [ of a gay couple raising a child ] and society authorizing or facilitating it [ through marriage ] . while society would have ethical obligations not to interfere with the freedom of individuals in relation to reproduction [ ... ] it also has obligations not to facilitate the creation of situations that are not in the best interests of children . in short the compliance of society in helping to create non-traditional families in which children will be raised is not an ethically neutral act .
