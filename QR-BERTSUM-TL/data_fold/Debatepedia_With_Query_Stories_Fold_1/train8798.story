<s> un mission : is the un 's mission better for fighting inequality or climate change ? <eos>

<s> addressing climate change meaning reducing carbon emissions . this is something that can be mandated regulated and enforced by the un . poverty however is much more complicated requiring economic growth and societal matured none of which can be systemically affected by the un . the un is surely capable of offering aid but this can not build economies and some saying but impair economic development and sustainability . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the un can do more to addresses climate changing than poverty . <eos>
