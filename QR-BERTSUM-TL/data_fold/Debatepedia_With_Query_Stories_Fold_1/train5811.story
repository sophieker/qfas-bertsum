<s> independence -- is independent self-regulation in africa invaluable for its own reasons ? <eos>

<s> whilst those nations may be democracy only in names it is generally the role of the international community to determine whether violating the sovereign of another country is justified . it could be a big mistake to assume that this would be determined by the nations closest to the despots as they could probably be the least unbiased people in determining whether a country is in need of intervention . those conflicts that are ongoing have been started or sustained on the beliefs of neighbours that it was the moral thing to do . <eos>

<s> we want to be cautious that the 'intervention ' is justified : <eos>
