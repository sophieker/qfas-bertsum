<s> cultures/sexism : is it sound linguistically to allow for gender selection ? <eos>

<s> women are already seeing in the majority of cultures as less valuable than men . sex selection is not support by the universal declaration of humans rights ; its writers did not imagine recent developments but did include rights for equal treatment and status for women which allowing gender selection would undermine . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sexuality selection will re-enforce sexuality discrimination <eos>
