<s> threat : does the communist party present a threat ? <eos>

<s> what `` threat '' are we talking about ? if it violent harm that is one thing . but other forms of harm risk being arbitrary . non-extremist political parties may claim for example that the policies of other political parties are doing society `` harm '' and thus they pose a threat . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` threat '' to society is an overly subjective criteria for the banning of extremist groups from politics . <eos>
