<s> famine : is debt cancellation important in fighting famine ? <eos>

<s> in order to raise the cash for debt repayments poor countries have to produce goods which they can sell around the world . often this means growing so-called cash crops such as coffee instead of food to support their population . people in fertile countries can find themselves starving as they can not afford to buy the food which then has to be bought from other countries while their own fields produce coffee for the developed world . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debts forces countries to produce `` cash crops '' that do n't help famine . <eos>
