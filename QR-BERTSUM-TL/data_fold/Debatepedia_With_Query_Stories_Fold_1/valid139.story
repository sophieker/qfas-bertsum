<s> rights : is `` do n't ask do n't tell '' inconsistent with citizens ' rights ? <eos>

<s> this is the same cases as with african-americans during the wwii . they were n't allowed to fight in the war ( only until several laws were passed ) . the african-american situations was different to our situation . just because of some fictious bigoted beliefs the african-americans were n't allowed to serve in combat make both the nation outraged and the african-americans frustrated . the same applies to gays . it 's also just because of some fictious bigoted beliefs that homosexuals ca n't fight as well . <eos>

<s> what about african-americans ? <eos>
