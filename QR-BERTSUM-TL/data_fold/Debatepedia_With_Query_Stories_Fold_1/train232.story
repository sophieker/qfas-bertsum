<s> silent mode : is silent mode okay or should they be turned off ? <eos>

<s> there will be no disruption if the students are required to keep their cell phones in their pockets and not use them for calling or texting except in an emergency . this would be more convenient for calling for a ride after school or making a phone call if an emergency happens at school . <eos>
