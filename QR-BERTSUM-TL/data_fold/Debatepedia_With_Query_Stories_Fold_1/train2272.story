<s> conflict : which better manages and possibly prevents conflict war ? <eos>

<s> when capitalism is faced with troubles it 's typical reaction ( it meaning the elites who run the show ) is to steal from the poor so as to offset the ( minor ) losses that the rich have experienced . a brief look at history will confirm this but here is a recent example that illustrates this point : one of the ways the rich countries have reacted to the 2009 economic crisis is to make massive land grabs in poor countries mostly africa . now most of africa is in a food crisis but the rich countries have still bought huge amounts of land to profit off . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism does not peacefully accept losses . <eos>
