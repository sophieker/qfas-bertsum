<s> before the whale is harpooned it is usually exhausted by a long and hectic chase . as a move target it is impossible for a marksman to achieve a direct hit on a whale with an explosive-tipped harpoon so those are wounded and survived for those minute before finally being killed by rifles shots or by additional harpoons . even when a direct hit is scored the explosive often fails to detonate . overall japanese whaling ships reports that only # % of whales are killed instantly by the first shot .
