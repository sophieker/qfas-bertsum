<s> economics : are mandatory calorie counts economically friendly ? <eos>

<s> enforcing calorie count laws will be very expensive as it requires that the government test and re-test each restaurant 's foods to ensure that they continue to live up to the calorie counts they have provided on their menu . because there is often a very clear incentive to under-record the calorie count enforcement could be very difficult and require significant staffing and funding on the part of the government . <eos>
