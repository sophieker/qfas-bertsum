<s> enforcement : can health insurances mandates be effectively enforced ? <eos>

<s> the most important thing with healthcare insurance mandates - and penalty for non-compliance - is that they create a general incentive to buy insurance and a general discouragement of going without . this will certainly help close the gap of the uninsured strengthen the risk pool among the insured and generally improve insurance costs and quality as a result . of course those people will still shirk the mandate and their responsibility to obtain insurance . but as long as a significant number of uninsured are compelled to get insurance as a result of a mandate the mandate will prove beneficial to the system the insured those formerly uninsured that now have insurance and the country as a whole . <eos>

@highlight

<s> healthcare insurance mandates need not be perfectly enforced to be effective . <eos>
