<s> while some instances of plea bargaining and plea bargaining in exchange for testimony may be justified it is the extremes prevalence of these practice that is the problem . # percent of all cases are concluded by plea bargaining rather of trial by jury . the prevalence of plea bargains in exchange for testimony is which very high . same that the constitution calls for trial by jury it is unfair that there is such a high rate of plea bargaining and plea bargaining in exchange for testimony . at a minimum measure should be take to reduce the rate of these practices . <eos>
