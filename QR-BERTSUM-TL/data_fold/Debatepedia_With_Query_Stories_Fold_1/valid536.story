<s> smokers quantities : would a smokers ban reducing smokers overall ? <eos>

<s> heavy smokers are unlikely to give up since they are addicted to nicotine . banning smoking in public will therefore only encourage people to smoke more at home . this will harms other people in their houses especially children . this is important since child are not old enough to choose freely to smoke passively . which people smoking at home may drink more alcohol than they would if they went to a bar . this is because they can buy it more inexpensively at a grocery or off-license . drinking more alcohol may lead to other health problems . <eos>
