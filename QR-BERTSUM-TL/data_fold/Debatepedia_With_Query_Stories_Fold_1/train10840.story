<s> no public option : is reform acceptable w/o public option ? <eos>

<s> paul krugman . `` pass the bill '' . new york times op-ed . december # # > `` the private option was always a means to an end : real competition for insurers an alternative for consumers to existing private plans that does not deny needed care or shift risks onto the vulnerable the ability to provide affordable coverage over time . i thought it was the best means throughout our political grasp . it lay just beyond that grasp . but its demise -- in this round -- does not lessen the immediate necessity of those larger aims . and even without the private option the bill that congress passes and the president sign could move us substantially toward those goals . '' <eos>

<s> health care reform still invaluable without public option <eos>
