<s> settlements : is a two-state solutions possibility in the context of settlements ? <eos>

<s> the intent of the israel settlers - and of any government policy official and unofficial that has support the settlers - has often been to squeeze the palestinians out of the `` israeli homeland '' ( including both the west bank and gaza ) . this objective is unjust as it denies the right of the palestinians to exist in what has been their historic homeland . it is wrong therefore to use the settlements as a justification for denying the palestinians their own state ( even if it is only argued as a matters of practicality ) . this is precisely what nefarious settlers have intended to do from the beginning : create facts on the ground that becoming too impractical for israel and the worlds to deal with <eos>

@highlight

<s> israel settlements ought not justifying deny palestinians a state . <eos>
