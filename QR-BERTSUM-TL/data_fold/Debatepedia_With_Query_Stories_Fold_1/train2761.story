<s> relationships : does pornography add/subtract from relationships ? <eos>

<s> julian sanchez . `` porndultery . '' june # th # : `` the more relevant problem is what we could call loosely betrayal of exclusive initimacy . but this is where mediation makes all the difference . you don t have a relationship with aurora snow by dint of watching one of her movies ; you re certainly not at any great risk of running off with her . all of which is to say sex is not really a substitute for the sort of gratification that comes from real intimacy with a partner . i m going to suppose that everybody s implicit understanding involves an agreement not to get 'gratification ' from any other source a nice crystal of wine a good novel a game of pickup basketball . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> porn is no substitutes for self-gratification of relationships . <eos>
