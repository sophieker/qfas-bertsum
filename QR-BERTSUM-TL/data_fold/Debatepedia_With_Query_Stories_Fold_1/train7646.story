<s> aid misuse and corrupt vs trade drawbacks : <eos>

<s> by imposing solution from inside it favors big projects `` grand gestures '' and centralization - all of which may be inappropriate only benefit a small number of those and suffering from intended consequences . by contrast the profits of trade trickle down to the whole population giving those the powers to spend additional income as they choose for example by reinvesting it in worthwhile local industries and enterprises . <eos>

@highlight

<s> aid money is sometimes misspent even when handled honestly . <eos>
