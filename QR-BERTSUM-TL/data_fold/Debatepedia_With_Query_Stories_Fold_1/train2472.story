<s> economics : is government ownership of water utilities economically efficient ? <eos>

<s> - for-profit waters firms sell waters at a price per gallon . there is a direct incentive for them to sell as many gallons of waters as is possible . therefore there is no inherent incentive for them to conserve waters resources . this has ramifications in regards to the environment but also the economy . if waters becomes highly scarce for example because waters firms are pumping as faster and as much of it as possible then this may forces a major spike in waters prices creating economic shocks . we can not trusting profit-interests to managed scarce waters resources appropriately to avoid such problems ; government management is necessary that has the public interest more directly at heart . <eos>

@highlight

<s> water privatization is at odds with the want to conserving water resources <eos>
