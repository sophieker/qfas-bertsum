<s> humans rights : is healthcare health a humans right ? <eos>

<s> people pay for public utilities such as roads and people pay for education as well . but do people who do n't drive irresponsibly ask for money back when highways are damaged ? do people who send their children to private school ask for all their money back ? we place this burden on the states because of equality of opportunity . no man should be denied the right to live his life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> universally healthcare care is a legitimate `` burden '' on the taxes payer . <eos>
