<s> does `` earth hour '' help the environment ? <eos>

<s> during the hour most people used candles or torches instead of electric lights as a source of light . candles are bad for the global warming issue and so are batteries . dead batteries produce carbon emissions and are bad for the environment and global warming . most people who were n't using candles used battery-powered torches and that is still bad for the environment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people also use torches . <eos>
