<s> historical lessons : does history suggest the war in afghanistan can not be won ? <eos>

<s> the main difference is that the us was backing the insurgents against the soviet union whereas today there is no such great-power backing of the taliban . <eos>

@highlight

<s> soviet war in afghanistan is not analogous to us/nato war <eos>
