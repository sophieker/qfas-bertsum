<s> national identity : do the roma have a stronger cultural and national identities fitting for independence ? <eos>

<s> of the several hundred delegates who gathered at the prague senate few were democratically elected and none came from hungary home to the most politically conscious gypsies . few gypsies in the ghettoes have ever heard of the organisation . indeed a reluctance to vote and the difficulty of holding democratic elections and producing an accountable and representative leader for an ill-defined transnational minority is one of the practical stumbling blocks to granting the roma nationhood . romany people see themselves indistinctly if at all . romany culture is one of patriarchal families and sometimes clans but ever a nation . even the # romany parties within slovakia failing to form a national coalition due to mutual dislike .

<s> the iru should not be considered representatives of the worlds s romany people : <eos>
