<s> humaneness : could the culling of kangaroos be doing humanely ? <eos>

<s> the sale of australian-kangaroo adidas shoes was actually banned in california usa for # years as well as some other place around the world . these bans are based in a strong case for objecting to the commercial killing of kangaroos for their beef and for their pelts . the case centers on the notion that kangaroos are an exceptionally intelligent animal with a certain historical kinship to humans that deserves exceptional human compassion . <eos>

@highlight

<s> commercial use of kangaroo beef and leather is unethical . <eos>
