<s> inclusiveness : is `` merry christmas '' inclusive enough ? <eos>

<s> the term `` happy holidays '' is inclusive of `` merry christmas '' and christians . however `` merry christmas '' does not include other holidays . so the effort to `` keep christ in christmas '' is actually an effort to `` keep non-christians out of christmas . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` happy holidays '' is inclusive vs exclusive `` merry christmas '' . <eos>
