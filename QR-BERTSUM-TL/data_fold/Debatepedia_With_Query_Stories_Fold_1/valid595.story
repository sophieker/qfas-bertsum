<s> safe vs. liberty : can the interest of safe take precedence over the interests of liberty in justify interment ? <eos>

<s> life itself is the greatest liberty of all as all other liberties depend on its maintenance . for this reason one of the greatest obligations of a governments is to protect the lives of its citizens . if other liberties are sacrificed in the interests of security this should not be seen necessarily as a sacrifices of liberty but rather a trade-off and prioritizing among various liberties . it is essential that enemy combatants be held securely until they no longer pose a threat to the liberties . <eos>

@highlight

<s> by protecting lives internment is protecting the greatest liberty of all : life . <eos>
