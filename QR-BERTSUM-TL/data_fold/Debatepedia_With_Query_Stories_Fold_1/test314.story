'' above the law . july # th # : `` # . not everyone graduates with debt ( or with as much debt as some those think ) . i was lucky enough to graduate law school debt-free ; my parents paid for my college and law school . and i m not alone . according to the law school surveys of student engagement ( figure # ) over # percent of law students will graduate with zero debt and another # percent or so will graduate with less than $ # # in student loans . so someplace between # and # percent of law school graduates leave school with little to no debt and a invaluable professional degree to show for their efforts . <eos>
