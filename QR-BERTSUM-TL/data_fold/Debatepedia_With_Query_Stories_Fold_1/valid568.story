<s> economics : would public ownership of water be more economical than a global commons ? <eos>

<s> - for profit firms are manage by individuals with a direct for-profit stake in the efficiency and productivity of their company . if they manage their company poorly they losing money . if they manage their company well they profit . it is this direct profit-interest at the managerial level that ensures for-profit firms in general perform efficiently . paradoxically there is not profit interest at the managerial level in government-owned companies . if the government-owned company performs highly efficiently or somewhat efficiently it matters less to managers of these firms because it does not typically affect them monetarily . therefore for-profit firms have a greater incentive structure for the efficient operations of its company and the empirical evidence generally demonstrates this to hold true . <eos>
