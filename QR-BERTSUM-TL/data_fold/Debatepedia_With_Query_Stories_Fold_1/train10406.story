<s> does the fact that there were no star in the backgrounds mean the # moon landing be have been faked ? <eos>

<s> all the lunar landings occured on the daylight side of the moon . with the sun above them it would be impossible for them to see any stars in the sky . the same hold true in low-earth orbit from the spaces shuttle or the spaces station . pictures in low-earth orbit taken on the daylight side of earth never feature stars either . the thought that stars could possibly be seen in spaces while the sun is in the sky is the product of works of fiction . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the sunlight of the sunlight works exactly the same ways on the moon as it does on the earth or <eos>
