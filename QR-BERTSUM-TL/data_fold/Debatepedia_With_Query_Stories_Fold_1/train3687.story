<s> judgment : are younger individuals able to judge whether to join ? <eos>

<s> in fact the media usually focusing on the bad news coming out of afghanistan and iraq ignoring the good work of our military there . a career in the military which offers younger people a lot of benefits and it is only right that they should get to hear about those as well . and no one is signed up on the spot in the classroom ; they always get the chance to think about it over a few months or more and to discuss the decision carefully with parents . <eos>

@highlight

<s> younger people are n't stupid understand risk of join military . <eos>
