<s> checks and balances : does the icc have sufficient checks and balances ? <eos>

<s> henry kissinger . `` the pitfalls of universal jurisdiction : risking judicial tryanny '' . foreign affairs . aug. 2001 - `` the independent prosecutor of the icc has the power to issue indictments subject to review only by a panel of three judges . according to the rome statute the security council has the right to quash any indictment . but since revoking an indictment is subject to the veto of any permanent security council member and since the prosecutor is unlikely to issue an indictment without the backing of at least one permanent member of the security council he or she has virtually unlimited discretion in practice . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> icc prosecutors are given too much power in deciding cases <eos>
