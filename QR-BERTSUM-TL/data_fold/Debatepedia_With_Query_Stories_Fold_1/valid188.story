<s> are the requirements of what you can take on-board aircraft too strict ? <eos>

<s> many people when flying now have to abide by many restrictions . they are a big hassle and are annoying to the public . things like not being allowed to take more than # ml of liquids but if a # ml bottle is nearly empty ( that happened to me ) and if you take baby food you are asked to eat it to ensure it does not containing an explosive device . it is these kinds of things that annoy people and is unnecessary . # . # % of people are not terrorists and yet everybody is treatment as a suspect . <eos>
