<s> economic efficiencies : would universal health care be more economically efficient ? <eos>

<s> when a country 's population ages the strain of a universal health care program grows with a larger percentage of the population reaching an age in which they require health care . therefore in countries where the population is aging it may be important to avoid a universal health care program . <eos>

@highlight

<s> aging countries can not afford universal health care . <eos>
