<s> abuse : can abuse of earmarks be avoided ? <eos>

<s> robert reich . `` house of ill-repute : it 's time to ban earmarks '' . common dreams . september 12 2006 - `` the conventional view in the house is americans really do n't care about lobbying reform because they take corruption for granted and it wo n't especially hurt republicans ( or benefit democrats ) this fall . according to this view americans think congress is rotten to the core except when it comes to their own representative who they consider a fine upstanding person . the phenomenon is roughly analogous to what americans think about education -- the system is terrible except their own schools which are fairly good .

<s> earmarks foster a selfish `` bring-home-the-pork '' mentality <eos>
