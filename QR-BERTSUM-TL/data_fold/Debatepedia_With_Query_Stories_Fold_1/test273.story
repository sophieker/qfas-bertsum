<s> crisis : which is the greater crises poverty or climate change ? <eos>

<s> the global south is a body of people living in abject poverty mostly near the equator and in the northern hemisphere . global warming threatens to drastically reduce rain fall in these areas of the world which would have a devastating effect on water resource crop production and general economic productivity in these regions . the worst effects of sea-level rising are also likely to occur in low lying coastal areas of greatest concern in densely populated south east asia india bangladesh and parts of africa . overall thus climate change is one of the greatest threats to global poverty . <eos>

@highlight

<s> climate changing will disproportionately harm poorest force . <eos>
