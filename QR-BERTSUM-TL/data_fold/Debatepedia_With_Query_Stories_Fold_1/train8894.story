<s> torture : are enhanced interrogations techniques legal or are they torture ? <eos>

<s> the bush administration told the cia in # that its interrogators working abroad would not violate us prohibition against torture unless they `` have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering '' according to a previously secret us justice department memo released on # july # . the interrogator 's `` good faith '' and `` honest belief '' that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator the memo adds . `` because specific intent is an element of the offense the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture '' chris meehan then the assistant attorney general wrote in the memo . <eos>

@highlight

<s> interrogations are not torture when no intention to torture . <eos>
