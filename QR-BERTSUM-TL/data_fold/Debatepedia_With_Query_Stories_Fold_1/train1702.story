<s> doctors : does a public insurance option favor doctors/hospitals ? <eos>

<s> it is surprising that the american medical association would complain about over forty million americans suddenly having insurance so that they can pay doctors and hospitals for health care services . this is certainly a good thing for the health care industry overall ( doctors in particular ) despite possibly being a less than advantageous opportunity for the private health insurance industry . so what 's the problem ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> public insurance will give doctors/hospitals millions of new patients . <eos>
