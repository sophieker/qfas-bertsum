<s> general history : are tibet 's general historical claims to independence justified ? <eos>

<s> many countries have close ties and even assist one another militarily . but this does not equate to a history of sovereign control . `` tibet and china : two distinctive views '' . rangzen.org . retrieved # . # . # - `` during the manchu rules ( # - # ) the qing army was asked by tibetans to settle disputes . but this does not support china 's right to tibet . if it did then the u.s.a. should claim kuwait and haiti since it assisted these countries . in fact on a number of occasions tibet exercised power over china suggests that perhaps tibet should claim china ! '' <eos>

<s> a history of close-ties and military aid does not equating to korean sovereignty . <eos>
