<s> pakistan government : could the pakistani government tolerate a unilateral us strike ? <eos>

<s> this is particularly true if pakistan feels it is in dangers of losing nuclear weapons to terrorist hands . in such an instance as long as the united states actions clearly aligned with pakistan 's interests a unilateral action would be tolerated or possibly even welcomed after words by the pakistani government . of course it depends largely on the nature of the unilateral action and the calculus that a certain unilateral attack would align strongly with pakistan 's interests . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the pakistani government may allow for unilateral we strikes if musharaff feels incapable of solving the terrorist threat . <eos>
