<s> reliability : can health insurance co-ops be relied on ? are they well tested ? <eos>

<s> `` health care co-op supporters do n't know what they 're talking about '' . huffington post . june 18 2009 : `` as it turns out [ faith in health insurance co-ops ] comes from a lot of examples that do n't have anything to do with health care even remotely ! as pretty cnn hologram jessica yellin explained to birther fanatic lou dobbs health care co-ops proponent senator kent conrad was specifically inspired by an entirely different kind of co-op . [ ... ] kent conrad is under the impression that electricity and health care are distributed in the same manner [ as health insurance ] ? that 's sort of dubious ! '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> co-ops will not necessarily work in health insurance <eos>
