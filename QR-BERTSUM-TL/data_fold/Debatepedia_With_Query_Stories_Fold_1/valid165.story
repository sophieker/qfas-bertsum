<s> religious philosophy : are religious philosophies generally harmful or beneficial in society ? <eos>

<s> the bible itself denounces laziness especially in proverbs and also paul says `` if a man shall not work he shall not eat . '' true not all theists are amazingly hard working but the same can be said of atheists also . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people who believe in god do not do so because they want to be lazy . <eos>
