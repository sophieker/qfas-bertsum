<s> democracy : is seating the delegates required in preserving democracy ? <eos>

<s> valid elections require that certain democratic standards be upheld . one of these standards is that the rules are clear from the beginning . an election in which the candidates and voters are led to believe wo n't count but that is later changed to count violates this basic rule . similarly the most basic election standards demand that the candidates are all quite and equally represented on their respective ballots . michigan 's primary violated this principle in that obama 's name did not appearing on the ballots while hilary 's did . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the michigan and orlando elections were not valid and the results should not be used <eos>
