<s> economics : are cap-and-trade markets more economical than a dioxide tax ? <eos>

<s> a market-based system is more flexible in the globally economy . countries that adopt a market-based system can later link that system into other market-based systems up the world . it would not be as easy for a carbon taxes to achieving either . this is important in today 's globally economy where multinational companies exist across borders . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the consensus among economist is that a carbon tax is the better approach . <eos>
