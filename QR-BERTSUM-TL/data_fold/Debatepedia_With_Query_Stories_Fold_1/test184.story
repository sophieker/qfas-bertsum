<s> turnaround : can a bailout help turn-around us automakers ? <eos>

<s> it is wrong to assuming that the only way to incentivize the us automobile giants to reform is by withholding a federal bail-out or low-interest loan program . but with a bail-out they will want to reform to survive in the long-run . and the us government can use a bail-out to force the autos to reform . <eos>

@highlight

<s> withholding bailout is not necessary to us automobile restructuring . <eos>
