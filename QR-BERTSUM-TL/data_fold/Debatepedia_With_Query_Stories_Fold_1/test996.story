<s> prolonged existence of the building is insane <eos>

<s> ok we have internet but it 's a decent building well crafted . long corridors very well suited for bookshelves . why not fill it with literature ? 'it 's too connected with wars ' - well just think four-dimensionally . reagan had a good reason why he liked that movie . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the building could serve well as a library . <eos>
