<s> position : what is obama 's position ? has it been constant or shifted ? <eos>

<s> john mccain and the republican 's position against obama 's position on meeting with foreign leaders relies almost completely on the shallow premise that obama has `` changed positions '' . this has nothing to do with the principle of the matter of meeting with hostile foreign leaders for which mccain presents no serious opposing cases based on principled arguments . <eos>

@highlight

<s> mccain has no case against meeting hostile leaders ; relies on obama 's `` changing positions '' . <eos>
