<s> distinct identity : does tibetan have a distinct regional identity ? <eos>

<s> even if tibet has certain unique distinctions over most of these other minority groups it is unclear why this should warrant their independence . if we offer independence to tibet on the basis of these distinctions are n't we inflate the significance of differences in the world . is n't this contrary to the principles of tolerance multiculturalism and compassion espoused throughout the moder world and particularly by the dalai lama . if compassion is central to buddhist philosophies should n't these differences be minimized ? indeed tibet 's pursuit of independence has inflamed pro-tibet/anti-chinese and pro-china/anti-tibet feelings and voices around the world . the pursuit of independence creates damaging battle lines and lasting prejudices in this way . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tibetans should not accentuate differences and create biases pursuing independence . <eos>
