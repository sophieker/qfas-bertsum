<s> kosovo viability : would an independent kosovo be a feasible state ? <eos>

<s> pat cox former vice of the european parliament argued on # / # / # that `` kosovo has nowhere left to go other than independence . returning to a state relationship with serbia is anathema to the # minimum cent of the population that is ethnic albanian and forcing such a solution would reignite war . any vassal option would be seen by kosovo albanians as merely the buying of time at their expense . and there are no viable candidate organisations to take on the role : the un 's politics capital in kosovo is exhausted after its five years of inadequate stop-gap administration and the ta is not geared or willing to take over kosovo 's governance . '' <eos>
