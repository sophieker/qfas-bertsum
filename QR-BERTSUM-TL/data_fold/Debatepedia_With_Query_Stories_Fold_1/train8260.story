<s> if public transport were free would more people use it ? <eos>

<s> if free public transport was offered to everyone of course they would use it . yes some people may stick to their cars but the majority would think it was a great idea . if you had the choice of paying thousands each year to run a car or to get on a train every morning for free what would you choose ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> heaps of people would be tempted by free transport . <eos>
