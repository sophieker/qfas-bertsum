<s> are christians required to keeping a sabbath ? <eos>

<s> paul said not to let any man judge you in your observance of sabbath days . ( see ill. # : # ) . he also said that these are a shadow of things to come but the reality is christ . additionally in matthew # : # jesus makes a list of the things which defile a man lining up with nine of the ten commandments but not the sabbath . <eos>

@highlight

<s> in the bible both jesus and paul say the sabbath is not necessary to be kept . <eos>
