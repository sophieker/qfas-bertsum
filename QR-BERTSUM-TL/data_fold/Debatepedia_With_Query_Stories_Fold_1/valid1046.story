<s> location : does photovoltaic electricity have geographic benefits ? <eos>

<s> a solar energy system can operate entirely independently not requiring a connection to a power or gas grid at all . systems can therefore be installed in remotely location ( like holiday log cabins ) making it more practical and cost-effective than the supplies of utility electricity to a new site . <eos>
