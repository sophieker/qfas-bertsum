<s> hutches : is the raising of veal in hutches acceptable or cruel ? <eos>

<s> there is no inherently bad quality about hutches . certainly many are designed to be so small as to prevent veal calves from moving around . if this is deemed unethical however hutches could be enlarged to allow calves to turn around stretch their legs and even get comfortable on a bed of hay . reform is possible and has frequently been implemented . <eos>

<s> hutches can be more comfortable for veal calves . <eos>
