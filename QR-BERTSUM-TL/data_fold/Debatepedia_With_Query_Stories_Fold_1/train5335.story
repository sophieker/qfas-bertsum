<s> human survival : is colonization of the moon critical to human survival ? <eos>

<s> global warming is the predominant threat to humanity at present . fighting it should be the focus of our efforts . in so far as a moonbase distracts and diverts resources from this effort it does a disservice to our long-term survival . <eos>

@highlight

<s> human survival is ensured by fighting global warming not moonbase . <eos>
