<s> we hunt and eat animals ... is testing justification by our been hunting and eating animals ? <eos>

<s> it is not a justification for animal testing that some beings eat and hunt animals . a tenant of the animal rights community is that any form of harm to animals is wrong usually if it can be easily avoided with reasonable substitutes . it is therefore which not appropriate to say that `` the eating and hunting of animals goes no much public outcry so why alienate animal testing ? '' the truths is that the eating and hunting of animals is met by substantial protests by animal rights activists . again hunting and meat consumption do not provide cover for animal testing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> eating and hunt of animals does not justify testing ; equally wrong <eos>
