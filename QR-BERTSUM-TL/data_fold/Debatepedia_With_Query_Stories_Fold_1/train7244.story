<s> [ # ] `` despite its grand commitment to end threats to human security such as interstate war genocide famine internal war diseases and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the u.n. has been surprisingly unsuccessful at achieving these ends . genocides in cambodia rwanda the former serbia and most recently sudan have continued relentlessly despite the most fervent attempts of the u.n. to cajole its member state to act . the u.n. has not stopped north korea 's attempts at create a reactors arsenal nor has it prevented india and pakistan from testing their own reactors weapons . iran 's holocaust-denying president is well on his ways to develop fissionable material regardless of their referral to the u.n. 's international atomic energy agency . '' <eos>
