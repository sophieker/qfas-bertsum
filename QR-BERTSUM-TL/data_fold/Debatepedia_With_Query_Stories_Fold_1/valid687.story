<s> war on terror : is it wrong to know the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> most iraqis oppose the us occupation of iraq some to the extent that they are willing to support the cause of the insurgency . and as short as el qaeda frames its mission in iraq as part of this anti-occupation effort they are largely welcome . but if foreign troops leave el qaeda will not longer have a cause to justify its presence and they will lose the support they enjoy from iraqis . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a us troop presence in iraq provides terrorists with a justified for their presence among iraqis . <eos>
