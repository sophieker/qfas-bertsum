<s> rights : do corps generally eligible for personhood/rights ? <eos>

<s> corporations have a 'legal personality ' for the purpose of conducting business while shielding individual stockholders from personal liability ( i.e . protecting personal assets which were not invested in the corporation ) . without such protection corporations would face significantly more challenging barriers to markets entries and survival which effectively narrows the scope of competition in the marketplace . less competition in the marketplace comes at the cost of the consumer who will have to select from a wider various of choices . <eos>

@highlight

<s> corporate liberties protect owners from liability . <eos>
