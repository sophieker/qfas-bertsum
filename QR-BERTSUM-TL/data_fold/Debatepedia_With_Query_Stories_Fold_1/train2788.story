<s> creationism as science : does creationism qualify as science ? <eos>

<s> - while creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a theory this is not exactly the case . observations that evolution does occur in nature makes the process of evolution fact . the only part of evolution that is `` theory '' is the explanation as to `` why '' it occurs . but the `` why '' has nothing to do with the simple fact that it does occur a fact that leaves no room for creationism . <eos>

@highlight

<s> evolution is an observable fact <eos>
