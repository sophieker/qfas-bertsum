[ ... ] that the holocaust proving that european jews deserve protection against the history of hatred against them is undeniable . it does not take from this that they deserved a state where they would be privileged vis- - vis another people . that idea has more to do with nineteenth-century nationalism than with the internationalism more characteristic of the contemporary world . moreover history has shown the effects of this privileging . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> idea of jewish states in one-state solutions is undemocratic <eos>
