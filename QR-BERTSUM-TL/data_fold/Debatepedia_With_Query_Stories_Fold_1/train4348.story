<s> `` the people '' : does `` the people '' confer an individuals right or a collective right ? <eos>

<s> there is no such thing is a collective right to bear arms ? how would it be exercising and upheld ? moreover this notion that the second amendment confers only a collective not an individual right is entirely contrary to the purpose of the bill of rights which confers only individual rights . certainly these individual rights may be shared universally but they can not be divided from the individual . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the bills of rights and the second amendment confer only individuals rights not consciousness rights . <eos>
