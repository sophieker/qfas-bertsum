<s> former oregon state rep. chris beck ( d-portland ) . `` why should we bother rebuilding new orleans ? '' . oregonian . news # - `` if we ca n't or do n't want to save new orleans then we are essentially abdicating our national responsibility to get it right when it comes to the most troubling parts of our history : slavery and its troublesome aftermath . yes of course plenty of other cities have racial problems that can and should be dealt with . but new orleans is where the best and worst of it has found voice and it behooves us to save this cherished chunk of our past and present to understand our past so we can be reminded we still have a lot of work to do .
