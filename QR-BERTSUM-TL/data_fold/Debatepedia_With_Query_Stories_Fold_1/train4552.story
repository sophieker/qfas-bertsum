<s> war on christmas : is `` happy holidays '' part of a `` war on christmas '' ? <eos>

<s> many have framed this debate as if the people encouraging the use of happy holidays or seasons greetings are trying to secularize christmas . this is an improper formation of the debate . googling `` keep christ out of christmas '' finds virtually no websites dedicated to `` secularizing christmas . '' however `` keep christ in christmas '' results in thousands of web pages with many advocacy groups . some of these groups call for a boycott of retailers who are using the more inclusive greeting of `` happy holidays '' rather than `` merry christmas . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` happy holidays '' advocates are not against christmas . <eos>
