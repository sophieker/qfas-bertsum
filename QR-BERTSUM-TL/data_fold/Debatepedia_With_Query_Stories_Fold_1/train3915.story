<s> rights : does government have a right to ban wearing the hijab ? <eos>

<s> if the government bans the wearing of head scarves in public places what can possibly prevent private institutions from doing the exact same ? the answer is nothing . indeed in france where public bans have been in effect many private companies or organizations have implemented bans on the wearing of hijabs . in other words governments bans have created a slippery slope to widespread discrimination . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public bans on head scarves encourage private bans <eos>
