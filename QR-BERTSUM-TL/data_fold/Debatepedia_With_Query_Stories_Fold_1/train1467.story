<s> rules : do the rules allow for seating delegates after they 've been stripped ? <eos>

<s> changing the rules to allow for the seating of florida and michigan delegates will undoubtedly benefit one of the candidates . which candidate benefits depends on what course of action is taken . but this does not matter . if a change in policy will negatively affect any one candidate than no action should be taken . <eos>

@highlight

<s> changing the rules mid-game is sure to disadvantage one candidate <eos>
