<s> feasibility : is a market-based market-based system more feasible than a carbon tax ? <eos>

<s> in a carbon tax emitters would pay a tax for each ton of carbon emitted . this requires that the government know precisely how much carbon is being emitted by electricity producers . this is not easy to determine and requires that a government put in place monitoring mechanisms . deploying these mechanisms universally would be very complicated expensive and require much administration . then ensuring that all these monitoring devices operate correctly and that all electricity producers comply with the tax would also involves a substantial administrative burden . this would be equally as complicated as a cap-and-trade system . however part of the monitoring cost could be absorbed privately by firms who wish to sell their credits as high price is in their interest . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a dioxide tax would also requiring complicated monitor and enforcement mechanisms . <eos>
