<s> economics : is algae biofuel economically viable ? <eos>

<s> `` algae biofuel mania '' . stockhouse . 11 june 2008 - `` i might point out that some of the more vociferous algae pimps are suggesting that algae need merely be introduced into a properly designed water filled bioreactor and the organisms will multiply until the unit is packed to overflowing with tons upon tons of green biomass all in the space of days . this is patent nonsense . algae can grow quickly but only in the presence of sufficient nutrients . just like any other organism algae require carbon nitrogen phosphorus and various other minerals .
