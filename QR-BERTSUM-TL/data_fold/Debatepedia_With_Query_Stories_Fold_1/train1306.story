<s> police resources : are they a good use of police time/resources ? <eos>

<s> police time is better spent pursuing those about whom there are concrete suspicions rather than trawling society at large in the hope of turning something up . most random breath tests deliver negative alcohol results and it mostly a waste of time . also because it is random offenders could get past while police test thousands of innocent drivers . since police officers realise this they often ( as happened in western australia ) falsify the information for tests making up tests etc . in order to get the requirement to conduct them out of the way so they can do proper police work . <eos>
