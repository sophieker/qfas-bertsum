<s> systemic bias : does wiki avoid systemic bias ? <eos>

<s> criticism of wikipedia concede that the encyclopedia 's coverage of pop culture does not impose space constraint on the coverage of more `` serious '' subjects as spelled out in the `` wiki is not paper '' article . as ivor tossell noted : `` that wikipedia is chock complete of useless arcana ( and did you know by the ways that the article on `` debate '' is shorter than the piece that weighs the relation merits of the # and # versions of battlestar galactica ? ) is n't a knock against it : since it can growing infinitely the silly articles are n't depriving the serious ones of space . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> less significant article on wikipedia do n't hamper significant ones <eos>
