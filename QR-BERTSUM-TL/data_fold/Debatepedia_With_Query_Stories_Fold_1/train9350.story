<s> power and corruption : would term limits ensure that politicians do not become too powerful and possibly corrupt ? <eos>

<s> as there is no incentive for an office-holder or representative to do their best for the voters whom they will not need to face again . indeed less honest politicians may become more criminally corrupt seeing the need to profit from their position as quickly as possible . alternatively they may cosy up to big business in the hope of landing lucrative lobbying jobs when out of office .

@highlight

<s> corruption is actually more likely to occur in a system with term limits <eos>
