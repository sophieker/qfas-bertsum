<s> recycling co # is likely to offer the most environmentally and financially sustainability response to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary ( industrial ) emitters in the near to medium-sized term . [ citation needed ] this is because newly developed technologies such as bio ccs algal synthesis value captured pre-smokestack co # ( such as from a coal fired power station for example ) as a helpful feedstock input to the production of oil-rich algae in solar membranes to produce oil for plastics and transport fuel ( including aircraft fuel ) and nutritious stockfeed for farms animal production . the co # and other captured greenhouse gases are injected into the membranes contain waste water and select strains of algae causing together with sunlight or uv light <eos>
