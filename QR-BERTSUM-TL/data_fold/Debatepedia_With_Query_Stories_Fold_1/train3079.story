<s> dominion : do humans not have dominion over animal ( and a right to eat them ) ? <eos>

<s> the notion of man 's dominion over animals need not be think of as a blank check for man to exploit animals . indeed it may be appropriate to connect the notion of `` dominion '' to stewardship '' over animals . yet beings can be great stewards of animals while continuing to eat them . it is merely required that beings maintain balance ordering and sustainability in the animal kingdom . but again this does not require the abandonment of meat-eating . <eos>

@highlight

<s> kingdom and meat-eating can and should be excercised responsibly . <eos>
