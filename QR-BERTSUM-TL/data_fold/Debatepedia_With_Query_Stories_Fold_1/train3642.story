<s> beauty : ok to emphasize beauty in society in contests ? <eos>

<s> beauty contests promote an ideal of female beauty to which only a minority of women can realistically aspire but which adds to the pressure on all women to conform to it . this can be harmful to women by encouraging dieting eating disorders and cosmetic surgery or simply by making them feel inadequate and ugly . moreover these contests force the models to look even slimmer and perfect all the time thus encouraging anorexia and bulimia . <eos>

<s> beauty contests put undue pressure on being beautiful . <eos>
