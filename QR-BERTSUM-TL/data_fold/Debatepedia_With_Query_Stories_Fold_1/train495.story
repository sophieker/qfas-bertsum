<s> individual representation : are children unable to sufficiently represent their interests in performing ? <eos>

<s> this leaves them at risk of exploitation in the workplace . while parents can represent their children s interests to their employers but there is always a danger that parent s interests do not align with their children s. discrepancies in interests can arise when the child s earning power far outstrips that of the parent or the activity fulfils the ambitions of the parent more than the child s.

<s> children are less able to make decisions for themselves and to represent their interests . <eos>
