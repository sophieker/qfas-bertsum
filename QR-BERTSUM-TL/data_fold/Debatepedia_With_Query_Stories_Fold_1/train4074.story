<s> politics : is it good not to intervene ? <eos>

<s> and not wait for genocide to happen . genocides are inevitably preceded by incitement to genocide . these incitements occur months and years before the genocide occurs . for instance the incitement to genocide for which garcia mugesera was ordered deported from canada occurred in november # . the genocide did not begin till april # over fifteen months later . if mugesera and others like him had been prosecuted at the time the genocide could have been prevented without use of arms .
