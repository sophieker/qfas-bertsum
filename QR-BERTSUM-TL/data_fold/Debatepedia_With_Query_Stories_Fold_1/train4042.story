<s> the surge : was the `` surge '' not definitely a `` success '' ? <eos>

<s> peter jeff scott . `` why the u.s. must withdraw from iraq '' . salon.com . oct. # # - `` in retrospect we can see that it was precisely the early u.s. successes in thailand that mislead america into an no-win hot war [ in vietnam ] . '' this point can be extended as a warning against attaching too much meaning to the `` success '' of the surge ; it may serve only to protract the war without any actual prospects for success . <eos>

@highlight

<s> limited `` success '' of surge only feeds false hopes in iraq <eos>
