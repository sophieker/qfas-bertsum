<s> vs tobacco/alcohol : is trans fat ban like bans alcohol/tobacco ? <eos>

<s> opponents of banning trans fats frequently comparison the thought with that of banning alcoholic or tobacco . you ca n't ban trans fats if you 're not willing to also ban cigarettes and alcoholic they say . but this misses a keys difference . while banning cigarette and alcoholic mean banning an entire product category banning the ingredient of trans fats means no such thing . rather it simply means that readily available replacements ingredients must be used in the preparation of the same foods . and since these fatty replacements are widespread and cheaply available food makers and consumers should have bit difficulty making the adjustment to making and consuming the same albeit slightly modified foods . <eos>

<s> trans fat ingredients has replacements unlike tobacco/alcohol . <eos>
