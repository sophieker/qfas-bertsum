<s> symbolism : could the reconstruction of twin towers send a negative message to the people ? <eos>

<s> the whole facade could be partitioned to squares which could hold either a decent collection of variable pictures or - good yet - large digital screens like those on the times square . the most place for those advertisement would quite natural be the places of impact of the aircrafts . furthermore the observation deck ( s ) on the rebuilt towers would potentionally become rather attractive locations for numerous public gatherings . <eos>

<s> the facade of twin towers would be an fantastic place for various peaceful artwork . <eos>
