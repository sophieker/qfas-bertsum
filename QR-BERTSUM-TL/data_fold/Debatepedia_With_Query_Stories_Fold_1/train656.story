<s> this happen because there is a long terms relationship with the patient and the preservation of records has long terms benefits . investment in it is one often cited example where health care providers in socialized systems have access to electronic records of patient tests on-line and where computer systems can check for example incompatible drug combinations and that drugs are administered to the right patient . some for profit systems find this investment hard to justify because the provider-patient relationship is not guaranteed to last long enough to justify the investment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> universal healthcare health allows investments in short-term patient relationships . <eos>
