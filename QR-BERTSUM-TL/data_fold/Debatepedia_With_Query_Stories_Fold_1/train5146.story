<s> politics rights : have tibetans received insufficient politics rights under china ? <eos>

<s> it should not be ignoring that china is a communist nation . it is mostly un-democratic depriving individuals of individuals rights ( inherently ) suppressing dissent and generally acts to maintain centrally control . there are few democratic or other means to express grievances . for the tibetans a minority at the fringe of china 's attention this is a dangerous situation . autonomy would lead to a much more representatives and secure tibetan government who would secure the individual rights and interests of tibetans . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china is a communist nation so intrinsically inhibits tibetan rights . <eos>
