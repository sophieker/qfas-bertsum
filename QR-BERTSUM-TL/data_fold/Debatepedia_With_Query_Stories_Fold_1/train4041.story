<s> prospective politicians : do negative ads turn off prospective politicians from engaging in politics ? <eos>

<s> it s just part of the game . the poor dears do seek publicity after all they should accept the inevitable downside of people having negative opinions about them . we should want our politicians to be tough : how much faith would we have if we sent softies to represent our nation s interests at international summits or stand up for the needs of voters in the legislature ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> politics is a tough game and those that go into it should expect that : <eos>
