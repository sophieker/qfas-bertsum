<s> management : have the huge four been grossly mismanaged ? <eos>

<s> kate mcleod . `` help detroit ! '' . wow o wow . # dec. # - `` they didn t build green cars `` you say ? well we wanted pickups and suvs . it just so happens that we liked pickups and suvs and they are still the best-selling vehicles . sure detroit should have built better-looking better-performing and better-quality cars but how can we blame them for selling us what we wanted ? by the way today s detroit cars are pretty good from the ford mustang to the chevy malibu to the chrysler vehicle still the best-selling vehicle in the world . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us automobiles did n't build green cars because americans would n't purchase them <eos>
