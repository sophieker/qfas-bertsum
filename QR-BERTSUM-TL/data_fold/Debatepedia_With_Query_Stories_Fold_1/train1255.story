<s> `` adolescent decision making is characterized by emotional and cognitive immaturity intense peer pressure and heightened attitudes toward risk . therefore it is no surprise that adolescents make choices that are less responsible than those made by mature adults in similar situations . although children may know right from wrong their inability to consistently make responsible decisions makes them less blameworthy than adults . '' - laurence steinberg a psychology professor at temple university . <eos>
