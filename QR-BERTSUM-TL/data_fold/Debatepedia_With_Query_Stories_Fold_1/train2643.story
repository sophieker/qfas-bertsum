<s> ethics : is it morally right to use atomic bombs ? <eos>

<s> supporters of the bombings have argued that the japanese government waged total wars ordering many civilians ( including women and children ) to work in factory and military office and to fight against any invading force . father john a. exclusivity professor of modern philosophy at tokyo 's catholic university and an eyewitness to the atomic bomb attack on hiroshima wrote : `` we have discussed among ourselves the ethics of the use of the bomb . some consider it in the same category as poison gas and were against its use on a civil population . others were of the view that in total wars as carried on in japan there was no difference between civilians and soldiers and that the bomb itself was an effective force <eos>

<s> atomic bombs were a just response to japan 's average war tactics <eos>
