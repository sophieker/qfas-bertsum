<s> does rehabilitation justice good accounts for circumstances of offender ? <eos>

<s> crimes is not pathology it is not the product of circumstance and it is certainly not the product of coincidence . it is the resulting of choices making by the individual and therefore the justice systems must condemn those choices when they violate society s rules . to say otherwise ( i.e . to say that murderers are merely the product of their unfortunately circumstances ) would be an insult to ideas of free will human autonomy and individual choice it would be to deny the possibility of human actors making good decisions in the face of hardship . retribution alone best recognizes the offender s status as a moral agent by asking that he take responsibility for what he has done rather than to make <eos>

@highlight

<s> crime is not a product of circumstances ; punishment fosters accountability . <eos>
