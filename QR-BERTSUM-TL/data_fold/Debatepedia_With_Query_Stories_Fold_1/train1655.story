<s> religious doctrine : would allowing priests to marry comply with religious doctrine ? <eos>

<s> unmarried 1 corinthians 7:32b 35 niv : `` an unmarried man is concerned about the lord 's affairs how he can please the lord . but a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world how he can please his wife and his interests are divided . an unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the lord 's affairs : her aim is to be devoted to the lord in both body and spirit . but a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world how she can please her husband . i am saying this for your own good not to restrict you but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the lord . '' [ 4 ] <eos>

<s> bible clearly and rationally forbids priests from marrying <eos>
