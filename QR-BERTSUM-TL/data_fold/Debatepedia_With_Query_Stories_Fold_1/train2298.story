<s> usage : does war on drug reducing usage ? <eos>

<s> `` how to stop the drug wars . '' the economist . mar # th # : `` fear [ of legalisation ] is basis in large part on the presumptions that more people would take drugs under a legal regime . that presumptions may be wrong . there is no correlation between the harshness of drug laws and the incidence of drug-taking : citizens living under tough regimes ( notably america but also britain ) take more drugs not fewer . ashamed drug warriors blame this on alleged culture differences but but in fairly similar countries tough rules make little difference to the number of addicts : harsh sweden and more liberal norway have precisely the same addiction rates . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> drug prohibition does not correlated with decreased using <eos>
