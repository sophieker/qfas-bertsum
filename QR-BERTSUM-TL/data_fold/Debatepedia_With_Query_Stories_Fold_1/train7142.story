<s> vs imf : is an emf necessary beyond role of international monetary fund ? <eos>

<s> despite the fact that the imf is ( in the eu ) seen as `` washington '' the truth is that the imf is an international body `` crammed with clever economists and technocrats from around the world . '' according to the charlemagne column of the economist . [ 5 ] therefore at the time of crisis it is rather sensible to call for such an organization . <eos>

@highlight

<s> calling imf is not humiliating but sensible during crisis . <eos>
