<s> commitment : do people exaggerate the importance of commitment in marriage ? <eos>

<s> modern expectations of a perfect marriage are unrealistic and have been fostered by the entertainment industry s concept of an ideal relationship . people should not go into marriage expecting perfection ; nor should they think of marriage as based solely on romantic love . marriage is both a union based on love and a practical partnership that like all relationships has ups and downs and needs to be worked at to make it succeed . as such it is right that a reason should be provided for a divorce to be granted to prevent an over-hasty dissolution of a marriage that might have lasted if it had been worked at . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marriage is about union and love both of which are hard to fulfill and need to be continually worked on <eos>
