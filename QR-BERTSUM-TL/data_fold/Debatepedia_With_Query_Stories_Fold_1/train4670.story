<s> health care : which candidate 's health care plan is superior ? <eos>

<s> hillary 's healthcare care plan mandates that all uninsured citizens buy healthcare care . those can not afford to do so and so wo n't . the problems surrounds what you do at that stage . do you then as obama critically asks punish these individuals by for example garnishing their wages ? this would be highly divisive as it is in massachusetts and unpolitical . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hillary 's healthcare care plan has enforceable apolitical mandates . <eos>
