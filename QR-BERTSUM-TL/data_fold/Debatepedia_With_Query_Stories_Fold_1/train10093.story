<s> bans categories : is it ok to bans whole categories of arms such as handguns in dc ? <eos>

<s> america states courts of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . march # th # courts decision against the washington handgun ban . - `` once it is determine - as we have done - that handguns are 'arms ' referred to in the third amendment it is not open to the district to ban them ... that is not to suggest that the government is absolutely barred from regulating the using and ownership of pistols . the protections of the third amendment are subject to the same kind of reasonable restrictions that have been recognized as limiting for instance the first amendment . '' <eos>
