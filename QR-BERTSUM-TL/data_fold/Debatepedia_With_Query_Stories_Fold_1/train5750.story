<s> cuban harms : do sanctions significantly harm cubans ? <eos>

<s> in the # s cuba lost $ # bn in trade and $ # . # bn in international loans because of u.s. sanctions . cuba is too poor a country not to suffer from these losses . the dominance of america in the pharmaceuticals industry moreover means that it is actually impossible for cubans to gain access to many drugs . america would be the natural market for most cuban products and its refusal to accept goods with even the tiniest cuban inputs from third nations damages cuba s ability to trade with others . other south american countries have shown their reliance on the types of loans that cuba is denied in the last few years to keep their economies on track .
