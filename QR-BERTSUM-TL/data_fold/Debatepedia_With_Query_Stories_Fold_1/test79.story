<s> science : is a new moon landed better for scientific research ? <eos>

<s> in the scope of studies and the gathering of information beings have only barely begun to actually studies the moon from a scientific perspective . if you are going to do some sort of studies or studies the moon is obviously the more logical thing to do is studies the moon because it is too closer and would allow for the easiest safer and quickest method of transport of human beings as well as scientific data and evidence because of it 's proximity to the earth . many things on planet earth are influenced by the moon and having us physically studied it so little it only seems proper and logical to deal with the moon first and mars later . <eos>

<s> there is too more to be discovered 2/14/05 the moon <eos>
