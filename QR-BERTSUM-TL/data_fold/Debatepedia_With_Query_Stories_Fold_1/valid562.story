'' merced sun star . december # th # : `` the argument that not building this train system would mean building more highways and more runways does n't hold water either . if we 're going to have to build one or the other why not build the one which gives us the better options namely more highways and runways ? lanes can be added to existing highways and more runways added to existing airports more easily than overcoming the logistical nightmare of # miles of high-speed rail cutting through the heart of california .
