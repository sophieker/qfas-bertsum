<s> turnaround : can a bailout helping turnaround us automakers ? <eos>

<s> bill steigerwald . `` do n't bail out the big three '' . town hall . # nov. # - `` a one of the examples i 'm hearing from proponents of the previous bailout is `` let 's go back to # when chrysler was bailed out . that was a success story . chrysler came out of insolvency and paid back the u.s. taxpayer with interest after four years . '' but to me the fact that the government approached in back then has been an enabling implicit guarantee for the big three ever since . had chrysler gone under back then i am convinced that the unions would not have had as too power as they had during the # s because they would have been dealing with two companies instead of three . <eos>
