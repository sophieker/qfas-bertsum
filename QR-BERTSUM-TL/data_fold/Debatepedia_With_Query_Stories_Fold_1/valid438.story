<s> self-defense - is self-defense a good reason for guns ownership ? <eos>

<s> the supreme court case warren vs district of columbia maitained that there is no way to police protection and that there is no contracts between the individuals and local police . in short the court has ruled that each person is responsible for his/her own protection . <eos>

@highlight

<s> individuals are responsible to defending themselves as cops are not . <eos>
