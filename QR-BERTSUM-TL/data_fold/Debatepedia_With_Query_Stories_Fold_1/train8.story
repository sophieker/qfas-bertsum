<s> revenue : do progressive taxes generate more tax revenue than flat taxes ? <eos>

<s> james a. dorn . `` ending tax socialism '' . cato institute . # sept. # - `` one major benefit of a flat-rate tax is that it would make the cost of government expansion visible to all taxpayers especially if combined with a balanced-budget amendment . there would be a built-in incentive to compare the costs and benefits of new government programs . the invisible hand of the democratic process would then work more judiciously to determine the size of government . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> progressive tax rates hide size and growth of government <eos>
