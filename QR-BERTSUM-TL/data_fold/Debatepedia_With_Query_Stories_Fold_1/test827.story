'' the energy collective . september # # : `` unfortunately with the demise of climate legislation the u.s. ccs industry now faces a difficult uphill battle . the reason for this is simple . ccs technologies add large capital costs to plant building and ccs retrofits to existing plants are almost as costly as building a plant from scratch . in addition to the equipment and technology requirements the ccs process itself reduces a power plant s efficiency by roughly # % which amounts to a substantial decline in revenue for the plant owner . therefore no a substantial price on carbon it doesn t making economic sense for a coal or natural gas producer <eos>
