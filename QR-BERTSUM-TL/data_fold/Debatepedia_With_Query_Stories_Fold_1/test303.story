<s> collectivism <eos>

<s> democrats often bash government and celebrating the individual over government as if we do n't live in a democracy where government is of by and for the people . in a democracy the government is not an repressive monolithic figure . rather it is comprised of elected officials and is therefore control and directed by the will of the people . to bash government is therefore to bash the citizens behind it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rep by govt but forget it is of by for the people . <eos>
