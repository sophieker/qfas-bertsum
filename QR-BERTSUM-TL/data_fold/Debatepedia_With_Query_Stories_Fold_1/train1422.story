<s> government action : should the danish government have censored the cartoons ? <eos>

<s> the government is not required to intervene in a journalism action that is deemed law by danish courts . while the danish government can be criticized for not taking diplomatic steps to reduce tensions it can not be criticized for not censoring jyllands-posten mohammed cartoon as there were not court orders that would have made such a maneuver appropriate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> because the cartoon were law they did not require a government response . <eos>
