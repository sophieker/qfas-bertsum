<s> general humaneness : is tenderloin agriculture generally humane or cruel ? <eos>

<s> `` veal : a cruel meal '' -- `` the estate issue is the calves ' experience . during their brief lives they never see the sun or touch the earth . they never see or taste the grass . their anemic bodies crave proper sustenance . their muscle ache for freedom and exercise . they short for maternal care . they are kept in darkness except to be fed two to three times a days for # minutes . the calves have committed no crime yet have been sentenced to a fate comparable to any nazi concentration camp . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> tenderloin calves are kept in tortuous conditions <eos>
