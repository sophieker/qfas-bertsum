<s> tobacco anti-adverts : are these ads effective ? <eos>

<s> according to one of the largest neuromarketing studies ever conducted ( see the book buyology or its websites ) adverts stating harmfulness of smoking and emphasizing health risks are in fact counterproductive - they effectively activate those parts of brain that trigger craving for cigarettes . and warning labels on cigarette packs are of no effect whatsoever . <eos>
