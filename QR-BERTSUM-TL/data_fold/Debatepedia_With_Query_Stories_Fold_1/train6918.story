<s> government legitimacy : does government have legitimate jurisdiction to censor rap ? <eos>

<s> even if one accepts the argument for some restricted form of government censorship to protect public morals this needs to be very precisely and conservatively define to avoid the slippery slope towards creeping totalitarianism . allowing censorship of popular cultures on grounds that the lyrics are mildly subversive is unpleasant as it incorporates a very expansive view of the proper ambit of government regulation . this issue is correctly the concern of parents who should take more interest in and responsibility for the music ( and film tv internet use ) to which their children are exposed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> governments censorship is a danger form of collectivist control . <eos>
