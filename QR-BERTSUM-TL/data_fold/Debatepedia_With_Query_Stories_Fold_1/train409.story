<s> family violence : does arrangement marriages result in more abuse and marital violence ? <eos>

<s> the institution of marriage always creates interdependence and therefore scope for abused and danger and the police and outsiders always find it more difficult to intervene where violence is throughout a marriage . this is a criticism of marriage per se and not arrangement and we can t ban marriage . the vulnerability of those without language skills is an accepted fact of immigrants policy again it applies to all immigrants and not to arranged marriages . finally most marriage organisers are actually women as in the auntie system in india . they gain prestige and authority through their role . this doesn t seem to oppress women . what you are really saying is that islamic societies are patriarchy and that muslims have arranged marriages . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arranged marriage in europe and north american have idiosyncratically low levels of abused and marital violence . <eos>
