<s> warming trend : is there a clear warming trend that shows human finger-prints ? <eos>

<s> during this period co # warming was overtaken by an increase in human particulates and aerosol pollution . but as pollution regulations and technology improved sulphate aerosol concentrations decreased human-c # 's warming effect re-emerged and global warming continued apace . this `` global dimming '' effect does not negate the fact that the general trend is human-caused global warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cooling between # and # can be attributed to sulphate aerosols <eos>
