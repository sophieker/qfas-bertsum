<s> georgian governance : has georgia inadequately governed s. ossetia ? <eos>

<s> georgia has been absent in s. ossetia . yet this is not the will of the georgian government but the result of s. ossetian separatism . if georgia was given a chance to govern s. ossetia it would do so very well . <eos>

@highlight

<s> georgia can not be blamed for its absence in s. ossetia . <eos>
