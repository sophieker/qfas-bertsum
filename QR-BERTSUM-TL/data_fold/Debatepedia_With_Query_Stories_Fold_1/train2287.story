<s> religion : is the ban tolerant/respectful of the muslim faith ? <eos>

<s> because this is only a bans in french private building muslims are free to wearing the hijab anywhere else . because there is such a low muslim out-migration and the hijab is allowed in most places it 's really not very hard just to abide by the french laws that have been in places for over a decade . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the bans only applicable in private buildings . <eos>
