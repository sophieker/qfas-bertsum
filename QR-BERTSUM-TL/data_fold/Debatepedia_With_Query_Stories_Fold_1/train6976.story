<s> poverty : does progressive tax helping the poor ? <eos>

<s> andrew sullivan . `` 'progressive ' taxation '' . the daily dish the atlantic . # jun # - `` government 's secondary concern is to raise money as efficiently and as leanly and as equally as possible . i 'm happy with the government then settings up programs to assist the bad to provide better education for those at the bottom safety-net health-care and better policing . i.e . to gear spending toward social ends that might help the bad the most . these are measurable practical goods . what i 'm not happy with is the assumption that tax policy should really be about redistributing wealth and engineering substantive economic outcomes . yes of course at lower income levels a # percent flat income tax will be more onerous proportionally than at higher incomes . <eos>

<s> other means than tax policy should be used to helping the poor <eos>
