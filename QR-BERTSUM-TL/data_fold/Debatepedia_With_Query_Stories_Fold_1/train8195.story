<s> global warming : can iron fertilization help considerably combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> all the central solutions to global warming entail cutting greenhouse gas emission from future energy production . but this does not reduce the amount of c # currently in the surroundings nor does it promise to end c # emission any when soon . and but global warming is occurring now from the existing quantities of c # in the atmosphere . in other words all plans to cut future emission will not help actually reverse the previous trajectory of global warming . the only real solution is to attempt to directly removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere . iron fertilization and algae bloom offer this kind of real solution to global warming actually helping reverse it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iron fertilization reverses globally warming ; other solutions only slow it . <eos>
