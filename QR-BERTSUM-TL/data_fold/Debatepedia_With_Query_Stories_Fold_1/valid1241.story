<s> china/india outsourcing : are exemptions justified in context of outsourcing ? <eos>

<s> it is true that much of the world 's manufacturing and emissions are occurring in china . but this is not a cause for exempting these countries from the emissions standards present in developed countries . this would effectively mean that the world and all the nations that outsource to china get an exemption so long as they are outsourcing to china which would be unfortunate on many levels . the world should not allow for such an emissions loophole and must act to fully constrain emissions in china without exemptions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> world 's manufacturing is in china emissions must be cut there . <eos>
