<s> teaching the controversy : should the controversy be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> evolution should be a central part of the science curriculum because the rest of biochemistry is dependent on it . understanding how and why different organisms work as they do requires a knowledge of mutations natural selection and adaptation which are rejected by creationism . for creationism the classification of living things based on lines of descent and chronological allopatric makes no sense . furthermore understanding how evolution works as a theory helps teach student about the nature of scientific methods -- a matter on which creationists are notoriously shaky . <eos>

@highlight

<s> schools should not taught theory that are totally at odds with each other . <eos>
