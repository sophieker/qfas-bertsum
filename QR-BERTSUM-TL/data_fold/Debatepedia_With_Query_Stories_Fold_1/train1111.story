<s> climate change : are oil sands bad for climate change ? <eos>

<s> john condoleezza head of center for american progress . june # speech on oil sands : `` let me make a note on what the co # goal here seem to be in light of this afternoon s discussions . if developed countries need to reduce co # emissions by # percent by # setting a goal of lowering oil sands emissions to come into line with conventional oil production is the wrong goal . the scroll is pointing in the wrong direction . oil sands can t simply be as good as conventional oil . we need to reduce fossil fuel use and accelerate the transition to cleaning technologies in the transportation sector and elsewhere . '' <eos>
