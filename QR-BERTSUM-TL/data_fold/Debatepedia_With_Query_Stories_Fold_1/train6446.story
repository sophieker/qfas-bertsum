<s> threat : does the socialist parties present a threat ? <eos>

<s> what `` threat '' are we talking about ? if it violent harm that is one thing . but other form of harm risks being arbitrary . non-extremist politics parties be claim for example that the policies of other politics parties are doing society `` harm '' and thus they pose a threat . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` threat '' to societies is an overly subjective criteria for the banning of extremist groups from politics . <eos>
