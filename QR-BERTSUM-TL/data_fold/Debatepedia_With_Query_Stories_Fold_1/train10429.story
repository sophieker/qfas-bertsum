<s> deterrence : is nuclear deterrence irrelevant today ? <eos>

<s> during the gulf war for example one of the factors which prevented iraq from launching missiles tipped with chemical weapon warheads against israel was the threat the usa would retaliate with a nuclear strike . although there is no longer as formal a threat of retaliation as there was during the cold war the very possibility that the use of nuclear weapons by a rogue state could be met a retaliatory strike is too great a threat to ignore . moreover although the citizens of the current nuclear powers may be against the use of force against civilians their opinions would rapidly change if they found weapons of mass destruction being used against them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the deterrent principle still stands . <eos>
