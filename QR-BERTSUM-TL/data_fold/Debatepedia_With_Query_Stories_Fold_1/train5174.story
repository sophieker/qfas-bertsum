<s> political progress : are the politics in iraq miserable warranting a withdrawal ? <eos>

<s> iraqi politicians over-rely on us security forces . this has causing their complacency . settings a date for withdrawing from iraq would forces them to work harder reconcile differences more rapidly improve the iraqi security forces and secure the future of their country . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a coalition timetable would force iraqis to come them and work faster . <eos>
