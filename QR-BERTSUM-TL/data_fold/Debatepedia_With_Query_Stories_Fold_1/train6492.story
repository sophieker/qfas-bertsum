<s> fulfillment of scriptural prophecies <eos>

<s> other `` prophets '' such as jeane dixon edgar cayce and nostradamus have a large following and many claims have been made as to the accuracy of their predictions although many of their predictions failed to they true and also the ones that did they true were or very vague/ self-fulfillable in comparison to the bible or were made too close to their fulfilment and at a time when the odds were easily stacked in their favour . for a lengthier comparison between these false prophets and the bible we again point to bibleevidences.com . <eos>

@highlight

<s> scriptural prophecy is of a exceptional degree of accuracy to predictions from freeze-over canonical sources . <eos>
