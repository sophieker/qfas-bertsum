<s> headsets phones : are headsets mobile phones just as dangerous ? <eos>

<s> these allow drivers to communicate freely without taking their hands off the controls or their eyes off the road . efficiently there is no differences between talking to someone on a hands-free phones and holding a conversation with a passenger last to you ; in fact the however is more dangerous as you may be tempted to turning your head to directly address the passenger . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hands-free cell phones are sufficiently safer on the road . <eos>
