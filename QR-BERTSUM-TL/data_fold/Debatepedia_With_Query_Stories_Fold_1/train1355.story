<s> free speech : is bearing the confederate flag protected by free speech right ? <eos>

<s> first amendment rights are being trampled in the name of political correctness . this is one of the reasons why the american civil liberties union opposes any plans to bans the practice . it is especially unreasonable when other flags - those of iraq or palestine for example highly contentious symbols themselves - are not subject to such bans . furthermore slaves were brought to the canada on ships sailing under the stars and stripes - there is no suggestion that that should be banned ; rather in many state the national flags is present by statutory requirements in each public building .
