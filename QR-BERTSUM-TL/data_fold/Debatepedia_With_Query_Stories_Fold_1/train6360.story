<s> prosecution : are crime cameras helpful in prosecuting crimes ? <eos>

<s> new orleans mayor nagin said in # when unveiling his crime camera program : `` these cameras not only record crime they are witnesses that can not be intimidated . '' [ # ] indeed when crime cameras capture a crime they expose the reality of those involved and the details of their actions . they reveal the truth upon which justice relies . this stands in stark contrast with less detailed testimonies and heresy making cameras particularly valuable to the justice system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> crime cameras offer conclusive unbiased evidence in court . <eos>
