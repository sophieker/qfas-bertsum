<s> humaneness : could the culling of marsupials be doing humanely ? <eos>

<s> the meat would be utilizing for human consumption and pet food and the pelts for soft toys and other items . these kangaroos will not merely be killed and wasted . their lives meat and pelts will be put to a use and this will give meaning to the lives of these kangaroos making the culling at least more humanely than if these resource were merely thrown away . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the beef and skin of culled marsupials will not be wasted . <eos>
