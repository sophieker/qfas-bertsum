<s> prosecution : would this lead to mass prosecutions of parents with good intentions ? <eos>

<s> a ban would not lead to a masses prosecution of children for trivial smacks any more than adults are prosecuted for trivial assaults on other adults currently . the threat of punishment is likely to functions as a deterrent and change parents ' behaviour . moreover there would be less intervention into family life by society workers than there is now . the current law in the uk makes lawyers and prosecutors responsibility for deciding if a smack hurt and thus for fine-tuning levels of acceptable violent in the home . <eos>

@highlight

<s> parents would not be prosectuted for every slap this is more of a deterrent . <eos>
