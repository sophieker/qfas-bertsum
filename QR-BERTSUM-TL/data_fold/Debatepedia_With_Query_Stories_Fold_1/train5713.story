<s> bad apples : should abuse of enhanced interrogation be attributed to bad apples ? <eos>

<s> there are certainly cases of abuses that have occurred in which interrogators have gone beyond the limits of `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' and engaged in what could be called torture inflicting severe pain and suffering and even permanent physical and mental damage . but these are exceptional `` bad apples '' performing these egregious acts and this should not condemn the general character of enhanced interrogation techniques . <eos>

@highlight

<s> enhanced interrogation should not be condemned because of bad apples . <eos>
