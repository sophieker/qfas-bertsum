<s> action analysis <eos>

<s> an importance strategic choices the affirmative must make is whether to argue against the practice of plea bargaining as whole or just plea bargaining in exchanges for testimony . affirmative could try to argue first that plea bargaining is in terms unjust but then contend that even if this were n't true that plea bargaining in exchanges of testimony is unjust . adopting a two two-tiered `` even if '' approach to affirm is always somewhat risky since the danger is the appearance that the affirmative is contradictory . further the negative could always concede that plea bargaining in terms is wrong but that when its necessary to elicit testimony it is just . <eos>
