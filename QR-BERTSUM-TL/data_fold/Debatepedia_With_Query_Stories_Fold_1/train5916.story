<s> emissions : is algae biofuel good for combating global warming ? <eos>

<s> growing algae absorbs c # in the process of photosynthesis . it is a carbon sink . this is why when algae biofuels are burned and emit some c # the emission balance is c # neutral ; it emits only c # it previously absorbed adding no new c # into the atmosphere . because it is carbon neutral in this way it is a renewable energy source that can be produced and burned for energy sustainably . <eos>

@highlight

<s> algae biofuel is carbon neutral ; only emits c # that it absorbs . <eos>
