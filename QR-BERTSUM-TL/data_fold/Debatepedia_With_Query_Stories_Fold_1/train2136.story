<s> vs `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia better than withdraw life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> it is important that man not attempt to play god or nature in subjecting another individuals to euthanasia . rather patients should be allowed to live and die naturally . god or nature intended man to die in a certain ways ( ie . `` naturally '' ) . by euthanizing the individuals a person is deprived of this natural human experiences and its diverted from the intention of the maker . <eos>

@highlight

<s> euthanasia is not a naturally death or as god intended . <eos>
