<s> differentiated responsibilities : do states have a `` common but differentiated responsibility '' ? <eos>

<s> contraction and convergence is a good proposal for addressing the imbalance between per capital emissions around the world . it holds developed countries responsible for cutting their per capita emissions ( contraction ) and meeting developing countries in the middle ( convergence ) . developing countries are fairly allowed to continue to develop and increase per capita emissions to a level equal to developed countries `` in the middle '' . the obligation in this case falls more heavily on developed nations to reduce their emissions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> contraction/convergence equalizes per capita emissions burdens wealthy <eos>
