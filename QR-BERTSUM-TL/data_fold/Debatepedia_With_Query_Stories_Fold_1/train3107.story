<s> govt vs. markets : does govt have a legitimate place here ? <eos>

<s> some claim trans fats are n't the whole problem with people 's health and that they contribute only a little bit to the overall health issues faced by individuals . they claim that making good choices overall is the most important factor . but none of this negates the fact that banning trans fats can make a positive contribution in reducing obesity and heart disease . that a ban can have any such significant effect makes banning trans fats a worthwhile endeavor . solving all or even most of our health problems is too high a bar to judge a ban . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trans fat ban need n't be whole solution to be good . <eos>
