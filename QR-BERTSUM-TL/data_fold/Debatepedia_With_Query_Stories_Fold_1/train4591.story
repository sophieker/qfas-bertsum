<s> rights : is profiling consistently with individuals rights ? <eos>

<s> mark thompson . `` profiling political correctness and airport security . '' the league of ordinary gentleman . november # th # : `` so it s not 'political correctness ' ( aka the equal protection clause of the # th amendment ) that is standing in the way of replacing full-body scans with a strong and effective profiling system : it s reality . all that 'political correctness ' is preventing is the implementation of an equally ( and likely even more ) ineffective piece of security theater in which we single out one minority group for intensive screening while give a pass to everyone else . this would certainly annoy fewer people but it wouldn t make us safer and its sole benefits would be accomplish by treating an entire minority group as second-class citizens . '' <eos>
