<s> patentability ? are gene sequences patentable under existing law ? <eos>

<s> `` patenting life is owning life . '' third world network : `` if we use the determination of the nucleic acid sequence constituting a gene as a criterion for patenting and i understand that this is the case how would we know that the sequence is unique to the organism being patented ? the number of species on earth is estimated to be 10 to 60 million . so far we know the nucleic acid sequences of all the genes only for one species the bacterium escherschia coli . assuming that the patenting of a nucleic acid sequence can be allowed only if it is new to life which would make it a genuine invention could we ever be certain that a nucleic acid sequence which <eos>
