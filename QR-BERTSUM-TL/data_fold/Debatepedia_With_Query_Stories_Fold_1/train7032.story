<s> could this provide an incentive to lower achieve schools ? <eos>

<s> school want money and funding from the government to provide the best possible resource and teachers for their students . having funding given to low achieving school would set a certain benchmark and provide the opportunity and incentive for teachers to taught well and students to improving their knowledge . realize that extra funding would come if good results went up on tests would encourage teaching to be better and students to do well . <eos>

@highlight

<s> schools do need extra funding and providing cash to high achieving schools would provide an incentive to do well . <eos>
