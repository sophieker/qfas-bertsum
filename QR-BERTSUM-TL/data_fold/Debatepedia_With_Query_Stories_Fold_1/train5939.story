<s> risks : are gm foods a health risk ? <eos>

<s> `` what s the problem with labeling genetically-modified ( gm/gmo ) foods ? '' monsanto statement : `` the food and drug administration ( fda ) oversees food labeling laws in the united states . the fda has determined that where genetically-modified crops don t differ from non-gm crops that products containing them don t have to be labeled . fda does require the product to be labeled if the ingredient is a potential allergen or somehow changes the nutritional properties of the food . to date no approved biotech crop is either an allergen or has any significant nutritional differences from non-gm counterparts . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> labeling is wrong when gm foods show no differences with other foods <eos>
