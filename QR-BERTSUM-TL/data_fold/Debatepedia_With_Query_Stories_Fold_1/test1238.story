<s> morality : is mass deported of illegal immigrants morally acceptable ? <eos>

<s> jim gilchrist mba cpa founder and president of the minuteman project in a may # # global politician interview entitled `` jim gilchrist of minuteman project on immigrants terror elections '' : `` i m pro-deportation or if you want to use a nicer word pro-repatriation . you can not have a defeatist attitude towards the problem and have a solution . the repatriation of illegals must begin with a recognition of the problem and a plan . we may be called names but the names our grandchildren will call us will be worse when they have to live in a destroyed country . there must be a multi-faceted approach including arresting illegals and also cut off social welfare programs to them .
