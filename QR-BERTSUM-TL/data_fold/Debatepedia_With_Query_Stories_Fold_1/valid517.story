<s> doctors : are the physicians that perform abortions ok with their act ? <eos>

<s> those people have troubles with parts of their profession . a general for example has troubles send his troops to their death but typically acknowledges the need for this to occur in certain instance . abortion doctors similarly might be challenged by the process of an abortion ( and even believe that they are `` killing '' the fetus ) but nonetheless acknowledge the need for abortions and so are comfortable with their profession . the difficulty doctors experience in performing abortions therefore is not an argument against abortions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> doctors that have difficulty perform abortion but acknowledge its importance . <eos>
