<s> deterrence : is nuclear deterrence irrelevant today ? <eos>

<s> peace during the cold wars was maintained only by a balance of power -- nor superpower had an advantage large enough to be confident of victory . this eventually became the doctrine of mutually assured destruction : both sides had sufficient weaponry to totally annihilate one another and potentially the whole world . although there is no long a balance of power . with the proliferation of nuclear weapons some rogue states be develop the ability to strike at enemies who have no nuclear weapons of their own . it is not clear that the major nuclear powers would then strike back at the aggressor . this is further complicated by the fact that most of the emerging nuclear threats would not be from legitimate government <eos>

@highlight

<s> the idea of a so-called fortified deterrent ' no longer applies . <eos>
