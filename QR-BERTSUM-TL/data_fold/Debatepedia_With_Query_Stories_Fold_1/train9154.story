<s> is the federalization of europe going to benefit europe economically ? <eos>

<s> states because inducements to cooperate or threats to punish may be low fail to provide for the collective benefit therefore essentially `` passing the buck '' to other states and most frequently to the most economically powerful participants . citizens of large states like france great britain and germany frequently complain that smaller states are not paying their `` fair share '' of the costs of the european union . meanwhile smaller states may complain that they are overlooked or even disregarded because of their economically weaker status . these issues will be exacerbated in a european federation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> different states may not contribute equally <eos>
