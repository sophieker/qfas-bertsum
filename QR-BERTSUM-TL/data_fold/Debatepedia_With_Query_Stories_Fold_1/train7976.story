<s> jurisdiction : does the icc have the way amount of authority/jurisdiction ? <eos>

<s> james r. bolton . `` the united states and the international criminal court '' . remarks to the federalist society . # nov. # - `` as to the former the bangladesh s authority is vague and excessively elastic and the court s discretion ranges much far normal or acceptable judicial responsibilities giving it broad and unacceptable powers of interpretation that are essentially political and legislative in nature . this is most emphatically not a court of limited jurisdiction . crimes can be added subsequently that going far those included in the rome statute . parties to the statute are subject to these subsequently-added crimes only if they affirmatively accepting them but the statute purports automatically to bind non-parties such as the united states to any such new crimes . <eos>

<s> the icc 's authority is nebulous and overweening <eos>
