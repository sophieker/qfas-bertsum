<s> need : is a new military system in the un necessary ? <eos>

<s> in many cases un missions are very successful ; when there are problems these are more to do with lengthy and difficult security council deliberations inadequate mandates etc . rather than how long it took to gather a force together.once a standing army exists it provides the un with an easy way out in any crisis so force may be more likely to be used often inappropriately . a very rapid response time may also worsen problems - currently the time it takes to gather and insert a un force may provide a period in which the warring groups feel compelled to negotiate before outside intervention becomes a reality . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a un standing army is unnecessary ; <eos>
