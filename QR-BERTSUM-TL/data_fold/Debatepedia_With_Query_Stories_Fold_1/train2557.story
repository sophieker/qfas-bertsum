<s> shifting crime : do crime cameras merely shifts crime ? <eos>

<s> san francisco mayor said to the san francisco chronicle in # `` when i put the first camera in i said 'this may only moving people up the corner . but the communities there said 'we do n't care we want our alleyway back . ' no one 's actually had a camera up that they wanted torn down in the community . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> even shifting crimes with camera can benefits communities . <eos>
