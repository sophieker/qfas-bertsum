<s> was the genesis account of creation meant to be taken literally ? <eos>

<s> the account in genesis is only the isrealite account of creation . the first chapter of genesis is a wisdom poem and was not written as a modern science book . the account merely shows the isrealite people that they should worship god and not the sun etc . it should be taken therefore as an allegory instead of as literal factual truth . <eos>

@highlight

<s> genesis is an mythical not factual story on creation . <eos>
