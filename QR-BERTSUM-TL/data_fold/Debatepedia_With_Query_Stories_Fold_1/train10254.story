<s> xenophobia : were the jyllands-posten cartoons tolerant or xenophobic ? <eos>

<s> one of the most famed danish cartoon depicts muhammad with a bomb in his turban . the obvious implication of this cartoon was that islam somehow inherently fosters terrorism . this is offensive insulting and degrading . `` it is the satirical intent of the cartoonists and the association of the prophet with terrorism that is so offensive to the immense minority of muslims . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the `` bomb in turban '' cartoon erroneously associated islam with terrorist <eos>
