<s> poverty : does progressives taxation help the poor ? <eos>

<s> this is because the lowest tax band will apply to earnings beneath an initial threshold . therefore the less one earns the lower percentages of one s pay is not taxable . the cost of basic mortality need is by definition a larger proportion of a lower earner 's income and therefore a certain block at the bottom of each income may be tax free altogether to allow for these needs . this protection for the poorest is important because most countries which operate customs tariffs and sales taxes which tend to hit the poor more than the rich in terms of the proportion of their income going in indirect taxation ; progressives direct taxation redresses the balance . <eos>
