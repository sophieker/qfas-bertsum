<s> justice/desert : are executions sometimes required to uphold justice/due desert ? <eos>

<s> david gelernter . `` what do murderers deserve ? '' . commentary magazine . march/april # - `` opponents of capital punishment describe it as a surrender to emotions -- to grief rage fear blood lust . for most supporters of the death penalty this is false . even when we resolve in principle to go ahead we have to steel ourselves . many of us would find it hard to kill a dog much less a man . endorsing capital punishment means not that we yield to our emotions but that we overcome them . if we favor executing murderers it is not because we want to but because however much we do not want to we consider ourselves obliged to . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> life in prison is a sufficient punishment ; execution is excessive <eos>
