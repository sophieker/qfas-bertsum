<s> individual liberty : should individuals be at liberty to using marijuana ? <eos>

<s> people should be at liberty to treat their bodies how they want to . indeed people are allowed to eat and drink to their detriment and even death so why should n't they be able to harm themselves with marijuana use ? this is of course assuming that their using does not harm anyone else . this means as with substances such as alcohol or smokes that requirements be put in place to ensure that another individual 's consumption of marijuana does not violate the liberties of another citizen . if this is attainable with alcohol and cigarettes it seems attainable with marijuana . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people should be free to using cannabis as long as it harms no one else <eos>
