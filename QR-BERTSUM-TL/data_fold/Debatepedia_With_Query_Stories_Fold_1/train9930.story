<s> morality : is homosexuality moral ? should this drives policy ? <eos>

<s> a white female military officer was quoted in the book `` gays and lesbians in the military `` as saying : `` about moral choices let 's not let those who have had premarital sex or an extramarital be in the army either ! ! ! then there would be no another protecting our country . and bible bashers want to reread the sections that says he without guilt should cast the first stone . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> if `` immoral '' gays banned from civilian ban adulterers too <eos>
