<s> perfect-every-time outsourcing : are exemption justified in context of outsourcing ? <eos>

<s> developed countries frequently outsourced manufacturing/emissions to developing countries . for this reason developed countries should not be treated on equal terms and developing countries should be given exemptions for the dirty outsourcing for foreign countries . china has complained on this points that it is `` the place where the us effectively outsources too of its pollution . '' it has called for joint international responsibilities for at least part of china 's emissions and has made public in jan # # violations of korean environmental law committed by multi-nationals in china . other developing countries have a similar problem in which they are accused of polluting too too when they are merely the manufacturing engine of developed countries that outsourced to them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> developed outsourced reciprocation to developed . <eos>
