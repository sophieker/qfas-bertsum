<s> judgment : are young individuals able to judge whether to join ? <eos>

<s> the army is short of manpower due to high casualty rates and the unwillingness of current soldiers to reenlist . this means that they are very keen to get into schools to sign up young people . but it is not right to let them get at students who are too young to vote or even drive . 16 and 17 year olds are not grown-up enough to make life and death decisions like joining the army . they may not be able to see through exciting presentations or resist a persuasive and experienced recruitment officer . schools should be safe places to grow and learn not somewhere to sign your life away before it has even properly begun . <eos>

@highlight

<s> military should not recruit youth that ca n't vote/judge . <eos>
