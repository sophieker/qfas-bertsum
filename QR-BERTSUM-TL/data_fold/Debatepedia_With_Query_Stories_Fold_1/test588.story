<s> punishment : does a lifetime ban fits the crime of drug use ? <eos>

<s> many cheats after being caught out once using drug get a second chance and get caught using drug again . some people just get caught time after time again . for example ben johnson . he was the fastest man in the world - when he was using drugs . he cheated once got a long bans then came back into sport and cheated with drug again and again . if someone has demonstrated that they 're go to cheats with drug we could as well stopping them before they cheats again . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cheats keeping cheating . <eos>
