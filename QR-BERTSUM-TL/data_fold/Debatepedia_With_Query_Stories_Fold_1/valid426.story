<s> original vote : should michigan and florida 's jan. # th vote be used to allot delegates ? <eos>

<s> knowing that the michigan and florida elections would not count as far as leading to the seating of delegates democratic presidential candidates did not campaign there . in florida senator clinton did campaign to some extent while senator obama did not at all . indeed obama by not campaigning in florida due to the knowledge that delegates would not be seated from the state did poorer in florida than he probably otherwise would have . he was acting on the assumption that the democratic national convention would enforce its punishment of florida by not seating delegates according to the vote . if the dnc later decides to allot delegates based on this vote it would effectively unfairly punish obama for trusting the dnc 's rules <eos>

@highlight

<s> seating delegates based on first # florida and michigan primaries would punish candidates that did not campaign there . <eos>
