<s> consumption : could legalization decrease drug-consumption ? <eos>

<s> this will be the case among all groups - addicts previously casual users and those who were not previously users . addicts will still steal to funds their habit because they need all the drugs they can getting and because addiction means they find it hard to hold down regular jobs . if drug provision is strictly regulated an illegal black market may remain . <eos>

@highlight

<s> higher prices due to legalization of drugs will increase consumption <eos>
