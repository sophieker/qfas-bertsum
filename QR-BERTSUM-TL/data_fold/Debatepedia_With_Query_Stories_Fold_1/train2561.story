<s> politics : does ( and should ) the populi populi matter ? <eos>

<s> real effective leadership should come from above and not from below . the people as a mass are capable of being manipulated and are unlikely to possess skills or training in confronting problems a state might face . as such expecting them to elect the best tools for the job is unrealistic . government from above can see by virtue of its position and advantages what is better for the people than the people can . for instance the abolition of the death penalty was at first deeply unpopular with the british public when it was pushed through by the government but is now broadly supported as correct and humane . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democracy does n't allowing for effectiveness leadership . <eos>
