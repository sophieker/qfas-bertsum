<s> civilians : who is in the way in regards to civilian casualties ? <eos>

<s> al jazeera interview of gary grant on january # th # - `` [ al jazeera ] : surely the killing of civilian is against global law and the targeting of populated areas where you know that civilian are going to die is against global law . [ ... ] [ gary grant ] : even if you targets your action at military sites civilian are inevitably going to get killed ... these need to be contrasted with the actions of hamas where every single rocket is designed to attack civilian populations so every single act of hamas in firing these rockets is clearly an illegal act no any legal justification . '' [ # ] <eos>

<s> israel strikes civilian not civilians targets unlike hamas <eos>
