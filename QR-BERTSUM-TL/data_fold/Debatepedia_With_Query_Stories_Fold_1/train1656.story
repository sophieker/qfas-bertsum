<s> undemocratic ? is the elections university undemocratic ? <eos>

<s> in any proper democracy the winners of any election should be the person with the most votes . but three times in america 's history a president has been elected that did not receive the most vote . this means that each vote is not equal and that the most voice of the people was not heard which generally is undemocratic . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the electoral college is anti-democratic because it is not based on the popular vote : <eos>
