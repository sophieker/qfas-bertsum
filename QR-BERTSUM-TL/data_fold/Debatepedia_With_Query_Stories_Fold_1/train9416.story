<s> `` right to die '' ? does each citizen have a `` right to die '' at a time of choice ? <eos>

<s> if someone is threatening to kill themselves it is your morality duty to trying to stop them . you would not for instance simply ignore a man sitting on a ledge and threatening to jump simply because it is his or her choice ; and you would definitely not assist in his suicide by pushing him . in the same way you should trying to help a person with a terminal illness not help them to die . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is a moral duties to attempt to prevent suicide in general ; euthanasia too . <eos>
