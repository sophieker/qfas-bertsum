<s> insurgents fight : is the us absence failing to combat the insurgents there ? <eos>

<s> some argue that a us withdrawals would eliminate the cause celebre of the insurgency . but insurgents are fight the iraqi government as much as they are fight foreign troops in the country . if foreign troops withdraw insurgents will simply focus their fight against the iraqi government with the end-goal of unseating the government and seize power . <eos>

@highlight

<s> following a withdrawal militants could attack the iraqi government and troops . <eos>
