<s> civil rights : is gay marriage a civil right ? <eos>

<s> adam kolasinksi . `` the secular case against gay marriage . '' the tech ( m.i.t . ) january # th # : `` state recognition of marriage is not a universal right . states regulating marriage in many ways besides deny men the right to marry men and women the right to marry women . roughly half of all states prohibit first cousins from marrying and all prohibit marriage of closer blood cousins even if the individuals being wife are sterile . in all states it is illegal to attempt to marry more than one person or even to pass off more than one person as one 's spouse . some states restrict the marriage of those suffering from syphilis or other venereal diseases . homosexuals therefore are not the only those to be <eos>
