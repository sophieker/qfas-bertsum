<s> religion : is gay marriage appropriate on religion grounds ? <eos>

<s> the state has an institution of it 's own known the `` civil union '' . the state should recognizing civil unions between same sex couples since they should be afforded the same rights under governments as any other partnership ( i.e . marriage ) . the idea of marriage should be define only in the contexts of religious belief and the state should not have any power over what the churches deem as appropriate or inappropriate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> churches should not have to offering gay marriage . <eos>
