<s> environment : is ending fossil fuel subsidies good for the environment ? <eos>

<s> not all fossil fuels are the same . some are more polluting than others . natural gas is one of the least polluting fuels for example . many people consider it to be a environmentally-friendly energy superstar for the 21st century . therefore subsidizing natural gas ( a fossil fuel ) can help reduce emissions and foster a cleaner environment . <eos>
