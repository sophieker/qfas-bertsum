<s> health care : which candidate 's health care plan is superior ? <eos>

<s> hillary 's health care plan mandates that all uninsured citizens buy health care . many can not afford to do so and so wo n't . the problem surrounding what you do at that stage . do you then as obama critically asks punish these individuals by for instance garnishing their wages ? this could be extremely divisive as it is in massachusetts and unpolitical . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hillary 's health health plan has enforceable unpolitical mandates . <eos>
