<s> feasibility : is full denuclearization feasible ? <eos>

<s> the world knows how to create nuclear weapons . in fact after over fifty years since the invention of the atomic bomb the technology is fairly well known and old knowledge . this knowledge and the ease of constructing a nuclear weapon makes it difficult to attempt to constrain states from attempting to build the weapon particularly when the incentives would be so high to `` go nuclear '' in a nuclear-weapons-free world . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it 's not possible to abolish nuclear weapons now that the are at large . <eos>
