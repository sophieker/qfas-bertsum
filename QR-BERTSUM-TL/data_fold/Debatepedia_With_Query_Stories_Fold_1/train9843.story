<s> presently cannabis is sold by dealers who have connections with the underworld . the legalization of cannabis will help facilitate the sale of the drug in establishments like amsterdam s `` coffee houses '' . this will shift the sale of cannabis away from the criminal underworld . the severance of this criminal link will ensure that the users of the drug no longer need to come into contact with organized crime . <eos>

@highlight
