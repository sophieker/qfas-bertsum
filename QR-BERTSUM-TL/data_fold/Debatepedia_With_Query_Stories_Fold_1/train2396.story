<s> property : is the libertarian perspectives on properties appropriate ? <eos>

<s> . governments violate the rights of citizen when they force or threaten to force persons to transfers their legitimately held wealth to the state in order to provide for pensions to help the needy or to pay for public merchandise ( e.g . parks or roads ) . persons have a natural right to lives liberty and property . depriving any one of these rights diminishes the others . thus these rights should be considered inviolable . they are important to uphold for their own ends not merely for other expediencies . thus no matter what the cost the individual right to properties should be upheld as an absolute . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people have full rights to their property that governments ca n't depriving <eos>
