<s> history : were palestinians forced out or fled on own will ? <eos>

<s> according to some sources palestinian flights from israel was not compelled but was predominantly voluntary as a result of nine arabic nations declaring war on israel in # . many arabic leaders encouraged and even orders palestinians to evacuate the battle zone in order to make it easier for the arabic armies and fedayeen to demolish the newly found jewish state and israel officially admits any responsibility for the palestinian exodus stating that their flights was causing by the arabic invasion . karsh states that most palestinians decided their status as refugees themselves and therefore israel is therefore absolved of responsibility . <eos>
