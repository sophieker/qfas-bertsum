<s> rights : do corps generally qualify for personhood/rights ? <eos>

<s> the merriam-webster dictionary defines a person as : `` one ( as a human being a partnership or a corporation ) that is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties . '' [ # ] to contend that `` personhood '' can not or has never been linguistically applied to corporations is therefore clearly false . while the debate can continue on other grounds it is plain that the idea of corporate personhood has been long-standing even if not widely accepted . <eos>

@highlight

<s> dictionaries include corporations in definitions of persons <eos>
