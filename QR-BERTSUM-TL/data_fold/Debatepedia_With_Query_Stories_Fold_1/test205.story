<s> rights : is it important to enshrining principles in a bill of rights ? <eos>

<s> any society always assumes that it s position on matters is the most sensible most rational and ultimately best . in reason societies throughout history have had wildly differing expectations of life depending on their religion political and cultural environment . for example a thousand years ago women were considered inferior to women and this was a viewpoint which the vast majority of women shared as they had been brought up to believe in it . the problem occurs when one society with its own oddball view attempts to formulate a legal document that will bind future generations . for example the american bill of rights was considered revolutionary and foresighted in its when but now rights such as the right to bears arms <eos>

<s> a bill of rights would enshrining principle that will change in the future . <eos>
