<s> is prostitution a victimless crime ? <eos>

<s> the process of pimping and kidnapping can and should be illegal regardless of the legality of prostitution . we must remember that at one time people were kidnapped from their homes and transported across the ocean to work on farms yet none would state that farming should be illegal . further these activities occur because prostitution is illegal and vilified . were that not so more women would likely choose the profession and activities such as kidnapping would become less profitable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> pimping kidnapping sex trade are not inherent to prostitution . <eos>
