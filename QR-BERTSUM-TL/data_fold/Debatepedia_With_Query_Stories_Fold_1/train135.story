<s> risks : is a lunar mission considerably safer and therefore desirable ? <eos>

<s> in # a mars orbiter which is an unmanned craft designed to collect data crashed down to the surface of mars when trying to land . this errors was made largely because of another minor errors by the craft 's engineers . [ # ] this spacecraft freefell to the surface of mars where it crashed and exploded into pieces that now litter the martian landscape . if only another errors caused an unmanned craft to fail resulting in the $ # million craft being lost a manned missions would appear to be unsafe . if we allowed any actual human beings going to mars the human errors possibilities are multiply by many factors . <eos>

@highlight

<s> going to mars is extremely danger compared to the moon . <eos>
