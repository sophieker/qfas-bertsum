<s> legal avenues : would it help avoid illegal means of gender selection ? <eos>

<s> in many countries and cultures gender selection happens already usually by selective abortion or abandonment of unwanted babies . everyone can agree that this is a terrible waste of life and potentially very dangerous for the mother concerned and of course many people object strongly to abortion on moral grounds . the use of new technologies to allow gender selection at the start of pregnancy will reduce and hopefully eventually end the use of selective abortion . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gender selection is already occurring by less appropriate means . <eos>
