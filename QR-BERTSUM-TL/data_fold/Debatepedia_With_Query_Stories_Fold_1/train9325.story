<s> corruption : does direct democracy help combat corruption ? <eos>

<s> the interests of elected representatives do not necessarily correspond with those of their constituents . an example is that representatives often get to vote to determine their own salaries . it is in their interest that the salaries be high while it is in the interest of the electorate that they be as low as possible since they are funded with tax revenue . the typical results of representative democracy are that their salaries relatively high . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rep government can lead to conflicts of interest . <eos>
