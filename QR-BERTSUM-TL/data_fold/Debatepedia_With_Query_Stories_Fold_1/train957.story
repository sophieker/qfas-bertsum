<s> `` success '' : is `` success '' in iraq difficult making withdrawals necessary ? <eos>

<s> the fundamentals of the iraq conflicts can not be resolved by strategic adjustments . these fundamentals are : a counter-insurgency war anti-american iraqis that support insurgents sectarian hatreds an endless flood of jihadi terrorists into iraq the difficulties of urban warfare the lack of sufficient numbers of us troops and a host of other factors . no strategic changes can affect these fundamental problems . we should not be fooled therefore by claiming of `` strategic changes '' holding the key to success `` this time '' . and with no prospects for `` strategic modifications '' making success possible the united states and coalition forces should leave . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no strategy changes in iraq can altering the fundamental impossibilities of the conflict . <eos>
