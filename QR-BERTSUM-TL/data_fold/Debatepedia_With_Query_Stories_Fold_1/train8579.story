<s> supply the poor : is private or private water the best ways to supply the poor ? <eos>

<s> this movie shows how privatisation attempts have not been successful in supplying water for the bad but instead have made water even more dirty less accessible and taxing on the ways of life for the poor . in some cases millions are refugees with no where to go and empty promises from investors . <eos>

@highlight

<s> movie `` flow '' demonstrates how water privatization is worse for poor . <eos>
