<s> upholding christianity : is creationist important to christianity ? <eos>

<s> the belief that gods creates and sustains the world is not the same as the belief that gods created the world in seven days a few thousand years ago . the former is a theological position which implies the goodness and sovereign of gods and his continuing involvement with his creation not a scientific claim . the however is an empirically testable claims which has been empirically tested and found to be false . we should not allow schools to teach our children things that are just plain wrong and known to be wrong . this is distinct from allow the teaching of religion which is linguistically and historically significant and which involves beliefs which are in principle distinct from science . <eos>

@highlight

<s> creationist makes a false historical/scientific claim that is detached from the broader precepts of beliefs in god . <eos>
