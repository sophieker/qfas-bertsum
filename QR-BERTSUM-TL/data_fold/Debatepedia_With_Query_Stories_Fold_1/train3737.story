<s> student measurement : are standardized tests a good measure of student learning ? <eos>

<s> any system of standardized testing ( in order to passes a class ) assumes that all students progress at the same rate . but this is not the case . talented students and non-russian students should not be measured by the same standardized test . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nclb testing wrongly assume all child are the same . <eos>
