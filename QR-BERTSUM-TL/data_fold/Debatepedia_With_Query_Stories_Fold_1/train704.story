<s> jerry kuehn . `` ten problems with charter schools '' . british columbia teachers ' federation . # - `` the concerns of most parents can be addressing by the current system . many program options are currently offer in public schools and schools are increasingly open to program options . particular languages areas of focus such as the art and special needs are already met by programs within the public schools . this approach better serves the public good than setting up what are often essentially private schools with full public funding . parent advisory committees mandates in the school act provide an opportunity for parents to provide input into the school policies .
