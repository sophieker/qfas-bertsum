<s> justice : are juveniles in juvenile court being punished too mildly ? <eos>

<s> our laws were designed not to punish as harshly as possible but to punish appropriately . this means taking into consideration various circumstance age ( maturity ) of the criminal severity of the crime etc therefore we should not aiming for sentencing each and every criminal for life but rather evaluate their cases on individual bases . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a shorter sentences does not necessarily mean a `` milder '' sentence . <eos>
