'' change.org . september 27 2010 : `` the second reason to kill the bill is that it s actually worse than nothing . as has been noted here previously the u.s. already averages about 12 percent renewables ; getting to 15 in the next 11 years is a foregone conclusion . the low standard could actually slow the development of clean energy . '' <eos>
