<s> information : does the attorney-client ensuring client give lawyers the full story ? <eos>

<s> clients frequently withold information from their lawyers because they worry that a lawyer will not try his best if the lawyer think they were guilty or that they were worse people . this has nothing to do with a fear about a lacking of confidentiality . indeed this is why many clients frequently do withold vital information from their lawyers now even though we do currently have the doctor-patient privilege . <eos>

@highlight

<s> attorney-client privilege does not cause clients to divulge all information . <eos>
