<s> teach the controversy : should the controversy be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> these are observable facts . what creationists defend is the idea that these changes can not create new species and as a result a design a designer and a creator is necessary . furthermore if schools do not teach competing theories it is comparable to teaching there is no alien life . this can not be proven or demonstrate however it would seem that if that fit in with their theory for the rest of biology the creationists would teach it without question . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the thought that creationists reject mutation or natural selection is ridiculous . <eos>
