<s> pristine environment ? : should antarctic be preserved because it is uniquely pristine ? <eos>

<s> in particular it has a critical impact on the world 's environment and ocean systems . this means that it must be left undisturbed in order to allow further study of such critical international issues as climate change ozone depletion short-range rain forecasting and the operation of marine eco-system ( crucial to sustainable fishing ) . it is also essential to ensure that a polluted antarctica does not undergo changes ( e.g . melting of its ice caps a break-up of its ice sheets ) with a potential disastrous global impact . <eos>

@highlight

<s> antarctica is a pristine and unspoilt continent of good scientific value : <eos>
