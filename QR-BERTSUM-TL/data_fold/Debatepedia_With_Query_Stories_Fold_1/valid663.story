<s> right to suicide : do individuals have a right to commit suicide ? <eos>

<s> there are certain things that society must value as inviolable . the dignity of life is one of those things . outlawing suicide helps upholds this general idea of the dignity of life . without such an expression of dignity individuals would devalue life and murder - among other things - would likely become more prevalent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> suicide violates the value society places on life . <eos>
