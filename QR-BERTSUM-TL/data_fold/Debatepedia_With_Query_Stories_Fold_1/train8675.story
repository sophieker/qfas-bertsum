<s> civil liberties : would forcing drug test uphold the civil liberties of tests students ? <eos>

<s> most judicial systems hold to the notion of innocence until proven guilty . to enforce randomly drug testing ( thereby invading the privacy of student about whom there is no suspicions of drug use ) is to view them as guilty until proven innocent . nothing justifying the sacrifice of human rights for innocent people . <eos>

<s> forced drug-testing would violate the principles of innocent until prove guilty . <eos>
