<s> does the gnu project deserves credit for the success of this operate system ? <eos>

<s> it was never affiliation with gnu and is it 's own operate system . the opensource system uses parts of the gnu toolbox which is not an operate system and does not deserves the loan that it is trying to give to itself . <eos>

@highlight

<s> opensource is not whole of the gnu project . <eos>
