<s> rights : is castration consistent with individual rights ? <eos>

<s> larry don mcquay ( convicted sex offender ) . `` the case for castration . '' washington monthly . may # : `` some good and decent citizens claim that castration itself is barbaric . what is barbaric is what i have done to so many children ; refused to castrate me is barbaric to the children i will molest . compulsory castration of sex offenders whether for their first second or third conviction of a sex offense is currently a violation of the united states constitution because it is considered 'cruel and unusual punishment . ' but no punishment is crueler or more unusual than the pain i have causing my victims . voluntary castration is not unconstitutional but no states allows it . '' <eos>
