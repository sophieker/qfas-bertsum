<s> cbo director douglas elmendorf told cnn : `` [ it would provide ] a substantial boost to economic activity in # and beyond for a few years . '' this is precisely when the economy needs such a `` considerable boost . '' while it is true that he then said `` over time [ however ] the positive consequences of very high federal borrowing build up `` extending the tax cuts should be seen as a short-term thing ; something that would be last as soon as the economy has had a chance to recovery ( within a couple of years ) . this means helping stabilize the economy while taking measure to address the longer-term deficits problems in the nation .
