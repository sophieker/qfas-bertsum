<s> banning categories : is it ok to ban whole categories of arms such as handguns in dc ? <eos>

<s> united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . march 9th 2007 court decision against the dc handgun ban . - `` once it is determined - as we have done - that handguns are 'arms ' referred to in the second amendment it is not open to the district to ban them ... that is not to suggest that the government is absolutely barred from regulating the use and ownership of pistols . the protections of the second amendment are subject to the same sort of reasonable restrictions that have been recognized as limiting for instance the first amendment . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` arms '' falling under the 2nd amendment can be regulated but not banned <eos>
