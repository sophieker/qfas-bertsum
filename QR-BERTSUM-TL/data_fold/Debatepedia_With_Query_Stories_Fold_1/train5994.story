<s> autonomy vs. union : would asean member states be better off alone ? <eos>

<s> it is expensive and it diverts attention from the proper efforts of members government pursuing of the national interest . it is but another unnecessary talking shop . members frequently disagree with one another ( on important international relations issues like the war on iraq and on regional economic issues like labour laws ) so the idea that it helps particular a united front is incorrect . its institutions involves surprisingly high costs ( especially high when they don t achieve anything ) but still complain of under-resourcing ; members are unwilling to committing any more funds so nobody is happy . most to scrap it . <eos>

<s> asean members would be good off pursuing their own national interests : <eos>
