<s> classified information : are guantanamo courts necessary to preserve classified information ? <eos>

<s> thomas wilner . `` we do n't need guantanamo bay '' . wall street . december 22 2008 - `` there is no need for 'new rules ' to handle classified information . congress has already established detailed rules and procedures in the classified information protection act . they carefully balance the defendant 's right to be informed of the charges against him with the government 's need to protect classified information from disclosure . those procedures have worked in the past and would work again . there is also no need for specialized extra-constitutional 'national security courts . ' '' <eos>
