<s> societal arguments -- would society benefit in general from a ban on partial birth abortions ? <eos>

<s> the argument here is that the provisions same to a woman should be as flexible as possible affording her the `` right '' to make life-changing choices throughout the entire course of her pregnancy and not lock her into an unwanted pregnancy after a certain point as could be the case with a partial birth abortion ban . on an issue where good life-changing impact can occur from singular mistakes and particularly when these mistakes are often making during an immature emotional period in a woman 's life it may be important for society to provide women with the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to make major decisions throughout their pregnancy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> whole of the mistake that a girl or woman might have made is not having used sex protection or not <eos>
