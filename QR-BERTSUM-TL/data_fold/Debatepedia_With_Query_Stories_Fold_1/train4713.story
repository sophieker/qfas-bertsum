<s> globally warming : can hydroelectric help cut emissions fight globally warming ? <eos>

<s> sixty per cent of the length of the world 's large river system are at least mildly or severely fragmented by dams . in this context there is not much more room for expanding hydroelectric power especially if we value keeping a portion of the world 's rivers free of dams . this meaning that dam hydro-electric can not expand very much and so should not be seeing as a major part of new energy plans and solutions to global warming .
