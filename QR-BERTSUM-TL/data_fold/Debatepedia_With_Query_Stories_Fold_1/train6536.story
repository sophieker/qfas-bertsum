<s> choice : do vouchers introduce beneficial choice to education ? <eos>

<s> given the limited budget for schools a voucher system weakens public schools while at the same time not necessarily providing enough money for people to attend private schools . some private elementary and high schools are nearly $ 20 000 - $ 30 000 per year . most voucher programs are in the range of $ 5 000 to $ 15 000. many disadvantaged students and parents will not be able to pay the difference - ranging from $ 25 000 to $ 5 000. this means vouchers do not necessarily offer the disadvantaged the opportunity and choice to attend expensive private schools . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor often ca n't afford private schools even with vouchers <eos>
