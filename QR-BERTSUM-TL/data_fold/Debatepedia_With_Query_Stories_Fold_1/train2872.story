<s> priorities : is adaptation a priority requiring greater focus/funding ? <eos>

<s> geoengineering attempts to manipulate various elements of global heating or co2 levels in the atmosphere as a means of mitigating climate change . these ideas include solar shading iron fertilization of algae blooms and others . geoengineering is seen as a last resort on the mitigation front after cutting emissions and so-forth . but it is also considered something that could come before any attempts at adaptation . for if climate change can be stopped through geoengineering adaptation would be unnecessary .

<s> geoengineering should be tried before adaptation . <eos>
