<s> unwanted/adoption : is abortion okay in dealt with `` unwanted '' children ? vs. adoption ? <eos>

<s> if a children is likely to face social difficulties this is absolutely no fact to seek an abortion . the notion that a children will be unhappy due to these conditions or will have no chances of success is ludicrous . it is easy to find examples of poor and neglected children that have growing up to become thriving successful and glad adults . in any case if social problems are the concern these problems should be addressed ; abortion is a terrible band-aid . saying that a children would encounters social problems during his or her development is not the same as saying that he or she is good off dead . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortion is not a just response to social problem facing the fetus <eos>
