<s> maintenance : are tides energy plants easy and cheapest to maintain ? <eos>

<s> repairing tidal energy systems underwater is very challenging and expensive as is repairing anything underwater . the problem is that it requires a combination of divers and submarine equipment both of which are expensive . this is all compounding by the fact that proposed tidal energy plants are generally located in environments with the most violent tides . the mass of water moving via tide can easily damage and corrode tidal energy systems . <eos>
