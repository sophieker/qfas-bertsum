<s> efficacy : are calorie counts effective at improving health ? <eos>

<s> steve chapman . `` force-fed the facts '' . reason . june # # : `` the belief that more facts will generate wiser decisions is appealing but at least in the realm of food yet to be proved . no one seems to have noticed that as nutritional labeling has expanded so have american waistlines . the federal government first required packaged foods to carry such information in the mid- # s and today we are collectively fatter than we were then . what does that suggest ? either people do n't notice what 's in the food they buy or they do n't let the knowledge affect what goes in their mouths . '' <eos>

<s> labeling has not decreased obesity why would calorie counts ? <eos>
