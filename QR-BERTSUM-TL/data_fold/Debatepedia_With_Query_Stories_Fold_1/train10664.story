<s> mixed private-public : is government-run good than mixed private-public universal health ? <eos>

<s> any proposal to shifts to a government-run universal health care program from a private health care system involves destroying the private health care industry . this is a highly detrimental act that would involves massive job loss . the advantage of a mixed public-private universal health care system is that it is not as destructive and damaging in this way . it acknowledges the existence of a private health care industry and the need to preserve at least some of the interests of such a massive and important industry . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a mix private-public systems would preserving existing industries . <eos>
