<s> any such curbs are a form of barriers to free trade and a step towards protectionism . in an eras of trade liberalisation this is undesirable on ideological grounds . strategic interest arguments can be made for almost any industries but are simply excuses for protectionism . increased peace between nations will come through trust interdependence rather than aggressive display of national self-sufficiency which have no places in a peaceful post-cold war world .

<s> the whole idea of investment curbing affronts the ideal of the free market . <eos>
