<s> even if we apply the notion of `` dominion '' and deny animals liberties the principles of `` dominion '' should be applied in a ways that requires humans to seeing themselves as `` stewards '' not dominant exploiters . as `` stewards '' inflicting suffering on animals by hunting them is unacceptable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` dominion '' gives humans stewards ; no right to harm/exploit animal <eos>
