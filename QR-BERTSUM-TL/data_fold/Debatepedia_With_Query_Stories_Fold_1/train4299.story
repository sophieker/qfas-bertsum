<s> impacts on violence : has a firearm ban decreased violence and crimes in dc ? <eos>

<s> dc is very large and very close to maryland and virginia making it very easy for people to legally purchase gun inside of dc and bring them in . it also makes it very easy for blackmarket sales to occur . <eos>

@highlight

<s> alternative measure can be taken in place of a ban to stem crimes and murder . <eos>
