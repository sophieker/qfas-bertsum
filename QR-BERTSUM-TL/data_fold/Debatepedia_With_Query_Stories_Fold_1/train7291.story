<s> legitimacy : would the election of a president make the eu a more accountable institution ? <eos>

<s> direct elections increase the accountability of the president as comparable to those elected by the state heads wherein such accountability gets restricted . the current systems involving # heads of state in the council represented by a rotating president and also the presidents of the commission and the parliament makes it unclear who probably speaks for the eu . <eos>

@highlight

<s> elect an eu vice directly will increase accountability . <eos>
