<s> reform : is reforms the filibusters possibility or is getting rid of it needed ? <eos>

<s> there are many possible reforms of the filibusters that addresses many of the concerns raised by opponents to it . putting the onus on the filibustering party to be particular during a filibusters instead of the majority party is another proposed reform . lowering the number of the number of a `` filibuster-proof '' majority from # to # or so is another proposed method . collectively such reforms are possibly a better way of eliminating any negative elements of the filibusters while avoiding the difficult process of amending the constitution to get rid of it . and this suggests that abandoning the filibusters is an excessive measure . reforming it is sufficient . <eos>

@highlight

<s> eliminating filibuster is excessive ; reforms are sufficient . <eos>
