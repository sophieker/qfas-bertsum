<s> by-catch : is a bans important as a means to reduce `` by-catch '' ? <eos>

<s> in fact when use well drift-nets can have a minimum of by-catch and certainly no more than other fishing methods . by catch can be limited by restricting the sizes of the mesh in the net so that dolphins recognize the net as a wall of sorts and so avoid it or by attaching sound-devices which emit pings ( hence called pingers ( to warn dolphins . limiting the overall length of driftnet as the eu has done can also minimize by-catch . this all points to regulating perhaps then bans driftnet altogether .

<s> by-catch doesn t want to be a reason to bans driftnets . <eos>
