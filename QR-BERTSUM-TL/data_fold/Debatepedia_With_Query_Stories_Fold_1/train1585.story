<s> russian tolerance : would russia tolerate any international intervention in chechnya ? <eos>

<s> the thought that the foreign military has the right to determine russian internal policy is anathema . the strength of nationalistic feeling has grown in the last ten years and contributed to the popularity of putin s original offensive . putin is if anything more hawkish than his predecessor . it is naive to expect anything other than armed opposition to this plan . but demoralised the russian army remains the dominant military power in the southern caucasus and it is practically impossible to change that so the armed opposition will be successful . but if it was not it is impossible to discounted the threats of nuclear war that this kind of conflict represents . that is a totally unacceptable risk .

<s> the russian government has never and will never accept the incursions of foreign power . <eos>
