<s> does the gpl project deserve credit for the successful of this operating system ? <eos>

<s> it was never affiliated with gnu and is it 's own operate system . the linux system uses parts of the gnu toolbox which is not an operate system and does not deserve the credit that it is try to give to itself . <eos>

@highlight

<s> linux is not whole of the gpl project . <eos>
