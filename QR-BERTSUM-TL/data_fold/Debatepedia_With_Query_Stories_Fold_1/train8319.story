<s> life-style : does abortion improve the ability of women to live life how they want ? <eos>

<s> women do not `` want '' abortions . they find themselves in a position in which abortion is the less bad between bad alternatives . this argument is important in explaining that abortion is not about a malicious desire to `` kill babies '' or even to express their right to choose ; it is about allowing women to make the best choice that they can . <eos>

<s> no woman `` wants '' an abortion ; it is only the least bad alternative <eos>
