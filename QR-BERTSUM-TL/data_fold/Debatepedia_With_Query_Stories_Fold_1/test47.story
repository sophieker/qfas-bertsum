<s> in schools : should the confederate flag be banned in schools ? <eos>

<s> this is very different from the other disruptive influences identified here . they have no positive contribution . on the other hand pride in one s region is a legitimate even laudable passion . this is an attempting to refute southern heritage ; it shouldn t be allowed in schools or anywhere else . in # the u.s. supreme court ruled in tinker v. des moines independent community school district that school authorities could not prohibit students from wearing black armbands to protest the cambodia war - why can t students show their supporting for their home ?

@highlight

<s> confederate flag representing pride in one 's community ; although miniskirts . <eos>
