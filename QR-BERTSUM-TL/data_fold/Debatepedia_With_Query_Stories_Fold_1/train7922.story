<s> democracy : is seating the delegates necessary in preserve democracy ? <eos>

<s> certainly the florida and michigan democracy parties are responsible for breaking the rules of the democracy national committee by attempting to moving their state primary back in the calendar . punishing them is an appropriate measure . but it is unfair and undemocratic to unseat the delegates of these states as the chief recipients of this punishment are actually the michigan and florida democracy voters who are subsequently disenfranchised . voters should not be punished for the mistakes of their leaders . rather punishment should focus on penalizing the state democracy parties and their leaders . this would be a more just punishment and more democratic . in the # elections the best response would be to allow the voters to have their voices herds by <eos>

@highlight

<s> punishing the flor . and mich. democratic states parties should not also punish voters . <eos>
