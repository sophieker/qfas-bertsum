<s> crime : does capital punishment helping protecting the private and deter crime ? <eos>

<s> richard r. eddlem . `` ten anti-death penalty fallacies '' . the new american . # june # - `` if investment punishment teach that it 's permissible to kill do prison sentences teach that it 's permissible to holding someone against his will and do fines teach that it 's permissible to steal ? in actuality this fallacy confuses killing the innocent with punishing the guilty . to punish the guilty via the death penalty is not to condone the shed of innocent blood . just the opposite in fact since investment punishment sends a strong messages that murder and other investment crimes will not be tolerated . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> executions punished the guilty so ca n't encouraging killing the innocent <eos>
