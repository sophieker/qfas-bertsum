<s> bogus dichotomy : can debate avoiding the problems of bogus dichotomy or not ? <eos>

<s> a debate be merely be a comparative investigations between two cases . for example a debate between the comparative advantages and disadvantages of wind-farm and corn ethanol energy need not be seen as excluding consideration of all other alternatives . these other alternatives however should be mentions and a thorough investigations of their comparative advantages and disadvantages should be pursued in separate debates . in these separate debates a full picture of all of the alternatives can developed . yet it is important to examine the pros and cons of every alternative as compared to every other alternative . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a debate between two alternative does not inherently imply that there are only two alternative to choose from . <eos>
