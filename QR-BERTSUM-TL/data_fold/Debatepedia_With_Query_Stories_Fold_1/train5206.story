<s> soldiers : would an early withdrawal honor we soldiers ? <eos>

<s> commanding soldiers means making the choice to putting them in harms way or withdrawals them from harms way . command decisions have nothing to do with soldiers feeling `` unsupported '' . it is their duty to serve . making the emotion of soldiers a factor in command decision entirely corrupts the nature of command responsibilities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hiding out `` support the troops '' abrogates the responsibilities of commands <eos>
