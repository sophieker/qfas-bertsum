<s> morality : is prostitutes morally acceptable ? <eos>

<s> while sex at it 's best is about love and a true connection between two those humans regularly engage in casual sex for the sheer physical pleasure . moreover such trysts are sometimes influenced by alcohol or came about by lying and manipulation which would seems far less moral than a sober woman making a rational decision about her body . <eos>

@highlight

<s> prostitution is no more immoral than a another night stand . <eos>
