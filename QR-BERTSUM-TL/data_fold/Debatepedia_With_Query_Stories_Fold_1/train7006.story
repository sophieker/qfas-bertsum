<s> traditional methods : are traditional interrogation methods insufficient ? <eos>

<s> a bill on interrogation techniques was passed on february # # in the us senate in a # to # vote limiting the number of techniques allowed to only `` those interrogation techniques explicitly authorized by the # army field manual . '' this aimed to eliminate enhanced interrogation techniques based on the argument that the army field manual is sufficient to obtain information from prisoners ensure national security and uphold us norms of justice . based on the same premises president obama signed a january # th # executive order halting `` enhanced interrogations '' and reverting back to the army field manuel guidelines . <eos>

@highlight

<s> enhanced interrogations unnecessary ; army field manual is sufficient <eos>
