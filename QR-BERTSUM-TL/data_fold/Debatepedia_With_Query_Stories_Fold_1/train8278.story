<s> israel : is israel 's policy of `` targeted assassination '' justified ? <eos>

<s> whenever one country or groups attempt to assassinate the leader of another group the door is closed wide for counter-assassination attempts . one assassination attempt makes it too more politically legitimate for a group to respond in-kind with an assassination attempt of their own . because it is easier politically it becomes more likely . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assassination breed destabilizing pentor attempt <eos>
