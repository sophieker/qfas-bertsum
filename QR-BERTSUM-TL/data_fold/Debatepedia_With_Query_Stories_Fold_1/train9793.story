<s> other distractions : is cellphone use uniquely distracting ? <eos>

<s> these include eating changing tape retuning the radio arguing with your spouse about directions try to stop children bickering etc . we should not introduce a law that victimizes mobile phone user under all conditions while completely ignoring many other causes of accidents . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many things in car are just as distracting as cells phones <eos>
