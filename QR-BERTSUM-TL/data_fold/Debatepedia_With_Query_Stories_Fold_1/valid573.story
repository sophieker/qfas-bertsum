<s> crime : does capital punishment help protect the private and deter crime ? <eos>

<s> it is not proper to conclude that more executions causes higher crime rates with the restricted information available . at a minimum the issue is too contested to bases any policies on the conclusion that the died penalty `` deters crimes '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` deterrent-effect '' of killings is too controversial to justifying policy . <eos>
