<s> innocents : is it mistake to be concerned about executing innocents people ? <eos>

<s> last # # in # us states have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence . [ # ] the innocence project indicated that more than # people have been exonerated on the basis of dna testing that concluded that they were innocent . [ # ] this appears to create a likelihood that many individuals have probably been executed that were innocent . this is too many especially when the executed are seeing as innocent victims of the state . this is harmful to the state and the judicial system and is sufficient evidence to shut down the practice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> risk of executing innocents those undermines death penalty <eos>
