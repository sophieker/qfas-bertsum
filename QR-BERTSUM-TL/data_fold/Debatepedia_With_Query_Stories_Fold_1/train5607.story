<s> international stability : can assassination aid international stability ? <eos>

<s> one of the reasons that governments decided that they should not assassinate other leaders was that this helped uphold a standard that protects a state 's own leaders . if governments attempt to justify some assassinations these norms are undermined and world leaders become more vulnerable to attempts on their lives . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assassinations erode norms against assassination ; jeopardizes leaders . <eos>
