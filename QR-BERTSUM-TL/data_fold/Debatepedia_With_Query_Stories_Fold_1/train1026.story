<s> vs. `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia better than withdrawing life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> it is important that man not attempt to play god or nature in subjecting another individual to euthanasia . rather patients should be allowed to live and die naturally . god or nature intended man to die in a certain way ( ie . `` naturally '' ) . by euthanizing the individual a person is deprived of this natural human experience and its diverted from the intentions of the maker . <eos>

@highlight

<s> euthanasia is not a natural death or as god intended . <eos>
