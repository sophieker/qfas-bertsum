<s> choice : do vouchers introduce beneficial choice to education ? <eos>

<s> parents and student have a right to choose what school they will attend . forcing a child to attend a public school even if it is not a healthy and productive environment for them is wrong . vouchers pay children and their parents are right to choose which school best fits their need and desires . it affords greater decision-making power and freedom to citizen instead of the states on a matter of tremendous significance to their lives and futures . this is righteous in principle . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vouchers honor right of parents/students to choosing schools <eos>
