<s> legality : is the blockades legal under international law ? <eos>

<s> after israel 's bilateral disengagement plan from the gaza strip israel no longer occupied gaza with troops . but israel has retained control over gaza 's airspace and coastline and over its own border with the territory . egyptian has control of its border with gaza ( except for the tunnels ) . israel and egyptian also control the flow of goods in and out . israel controls fuel imports to gaza and also controls the majority of electricity use in gaza ( approximately # % ) which it supplies from the israeli electrical grid . so while israel may not have troops in gaza any more it has too much control over too many areas of life there . it is effectively an occupier and its blockade should be seeing in this <eos>

@highlight

<s> israel controls too much of gaza ; it is an occupier . <eos>
