<s> to preserve or save artifacts : is it never justified to remove artifacts in order to preserve them from destruction ? <eos>

<s> a significant portion of cultural treasures was stolen from countries that are now in a poor shape ( be it due to a raging civil war famine etc . ) therefore repatriating the artifacts would almost certainly equal their destruction . <eos>

@highlight

<s> war-torn countries are not ideal recipients of cultural artifacts . <eos>
