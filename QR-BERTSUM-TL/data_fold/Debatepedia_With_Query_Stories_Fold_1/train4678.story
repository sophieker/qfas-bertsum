<s> regulation : could/should the state make partial safer ? <eos>

<s> under prohibitions no proper studies can be doing because we ca n't take proper measurements of the supply side we do n't know who is using what . realize what is gonig on ins the first basic requirement for reducing the potential for harm . it is only by legalising drugs that the supply side can be properly control and regulated . this would think selling drugs in known quantities and known purity levels from licenced venues by accountability people . under a legal regime we could have such measures as age limits for sales . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legalization enables measurements of abuser populations . <eos>
