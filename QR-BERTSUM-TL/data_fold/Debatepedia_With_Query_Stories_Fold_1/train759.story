<s> emissions : can hybrids vehicles significantly reducing greenhouse emissions ? <eos>

<s> kelly cunningham . `` the case against hybrid cars '' - `` to know the hybrid truly you must observe it 's manufacture from start to finish . to make the massive battery found in the typical hybrid nickel must be smelted- the fumes and byproducts and waste produced in the initial smelt is massive . the area in ontario where the initial smelting for the toyota prius batteries occur has become barren and scarred and lifeless in the less than two decades that the smelting plant has been situated there ... just the shipping involved in the early life of a hybrid battery is horribly pollutive- coal-powered ships cargo planes and deisel trucks all over the worlds constantly running devoted to the tasks of making more environmentally sound <eos>
