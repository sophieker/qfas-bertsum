<s> eezs : should a ban extend into exclusive economic areas ? <eos>

<s> this should be enough : it provides fish with enough breeding space to recover from overfishing . if some countries then decide to overfish and thereby exhaust certain species of fish within their own exclusive economic zone then that is their sovereign right to do so . apparently their government and population thought catching these fish was more important then biodiversity and the international community has no business intervening in these domestic issues . as long as the high seas are safe there is no problem .

<s> there is a ban on the use of driftnets in international waters already . <eos>
