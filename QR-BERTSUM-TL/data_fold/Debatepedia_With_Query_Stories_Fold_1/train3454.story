<s> morality : is the bail out of greece morally permissible ? <eos>

<s> `` bailing out greece is not the answer '' . allister heath . february 2010 : `` greece and any other european economy that benefits from a bailout would officially have to fulfill extremely strict conditions ; they would in effect lose their fiscal independence a move which would be unlikely to fill the greek unions with joy . mass anti-cuts demos are already taking place ; in truth athens is stretching credibility beyond breaking point when it claims that it will slash its budget deficit from 12.7 per cent of gdp in 2009 to 2.8 per cent by 2012 .
