<s> self-determination : does tibetan have the way to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> us vice abraham lincoln in justifying efforts to maintain the union in the face of an imminent law war says in # `` a house divided can not stand '' . unity was argued to be essential to the integrity and future of the union . china can put forth the same rationale for forcing tibet to remain part of china . if tibet were to achieve independence both china and tibet would be weaker with less geopolitical strength and with greater tensions and opportunities for conflict . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the chinese governments has a right to protecting the unity of china against tibetan separatism . <eos>
