<s> human rights : does treaties strengthen migrant human rights ? <eos>

<s> some people consider access to the internet to be a `` human right '' . others consider the ability to cross borders freely as a `` human right '' . the definitions of human rights is constantly expanding . it is for this reason that accepting a migrant workers treaty that protects a migrant 's `` human rights '' is risky . it could mean that these migrant 's rights are interpreted by some in the un to be broader and more inclusive than a state thinks they should be and gives it possible that these rights only expanding over time . <eos>

@highlight

<s> humans liberties are subject to interpretation under migrant workers treaty . <eos>
