<s> while codes of human rights are effective bases for enforcing political and legal requirements they are less effective in dealt with social and economic ones . it is realistic to use sanctions to enforce rights to free expression and the rule of law ; impossible to force an impoverished state to maintain western requirements of education and labour law which did not exist when the west developed . this use of sanctions merely lessens their impact when use for the correct purposes . <eos>
