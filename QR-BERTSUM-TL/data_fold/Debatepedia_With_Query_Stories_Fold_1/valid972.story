<s> libel/misinformation : does wikipedia safeguard well against these problems ? <eos>

<s> because wikipedia is widely used often showing up high in google searches and its dangers are not well understood by many people misinformation in wikipedia articles can easily spread to other external sources . in turn the external source ( which may not have cited the wikipedia article ) may be used as justification for the misinformation in future revisions of the wikipedia article . this is sometimes called an echo chamber and some well-known wikipedians including wales have done it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia 's popularity makes the spread of misinformation/libel common . <eos>
