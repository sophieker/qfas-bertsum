<s> politics : do we benefit from globalization ? <eos>

<s> meaning that `` international institutions of governance represent elites and governments rather than individuals or groups and are thus not able to be held accountable for their actions . rarely is an individual able to elect ( or vote out ) representatives to a supranational body ( a rare exception being representatives to the european parliament ) . thus unlike politics at the national level in a democratic system of governance there are few if any avenues through which global citizens may articulate their interests via conventional politics . '' [ `` ap comparative government and politics briefing paper : globalization '' by matthew krain ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> institutions of global governance mean a democratic deficit <eos>
