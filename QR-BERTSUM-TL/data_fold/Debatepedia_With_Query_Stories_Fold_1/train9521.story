<s> war crimes : does the bangladesh help fight genocide and war crimes ? <eos>

<s> the icc like the un secure council will become only a tool for protecting the rights and deeds of a few countries . genocide in those regions is a problem surely but the war crimes in iraq and afghanistan were never discussed in an international forum . can this icc actually check war crime in those countries ? obviously no ! how can the we for instance join a court that will point out its own crimes ? even before attacking iraq the un was made a tool to attack and not a place to have discussions and to forestall war . since its useless to create such a court in which propaganda lobbyists and influence of power will have the major role the plan should <eos>

<s> icc is only a tools for protect interests of powerful states . <eos>
