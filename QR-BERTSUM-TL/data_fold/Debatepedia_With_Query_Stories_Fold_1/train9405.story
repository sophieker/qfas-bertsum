<s> clone : is cloning fair to cloned humans ? <eos>

<s> if clones are treated poorly by society they will lead less happy lives as others . if they are treated well they will likely lead equally happy lives as normal people . because their happiness will depend largely on how we receive them we need only adjust our attitude to be more receptive . banning cloning because we will mistreat them is not fair ; it punishes clones for our failures . <eos>

<s> clones ' quality-of-life depends on how they are received/treated <eos>
