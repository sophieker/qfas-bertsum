<s> politicizing olympics : is it acceptable to politicize the olympics with boycotts ? <eos>

<s> while it is easy to say that sport and politics should exists individually particularly in the contexts of the olympics the reality is that the olympics have always been politicized . the # # and # olympics were all politicization in a significant way . even in the # summer olympics in greece president bush used it as an opportunity to argue that the war on terror had making it possible for afghani and iraqi athletes to compete . so while it may sound appropriate to claim that the olympics should not be politicization the reality is that it always has been and that there continues to be a legitimate place for it to express national and international interests . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the olympics have never been politicization <eos>
