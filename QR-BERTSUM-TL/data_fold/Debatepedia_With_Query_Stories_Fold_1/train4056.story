<s> is is fair for overseas nations to be denied aid because of their policies ? <eos>

<s> if a country is in want of support from another country and the country is denying cash and/or resources because of a policy it is wrong . the country that gives can not control the other countries policies and laws . people should not deny resources due to a law that has nothing to due what the country is asking for . if peru was asking for foreign aid to helping with their hiv & aids problem and the us denying the aid due to that countries abortion policy would that be right ? does abortion have something to do with hiv & aids ? should the us restrict their ability to give because of a policy that has nothing to do with the original problem ? <eos>
