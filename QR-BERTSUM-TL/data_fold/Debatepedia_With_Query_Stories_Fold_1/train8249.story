<s> illegally aliens : is the convention appropriate in its provisions on illegally immigrants ? <eos>

<s> the treaty requires that countries provide full legal procedures for illegal aliens . this would limit the ability of a nation to quickly process and deport illegal aliens . in some countries large immigration problems make such lengthy judicial processes untenable . and it is not the fault of the governments that a massive and constant flooding of illegal immigrants makes judicially and equitably handling each and every one of them impossible . in such instances of a breach of national and sovereignty security full legal processes for non-citizens is merely not an option not is signed a treaty that requires this . <eos>

@highlight

<s> migrant treaty increases burdens of processing illegally aliens . <eos>
