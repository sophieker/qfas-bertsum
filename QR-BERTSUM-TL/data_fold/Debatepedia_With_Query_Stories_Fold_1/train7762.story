<s> to preserve or save artifacts : is it ever justified to remove artifacts in order to preserve them from destruction ? <eos>

<s> a significant portion of culture treasure was stolen from countries that are now in a poor shape ( be it caused to a raging civil war famine etc . ) therefore repatriating the artifacts could nearly certainly equal their destruction . <eos>

@highlight

<s> impoverished countries are not perfect recipients of cultural artifacts . <eos>
