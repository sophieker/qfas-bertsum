<s> afghan security forces : are more troops needed to train/foster afghan security forces ? <eos>

<s> bruce riedel and michael o'hanlon . `` why we ca n't go small in afghanistan '' . usa today . september # # : `` afghan forces simply do not have the capacity to do the protecting themselves at this point and given the challenges of building up new institutions in afghanistan after decades of war will not have the ability until at least # . even that distant date will be postponed further if we do not deploy enough forces to mentor and partner with afghans as they build up an army and police force largely from scratch . this adds up to a prescription for a drying up of intelligence .
