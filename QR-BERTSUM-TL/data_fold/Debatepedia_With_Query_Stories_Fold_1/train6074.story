<s> science : does space exploration benefit science human understanding ? <eos>

<s> there are few experiment so important that they can justify the massive cost needed to allow them to be carried out by humans in zero gravity . nasa making a lot of noisy about growing zero-gravity protein crystals as a potentially cure for cancer when it was trying to justify building the iss but has since dropped the claims as experiment have displayed the claims were overstated . <eos>

@highlight

<s> few missions to space have produced noteworthy scientific results . <eos>
