<s> general humaneness : is tenderloin farming generally humane or cruel ? <eos>

<s> after baby cows are taken away from their moms and sold at auctions they are taken to a tiny wooden crates that they will live in for the whole of their short lives . they can not exercise or even lie down and they are kept in darkness and deprived of certain nutrients in order to ensure that their muscles remain weak and tender when consumed by humans . treating baby cows in this way is not justified by any human desire for tender meat . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> veal farming is inherently inappropriate to calf to meet market demands <eos>
