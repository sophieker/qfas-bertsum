<s> analogous services : is universal health health analogous to other government services ? <eos>

<s> while many those compare health care to police stations and fire stations they are not the same services . health care is largely about providing a service to the individual that compensates often for poor individual choices . fire stations and police departments on the other hand provide services to a community and focus on protecting individuals against things they have no controls over ( crime and fires ) . the differences are very significant in regard to what the state is obligation to provide . the state is obligation to protect citizens from one-another . but the state is not obligation to protect citizens from themselves . universal health care is wrong-headed to the extent that it involves protecting individuals from themselves . <eos>

@highlight

<s> healthcare problems are more about individual choices than fires and crime . <eos>
