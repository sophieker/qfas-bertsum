<s> rights : is it wrong to believe that animals have rights ? <eos>

<s> a number of writers indicate that modern humans have become desensitized to animals having lost daily contact with them in the wild . in particular some writers indicate that there is infrequent eye-contact between wild animals and humans and this has damaged our ability to sympathize with their likeness to us making it easier ( wrongly ) for us to kill them and exploit them . <eos>

<s> modern humans have lost touch with animals and our likeness <eos>
