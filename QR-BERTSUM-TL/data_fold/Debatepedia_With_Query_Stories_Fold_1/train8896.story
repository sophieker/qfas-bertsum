<s> universal care : is mandatory insurance a good means to universal care ? <eos>

<s> many argue that health care is a right and thus that universal health care is a necessary provision . this is then used to justify mandates as a means to universal care . but health care is not a right as only things that could be consider `` natural '' `` innate '' or `` god-given '' can be considered rights and health care does not qualify as such . <eos>

@highlight

<s> premise of insurance mandates that health care is a right is false <eos>
