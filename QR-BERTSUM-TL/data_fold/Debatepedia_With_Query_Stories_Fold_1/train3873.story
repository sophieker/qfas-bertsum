<s> imminent threat ? -- is it `` imminent '' that iran will produce nuclear weapons ? <eos>

<s> iran 's history of defiance secrecy and deception surrounding its nuclear program undermine its claim that its nuclear endeavors are peaceful and legitimate . additional factors such as the low need for nuclear energy in iran due to abundant fossil fuel energy as well as iran 's rejection of global deals that would provide external source of plutonium fuel undermine iran 's claim to a peaceful nuclear energy program . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iranian is seeking nuclear weapons not simply nuclear energy . <eos>
