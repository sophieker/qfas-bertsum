<s> families : do the families of patient have an interest in euthanasia ? <eos>

<s> where euthanasia is currently illegal it is a hopeless desperate act carried out in anonymity and often as a cry for help . the impact on the family who remain can be catastrophic . by legalizing assisted suicide the process can be brought out into the open . in some cases families might have been unaware of the true feelings of their loved one ; being forced to confront the issue of their illness be do great good perhaps even allowing them to persuade the patient not to end their life . in other cases it makes them part of the process : they can understand the reasons behind their decision without feelings of guilt and recrimination and the terminally ill patient can speak openly to <eos>

@highlight

<s> families will abuse euthanasia simply to reducing family strains . <eos>
