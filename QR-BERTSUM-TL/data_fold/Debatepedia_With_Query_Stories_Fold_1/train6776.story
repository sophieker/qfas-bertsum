<s> even the most liberal government would protect its citizens by prohibiting activities that lead to death or serious injury.yet each participant will need to predict the exact physical consequence of every action . moreover every police investigation into even the most minor sado-masochistic injuries would require a torturous inquiry into the extent of each victim s consent . the difficulty of proving that a victim of rape did not consent to sexual intercourse is well documented . how much greater the difficulty of establishing that a victim of sado-masochism did consent but only to a certain degree of injury ? thus there are two equally unappealing scenarios : either participants being convicted of heinous crimes on account of sheer accident or misfortune or victims <eos>
