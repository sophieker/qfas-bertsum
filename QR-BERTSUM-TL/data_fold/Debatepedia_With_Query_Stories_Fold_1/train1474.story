<s> equality : can earmarks be distributed equally ? <eos>

<s> there is no reason why earmarks must benefit all citizens similarly even if they do roughly achieve this objective in the long-run . some citizens and communities have greater needs than others even -- sometimes -- in the long-run . it would not be inherently unfair for a community that suffers from coastal erosion and flooding for example to receive more earmarked dollars than another community in the long-run . <eos>

@highlight

<s> earmarks need not benefits all equally to be justified . <eos>
