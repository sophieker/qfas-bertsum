<s> politics : can judges function well or better in the political process ? <eos>

<s> dirk olin . `` judicial selection : does any method work ? '' . judiciary reports . april 9th 2008 : `` electing judges puts enormous control into the hands of a few party leaders who ( by definition ) are unmitigated whores . the political process of becoming a party nominee reflects the worst of all worlds internal favoritism by paying off political debts or favors with a judicial nomination without regard to merit or even basic competence . licking envelopes for a party boss is not a primary qualification for being a judge . it is however for being a judicial nominee . '' elected judges are also pressured to join political parties as a means of appealing to voters . <eos>

@highlight

<s> elected judges are effectively forced to join political parties <eos>
