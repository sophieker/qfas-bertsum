<s> understanding conflict - does the international community have an inadequate understanding of the conflicts at hand in africa ? <eos>

<s> a one-size-fits-all international response fails to take notice of these circumstances meaning that diplomatic negotiations or mediation by these international countries often disintegrate . african leaders also tend to have greater credentials when dealing with each others affairs through forums such as sadec whereas foreign intervention can not expect the same levels of trust and co-operation from african countries . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the unique situations and power organisations present in many of the african conflicts are only well understood by the countries <eos>
