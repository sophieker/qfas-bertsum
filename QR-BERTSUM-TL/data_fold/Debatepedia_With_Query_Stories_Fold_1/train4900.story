'' real clear politics . november 20 2009 : `` alternatively holder tried to make the case that he chose a civilian new york trial as a more likely venue for securing a conviction . an absurdity : by the time obama came to office ksm was ready to go before a military commission plead guilty and be executed . it 's obama who blocked a process that would have yielded the swiftest and most certain justice . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> military tribunal would have been faster with ksm <eos>
