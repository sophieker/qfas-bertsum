<s> barbaric procedure : is partial-birth abortion a barbaric procedure ? <eos>

<s> on this basis it may be appropriate to conclude that a fetus fetus and a convicted death-row criminal should be treatment with a similar level of decency . given that most liberal democracies prohibit violent forms of capital punishment it may then take that liberal democracies ( and others ) should prohibit the commonly methods of partial birth abortions on the grounds that they are excessively violent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a ban on partial birth abortion could stopping other even more `` gruesome '' forms of late term abortions . <eos>
