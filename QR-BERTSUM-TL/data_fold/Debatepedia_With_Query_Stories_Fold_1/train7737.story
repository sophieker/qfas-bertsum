<s> children : are the offspring of incestuous couples healthy or at-risk ? <eos>

<s> conclusively determining beyond a reasonable doubt that incest is the cause of a specific defect in the child of an incestuous couple is very difficult . this makes it difficult to base a ban on incest on the presumption that incest is the cause of defects . <eos>

@highlight

<s> incest is not easily determined as cause of defect . <eos>
