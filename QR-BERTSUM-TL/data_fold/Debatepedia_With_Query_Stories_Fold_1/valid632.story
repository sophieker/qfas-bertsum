<s> network owners : is net neutrality great for isps ? <eos>

<s> by setting out clear rules about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable behavior isps will avoid getting into trouble like comcast did when it blocked bittorrent users in early # . this would helping networks owners avoid getting into trouble both with anti-competitive laws as well as their customer who get angry when they discover that the company crossed the line in blocking content discriminate between content or charged extra for data from another site versus another . <eos>

@highlight

<s> profit neutrality provide law consistency that is good for isps . <eos>
