<s> ocean ecosystems : does steel fertilization preserve ocean ecosystems ? <eos>

<s> `` a scientific critique of oceanic iron fertilization as a climate change mitigation strategy '' . greenpeace research laboratories . september # - `` iron fertilization results in other essential nutrients such as nitrates phosphates ad silicates being used up as the phytoplankton bloom progresses . consequently this could result in a reduction of these nutrients down-current from an iron- fertilized area . in turn a lack of nutrients would cause a negative impact on phytoplankton down-current resulting in a reduction in improved biological productivity . this would be likely to have a repercussions negative impact on all other marine life because phytoplankton underpin the marine food web . indeed because of this phenomena modeling studies have predict that commercial-scale iron fertilization of the ocean could have a significant <eos>
