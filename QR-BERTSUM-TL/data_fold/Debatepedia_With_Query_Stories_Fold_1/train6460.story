<s> donor countries : is the contribution to the worlds banks a poor investment ? <eos>

<s> the broadest objective of the bank is the alleviation of poverty and long term economic development not generating a turnover for its shareholders . the shareholders benefits from finding an efficient agency to distribute the funds that have been earmarked for donation in the form of foreign aid rather than overseas investment . as commentators have noted to argue that aid helps the domestic economy is like saying a shopkeeper benefits from having his cash register burgled so long as the intruder spends part of the proceeds in his shop ! in any case the ibrd represents a very favourable investment for donor countries that more than offset the lower returns from ida . for example germany receives $ # . # in contracts per taxpayer dollar <eos>

@highlight

<s> the world bank should not seek its justification in being a financially sounds investment for the donor countries . <eos>
