<s> splitting delegates : would splitting the delegate between obama and clinton make sense ? <eos>

<s> the extent to which floridians and michigan voters are given a voice in any elections is the extent to which their will is given power . this means that if these voters favor a candidate with # % of their votes that their delegate number reflect this and that this has some impact on the outcome of the primary elections . splitting the delegates does not recognize the particular will of the people for one candidate or another . moreover it does not give any power to these voters as it gives them absolutely not influence over the outcome of the elections . in this way it provides no power to the collective state democratic parties . <eos>

@highlight

<s> split the delegates could not give floridians and michigan voters any say . <eos>
