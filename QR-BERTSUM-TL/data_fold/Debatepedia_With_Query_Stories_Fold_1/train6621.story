<s> storage : can hydrogen fuel be effectively storing in cars ? <eos>

<s> amory lovins ceo of rocky mountain institute . `` twenty hydrogen myths '' . # june # - `` myth # . we lack a safe and affordable way to store hydrogen in cars . this problem was solved several year ago . such firms as quantum ( partly owned by gm ) and dynetek now selling filament-wound carbon-fiber tanks lined with an aluminized polyester bladder instead of the traditional solid steel liner ( cutting weight by half and materials cost by a third ) . such carbon tanks have ~ # # times the performance of an aluminum or steel tank but can t corrode and are extremely rugged and safe unscathed by crashes that flatten steel cars and shred gasoline tanks . the car isn t driving around with highly pressurized hydrogen pipes <eos>

@highlight

<s> oxygen storage in car is available and inexpensive <eos>
