<s> darting/euthanasia : is darted and euthanizing kangaroo humane ? <eos>

<s> kangaroo culling by darts for sedation and then with poison to euthanize kangaroos can actually lead to severe distress pain and suffering among individual kangaroos and groups of kangaroos . first due to the lower accuracy of darts a sharp shooter must be too closer with darts than with bullets which often disturbs the kangaroo herd . second darts do not killing kangaroos immediately nor do they immediately sedate them creating the potential for the thrashing around of a kangaroo which results in their injury suffering and the terms distress of neighboring kangaroos . third a human has to promptly approaches the sedated kangaroo and perform the euthanasia which distresses and disturbs the kangaroo herds often resulting in their thrashing around in distress . <eos>
