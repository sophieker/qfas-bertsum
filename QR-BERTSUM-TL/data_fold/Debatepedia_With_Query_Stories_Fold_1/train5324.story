<s> party strength : do primaries help strengthen the political parties ? <eos>

<s> traditionally the conventions were sources of ideological and policymaking debate for organisations both republican and democrat that are far less pan-national than their european counterparts ( especially when the party concerned is out of power ) . now the conventions are little more than coronation events . as a result policy-making suffers and a party 's position on an important issue may change from election to election depending only upon the personal views of the candidate .

@highlight

<s> the primary process reduces the level of debate at national conventions <eos>
