<s> morals : can assassination be justified on moral terms ? <eos>

<s> by assume the power to taking life arbitrarily even in an supposedly good cause we cheapen the value of life itself . many terrorists murderers or indeed dictators would and have claimed similar legitimacy for their violent actions . only if we ourselves respect human rights absolutely will our promotion of these values seem valid to others . states that use assassinated as a political weapon will soon finding that others seek to turning it against them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legitimizing assassination devalues the values of life . <eos>
