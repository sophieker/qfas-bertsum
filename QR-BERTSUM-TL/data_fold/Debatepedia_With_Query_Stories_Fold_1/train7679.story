<s> corporate responsibility : should government target cigarettes makers ? <eos>

<s> as the proposition points out cigarettes are not dangerous because they are defective ; rather they are inherently potentially harmful . cigarette companies are therefore not failing their consumer by producing cigarettes ; the consumer are getting what they asked for . the individual 's way to choose a certain effect is not being infringed forth as it is when a certain good fails . therfore people should still be allowed to choose to purchase and smoke them .

@highlight

<s> cigarettes are very various from dangerous cars or poisonous foods : <eos>
