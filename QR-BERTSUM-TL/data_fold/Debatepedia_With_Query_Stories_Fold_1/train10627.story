<s> proportionality : were israeli strikes proportional to the hamas attacks ? <eos>

<s> alan dershowitz . `` israel 's policy is perfectly 'proportionate ' '' . wall street journal . january # # - `` the claim that israel has violated the principle of proportionality -- by killing more hamas terrorists than the number of israeli civilians killed by hamas rockets -- is absurd . first there is no legal equivalence between the deliberate killing of innocent civilians and the deliberate killings of hamas combatants . under the laws of war any number of combatants can be killed to prevent the killing of even one innocent civilian . '' <eos>

<s> israel need not be `` proportional '' against hamas terrorist attacks <eos>
