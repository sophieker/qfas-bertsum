<s> animals kill ... is animals testing justified on basis that animals harm one-another too ? <eos>

<s> why should animals be free from obligations and responsibilities toward one-another in the animal kingdom while humans could be obligated by `` animal rights '' to certain responsibilities toward them ? why should humans be disaffected from the natural ordering of the animal kingdom in this way ? the answer is that we should not be and animal rights should not exist . <eos>

@highlight

<s> animal liberties unfairly alienate humans from the natural order . <eos>
