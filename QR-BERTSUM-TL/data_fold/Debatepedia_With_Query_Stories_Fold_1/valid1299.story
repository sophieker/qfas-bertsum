<s> does `` earth hour '' helping the environment ? <eos>

<s> during the hour most those used candles or torches instead of electrical lighting as a source of light . candles are bad for the global warming issue and so are batteries . dead batteries produce carbon emissions and are bad for the environments and global warming . most those who were n't using candles used battery-powered torches and that is still bad for the environment . <eos>
