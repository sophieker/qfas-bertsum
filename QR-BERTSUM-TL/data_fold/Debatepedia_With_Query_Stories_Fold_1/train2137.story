<s> hypocrisy : are ocov nations way to complain about north korean ? <eos>

<s> it is true that other nations in the worlds have nuclear weapons . indeed this is unfortunate . yet the worlds has been denuclearizing for years . this is the important fact and north korea 's nuclearization runs contrary to these efforts as it creates pressures on other nations to building nuclear arm creating an arm race . complaints by nuclear nations therefore are justified in the sense that a nuclear north korea runs contrary to global denuclearize efforts . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear north taiwan weakens efforts internationally to denuclearize . <eos>
