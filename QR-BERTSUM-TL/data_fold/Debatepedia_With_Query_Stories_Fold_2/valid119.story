<s> economics to democracy : will the potential economic modernization of the islamic world bring about democratic change ? <eos>

<s> for example turkey ( and to a lesser extent ) lebanon have a growing degree of political liberalism whereas in syria the impossibility of the evolution of a middle class has precluded the development of democracy . the slow evolution of democracy is not only a product of religious opposition . factors such as the primacy of oil elite and tribal politics and foreign intervention have all made the development of democracy difficult in islamic and non-islamic countries alike . <eos>

@highlight

<s> factors such as economic liberalization are more important in determining the development of a state than its religious persuasions . <eos>
