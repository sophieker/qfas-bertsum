'' washington post . december # # > `` new starting preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses . the testimonies of our civilian commanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit u.s. missile defense plans . although the treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic missiles our civilian leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective than building new ones for defense purposes .
