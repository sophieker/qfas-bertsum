<s> interrogator ali soufan said in an april # op-ed article in the new york times : `` it is inaccurate [ ... ] to say that abu zubaydah had been uncooperative [ and that enhanced interrogation techniques supplies interrogators with initially unobtainable information ] . across with another f.b.i . agent and with numerous c.i.a . officers present i questioned him from marches to june # before the harsh techniques were introduced later in august . under traditional interrogation method he provided us with important measurable intelligence . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight
