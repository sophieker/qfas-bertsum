<s> learning : does performing deprive children of valuable learning experiences such as time-spent on education ? <eos>

<s> in the end education is designed to prepare children for their adult lives and careers . working in a profession like acting or training as a football player may be a better preparation for some children s future than school-based learning . provided they fulfil legal minimum levels of education why shouldn t they start their career early ? after all almost every country allows parents to opt to home-school their children even if they have no teaching qualification . almost all child performers have well-qualified tutors and some child stars go on to achieve high grades in university ( e.g . jodie foster ) .

<s> a bit of work and performance is important for children in giving them a taste of `` real life '' early on . <eos>
