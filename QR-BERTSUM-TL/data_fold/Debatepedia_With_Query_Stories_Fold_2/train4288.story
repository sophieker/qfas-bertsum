<s> economics : is humanitarian aid for the poor economically sound ? <eos>

<s> jens f. laurson & george a. pieler . `` anti-humanitarian aid . '' reason magazine . march 10 2006 : `` western wealth is supposed to speed african development and fight grinding poverty but the result does n't match the intent . in zimbabwe robert mugabe has single-handedly destroyed the economy with western aid flowing . after a quarter-century of mugabe 80 percent of zimbabweans live below the poverty line inflation has soared to triple digits and 'land reform ' subsidized with british 'development support ' takes lives and destroys agriculture . mugabe takes the cash and blames the west trashing the human rights of both large landowners and defenseless slumdwellers in harare . '' <eos>
