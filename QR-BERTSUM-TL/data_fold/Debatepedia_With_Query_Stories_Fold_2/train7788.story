<s> space exploration : is colonizing the moon critical to space exploration/discovery ? <eos>

<s> the energy required to send objects from the moon to space is much less than from earth to space . ease of landing on and launching from the moon makes it an ideal construction site or fueling station for spacecraft . some proposals even include using electric acceleration devices ( mass drivers ) to propel objects off the moon without building rockets . <eos>

@highlight

<s> moonbase would be ideal staging area for space exploration <eos>
