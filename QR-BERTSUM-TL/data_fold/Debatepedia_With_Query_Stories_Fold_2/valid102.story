<s> information : does the attorney-client ensure clients give lawyers the full story ? <eos>

<s> even if a defendant is willing to seek legal advice in the absence of the privilege they will be reluctant to be completely honest with their lawyers for fear that what they say may be used against them later . it is important to realise that even an innocent client may have bad things that he may wish to remain confidential . it is not true that only guilty people will have something to hide . yet to advise a client properly an attorney must have a complete knowledge of the facts including any bad or damaging facts . this gives the lawyer a better understanding of the client s legal liabilities and a better idea of what he will need to answer at <eos>

@highlight

<s> without attorney-client privilege people would not tell their lawyers anything . <eos>
