<s> is it justifiable to give away the national sovereignty of the european states ? <eos>

<s> some claim that the eu has reached the effective extent of its capability to enlarge - with most eastern european states outside the eu being entirely mostly or partially russian-oriented in their policy ( belarus ukraine ... ) or considered ( by some ) un-european such as turkey israel and the caucus or balkan nations . the only way to for the eu to develop would be to deepen . <eos>

@highlight

<s> enlargement is too far already . <eos>
