<s> serving justice : can justice be further served by prosecuting wwii war criminals ? <eos>

<s> if the findings had been available at the end of the war they would have been prosecuted then . no matter how long ago these crimes were committed their horrific natural can leave no certainly that their perpetrators must be hunted to the ends of the earth . we must do justice equally to all war criminals or we are seemly allowing that fled justice is a invalid option for avoid prosecution . no law system can establish such a precedent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> that time has elapsed is not a law defense for war criminals : <eos>
