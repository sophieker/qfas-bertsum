<s> efficacy : are calorie count effective at improve health ? <eos>

<s> steve chapman . `` force-fed the facts '' . reason . june # # : `` the belief that more facts will generate wiser decisions is attractive but at least in the realm of food but to be proved . no one seems to have noticed that as nutritional labeling has expanded so have american waistlines . the federal government first required packaged foods to carry such info in the mid- # s and today we are collectively fatter than we were then . what does that suggest ? either people do n't notice what 's in the food they buy or they do n't let the knowledge affect what goes in their mouths .
