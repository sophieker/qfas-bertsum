<s> due dessert ? does plead negotiations in exchange for testimony violate the notion of due dessert ? <eos>

<s> this notions holds that specific crimes and circumstances should lead to or deserve specific punishments . only when due desert is applied can it be said that justice is served . plead bargaining reaches settlement that are not an exacting measure of what a criminal deserves but merely of what can be satisfactorily agreed upon between the prosecutor and defendant . the punishment falling somewhere in the middle of these parties instead of on a place of due desert and justice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> plead bargaining violates the legal notion of due desert : <eos>
