<s> emissions : can hybrid vehicles significantly reduce greenhouse emissions ? <eos>

<s> kelly cunningham . `` the case against hybrid cars '' - `` to understand the hybrid truly you must observe it 's manufacture from start to finish . to make the massive batteries found in the typical hybrid nickel must be smelted- the fumes and byproducts and waste produced in the initial smelt is massive . the area in ontario where the initial smelting for the nissan prius battery occurs has become barren and disfigured and lifeless in the less than two decades that the smelting plant has been situated there ... just the shipping involved in the early life of a hybrid batteries is horribly pollutive- oil-powered ships cargo planes and deisel trucks all over the world constantly run devoted to the tasks of making more ecologically sound <eos>
