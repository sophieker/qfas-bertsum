<s> economics : is sending more troops to afghanistan economically sound ? <eos>

<s> whenever there is a steadily escalation of war in which more troops are sent and more resources expended the so known `` military industrial complex '' of military contractors profits greatly . and definitely this complex is lobbying for such an escalation for this reason . the public should always be skeptical therefore about the motivations surrounding the escalation of war . yet even if this `` complex '' is not driving the thinking and decision-making on sending more troops to afghanistan it is important to simply raise the points that the good taxpayer expenditures on the war on making a good number of military contractors very wealthy . this is a moral hazard . <eos>
