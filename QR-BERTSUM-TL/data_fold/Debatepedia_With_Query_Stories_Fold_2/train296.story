<s> nonproliferation : could the ntbt helping with non-proliferation efforts ? <eos>

<s> the utopian model suggested by the comprehensive test ban treaties that it will prevent nuclear war and hazards by stopping nuclear testing is fallacious primarily because fears of nuclear arsenals will continue which be lead to wars similar to the war in iraq just to see whether a country has nuclear weapons or not . such fear of countries ' nuclear capabilities will continue to cause conflict even if nations are unable to test their nuclear capabilities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> fear will causes nuclear proliferating despite testing ban . <eos>
