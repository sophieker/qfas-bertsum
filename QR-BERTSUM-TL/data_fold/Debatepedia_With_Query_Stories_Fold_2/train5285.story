<s> targeted assassinations : is it appropriate to assassinate terrorist leaders ? <eos>

<s> steven r. david . `` fatal choices : israel 's policy of targeted killing '' . john hopkins university . september 2002 . - `` insofar as israel erodes the norm of assassination it transforms the rules of conflict in a manner that benefits its most fervent adversaries . it is of course true that norms do not determine behavior . terrorists almost by definition are not constrained by established norms . the long history of plane hijackings and other murderous attacks against innocent civilians by terrorists throughout the world gives brutal testimony to their willingness to violate established codes of conduct . in confronting this challenge states have also had to depart from usual norms . terrorists typically do not appear in identifiable uniforms or hold clear swaths of territory making conventional responses <eos>
