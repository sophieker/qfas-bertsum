<s> responsible marketplace : can the marketplace be regulated properly ? <eos>

<s> legalisation of the sale of organs will eliminate the corruption that has led to reported executions and thefts of organs . a successful transplant operation is dependent upon knowledge of certain characteristics of the donor . therefore the origin of the organ must be known . the black market can not be regulated but its purpose would be defeated once the sale of organs became lawful .

@highlight

<s> the legalization of an organ marketplace would close organ trading black markets and open the door for broader oversight . <eos>
