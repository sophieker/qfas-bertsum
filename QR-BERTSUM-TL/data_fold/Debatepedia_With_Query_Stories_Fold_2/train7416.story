<s> morality : is drug-use morally acceptable or tolerable ? <eos>

<s> humans perceive the world how they do for a specific reason ; god or nature determined it is the way human are supposed to perceive the world . to attempt to diverge from this natural god-given perception of the world is to diverge from the intended course of human-perception . this divergence is morally repugnant . it is also symptomatic of a desire to pursue more than what god or nature has naturally given to us . this culture of `` more more more '' is morally wrong . we should be content with our natural mental state and have the discipline to eliminate eliminate any discontentment with that state-of-mind without resorting to drug-use . <eos>

@highlight

<s> attempting to alter with drug-use the god-given human state-of-mind is immoral . <eos>
