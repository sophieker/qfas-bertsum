<s> religion : is the ban tolerant/respectful of the muslim faith ? <eos>

<s> this ban proves tablibans were way because if law makers can frames this bill ordering / influencing people not to wear the veil then why do n't they covering the body as well . if their logical can overrule personal freedom / lives style of individuals then why ca n't their local traditions force people to dress in their prefered fashion ? if they expel on wearing scarf why do n't they charge people for wearing certaining styles ? we must forget that veil are not only limited to islam or muslim world but apart of formal dressing of royal nobles knights elite and dignities in europe for centuries having rooted in churches as well . scarf was purely part of european dressing . <eos>
