<s> economics - does tourism benefit hosting economies ? <eos>

<s> international tourism in particular may increase short-term returns but at the cost of a dependence on the vagaries of fashions . a single climatic disaster such as a hurricane or a crime wave ( as in south africa ) or terrorist attack ( such as that at luxor in # where # tourists were attacked ) will mean the market quickly collapses . [ # ] even without this changing trends will mean tourist tastes shift every few years . <eos>
