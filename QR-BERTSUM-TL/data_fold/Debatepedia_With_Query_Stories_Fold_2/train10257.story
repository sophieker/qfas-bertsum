<s> social welfare : should migrants receive equals treatment on social welfare ? <eos>

<s> while it may be acceptable for migrant to receive certain social services while working in a country too of a nation 's social services should be made unavailable to them . social security and medicaid for example are based on individuals paying into the system for year and thus having a legitimately claim to draw from the programs in their time of need . migrant workers fall outside this equation so should not have the same rights to these benefit as full citizens . <eos>

@highlight

<s> complete entitlements should be rights for the citizens of a nation . <eos>
