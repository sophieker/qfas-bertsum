<s> editor-experience : is wiki clean for its editors ? <eos>

<s> - wikipedians do n't try to own the additions they make to wikipedia . they are working them on statements of what is known ( what constitutes free human knowledge ) about various subjects . each of us individually benefits from this arrangement . it is difficult to write the perfect article single-handedly but it becomes easier when working together . hence the saying `` many hands gives light work . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> wiki is not for individual poetic but superior collective knowledge . <eos>
