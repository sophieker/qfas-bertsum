<s> vandalism : does wiki handle vandals adequately ? <eos>

<s> while most instances of pages blanking or the addition of offensive material are soon reverting less obvious vandalism has remained for longer periods . for example a user making several racist edits to martin luther king jr. day that were not reverting for nearly four hours . [ # ] columnist sujay kumar commented : `` while wikipedia says that most vandal edits are removed within five minutes some falsities have managed to going unnoticed . an outrageously fake entry about larry king 's uncontrollable flatulence was posted for a month . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> those thefts on wikipedia are not correcting for months <eos>
