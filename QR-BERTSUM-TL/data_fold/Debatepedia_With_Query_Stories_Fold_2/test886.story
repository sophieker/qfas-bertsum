<s> moon-to-mars : would a moon landing aid an eventual mission to mars ? <eos>

<s> when we decided to go to the moon in the # s and # s we had progressive systems that allowed the building upon knowledge gradually as time went on missions by mission . the unfortunate thing is that we have not been to the moon or attempting anything like that in a little under half a century . we have lost the progression chain and have only done orbiting and satellite repair/launch for the past few decades . we need to restart the chain with another moon landing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> progressive systems could be refined by one moon landing . <eos>
