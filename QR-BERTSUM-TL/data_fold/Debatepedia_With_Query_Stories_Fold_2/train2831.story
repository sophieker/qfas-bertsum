<s> governments legitimacy : does governments have legitimately jurisdiction to censor rap ? <eos>

<s> even if one accept the argument for some limited form of government censorship to protect public morals this need to be very precisely and conservatively defined to avoid the slippery slope towards creeps totalitarianism . allowing censorship of popular culture on grounds that the lyrics are mildly subversive is unwelcome as it incorporates a very expansive view of the proper ambit of government regulation . this issue is correctly the concern of parents who should take more interest in and responsibilities for the music ( and films tv internet use ) to which their children are exposed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> government censorship is a danger form of statist control . <eos>
