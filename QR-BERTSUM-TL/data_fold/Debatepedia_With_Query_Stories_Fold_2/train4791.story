<s> photovoltaic power : is photovoltaic power a viable option ? <eos>

<s> not only is the technology itself costly but also the operation cost are high and the sunlight does not shine all the time . moreover with current solar cell technology only about # % of the electricity absorbed into the solar panel is output as usable electricity . this coupling with the expense of solar technology makes it very costly to create a system that produces much electricity to be useful in daily life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> solar powers is inefficient . <eos>
