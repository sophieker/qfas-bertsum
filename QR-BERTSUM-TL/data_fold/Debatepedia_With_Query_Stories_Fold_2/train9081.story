<s> as above research into animal ( when it respects their rights and is not cruel or harmful ) may be valuable but it does not need to happen in the context of confinement and human entertainment . also the only ways really to understand other species is to study them in their natural habitat and see how they interact culturally and with other species of flora and fauna . <eos>

@highlight

<s> animal studies does not want to be conducted in confinement . <eos>
