<s> alternatives : are there no good alternatives to abolishing the veto ? <eos>

<s> while one way to `` level the playing field '' is to offer the veto to more countries that `` deserve '' it according to their geopolitical standing the problem is that this risks increasing the instances in which the veto is used and in which resolutions are blocked by the national agendas of countries . it is better to `` level the playing field '' therefore by moving in the other direction by banning the veto . <eos>

@highlight

<s> extending un sc veto to more countries would reduce un effectiveness <eos>
