<s> tibet itself acknowledged chinese sovereignty by sending delegates to the drafting committee for a new constitution of the republic of china in 1925 ; to the national assembly of the republic of china in 1931 ; to the fourth national congress of the kuomintang in 1931 ; to a national assembly for drafting a new chinese constitution in 1946 ; and to another national assembly for drafting a new chinese constitution in 1948. it would not have done so if it was an independent country . <eos>
