<s> pakistani people : would the pakistani people react negatively ? <eos>

<s> the reason for this is that the talibinization of the northwestern frontier has constrained basic liberties . in some areas mullahs are refusing to allow men to shave their beards by threatening barbers . the strict fundamentalist extension of islamic code is not one supported by mainstream pakistanis . thus so long as unilateral strikes are implemented in a way that guarantees the limit of bystander casualties and so long as intelligence is actionable to the extent that real threats are addressed action would be justified in the pakistani lens . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the pakistani people would view unilateral strikes in a good light . <eos>
