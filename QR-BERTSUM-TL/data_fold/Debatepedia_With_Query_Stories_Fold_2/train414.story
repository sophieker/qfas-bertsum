<s> abuse : would legal prostitution experience less violence ? <eos>

<s> by legalizing prostitution a government can help bring these laborers under labor protections offered to other workers . some claim that prostitution is inherently unsafe and so should not be sanctioned by labor laws but many other industries are unsafe such as the mining industry and this was precisely the reason why government labor laws and unions were created to help protect them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> prostitutes are vulnerable because they lack labor protections <eos>
