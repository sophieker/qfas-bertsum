<s> location : does photovoltaic electricity have locational benefits ? <eos>

<s> deposits of varying kind can collecting on solar panels and reduce the amount of sunlight that can be converted into energy . heavy rain in some regions for example containing large amounts of calcium which can build up over time on solar panels into a white dough that can substantially obstruct the amount of light that entering the solar panel and that is converted into energy . this means that solar panels must be constantly cleaned which is a hassle as well as costly . <eos>
