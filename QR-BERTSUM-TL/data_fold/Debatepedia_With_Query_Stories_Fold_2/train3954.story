<s> drug use : would decriminalization increase drug use ? <eos>

<s> a national institute on drug abuse brochure entitled `` marijuana : facts for teens '' states `` using marijuana puts children and teens in contact with people who are user and sellers of other drugs . so there is more of a risk that a marijuana user will be exposed to and urged to trying more drugs . `` [ # ] there is no evidence marijuana usage leads to subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs . however if this is true then completely legalizing marijuana to allow the regulated sale of marijuana would increase the chance that marijuana user would `` be exposed to and urged to trying more drugs . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> decriminalization could reduce possible the abuse of other illicit drugs . <eos>
