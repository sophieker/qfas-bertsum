<s> health : is the colonization of the moon healthy for humans ? <eos>

<s> `` why the moon will never be colonized . '' phil for humanity : `` the bigger problem with colonizing the moon is the effects that low gravity will have on children . the human development process has evolved perfectly with earth s high gravity . on the moon children would most likely develop severe and possibly fatal deformities under low gravity . for instance their bones would be extremely brittle and break often . their hearts would be very weak and never fully develop as well as possibly all of their other muscles too . children would literally grow to extreme heights that will cause severe complications on the spinal cord and digestive systems because these organs have limited stretching capabilities . as a result colonists on the moon <eos>
