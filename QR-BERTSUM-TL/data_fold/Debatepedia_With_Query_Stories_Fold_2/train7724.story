<s> international law and realities : is the we policy here an infringement of international law that should be fought ? <eos>

<s> members of the un are obligated by treaty to contribute . in fact ten nations ( all in africa central asia or the caribbean ) are being threatened with the loss of their general assembly votes for arrears this either . these states are required to make far smaller contributions in total than the gap sometimes left unfilled by the usa . while the us does eventually contribute its dues and the un voluntarily comply with its demand to keeping a level budget the threats they hold over the un is essentially a breach of treaty .

@highlight

<s> non-payment of dues is an infringement of international law : <eos>
