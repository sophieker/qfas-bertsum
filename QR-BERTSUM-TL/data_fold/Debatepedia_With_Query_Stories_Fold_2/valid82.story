<s> renewable : is geothermal a `` renewable '' resource ? <eos>

<s> geothermal is a renewables energy resource . it derives energy from the heat of the earth 's core and volcanic-thermal activity . the earth 's core will continue to produce massive amount of heat for millions of years . humans can tap this energy by pumping out super-hot water heated thousands of feet inside the earth 's crust . this supply of super-hot water will never run out as long as it is managed properly allow it to be sufficiently replenish by rain-water drains back into the earth 's crust . <eos>

@highlight

<s> geothermal electricity is a renewables resource when managed properly . <eos>
