<s> self-respect of life : does abortions uphold the `` dignity of life '' ? <eos>

<s> it is clear that the notions of `` the right to life '' can sometimes be violated for particular ends . this is the case in sending soldiers to war . so as in abortion it can be justified to killing a fetus under particular circumstances . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no inviolate `` right to life '' in abortion and other cases . <eos>
