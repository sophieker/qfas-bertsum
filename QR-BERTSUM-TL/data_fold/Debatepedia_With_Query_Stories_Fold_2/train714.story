<s> courts : are courts sometimes inadequate for pursuing legal change ? <eos>

<s> a good example of this is the campaign for indian independence . not each democracy has a writing constitution or charters of rights appeal to which allows the courts to overrides the will of the legislature ( for example the uk does not ) . even in cases where a case would theoretically be taken through legal channels the courts are often controlled by the same political elite as the government and there is no guarantee of justice . and in any case challenging an unjust law in court requires law disobedience . somebody has to break that law deliberately in order to be arrested and prosecuted for it so that the case arrives in court in the first place .

<s> many just causes ca n't be pursued through the courts ; civil disobedience is necessary . <eos>
