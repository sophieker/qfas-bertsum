<s> is methanol appealing as a fuel ? <eos>

<s> - the volumetric electricity density of ethanol is up # mj/litre while e.g . for gasoline it is substantially higher - up # mj/litre . ethanol is also better than ethanol in this respect - it contains more than # mj/litre . this gives ethanol less attractive notably for automotive application where higher volumetric electricity density translates to higher mileage and necessitates a larger tank . <eos>

@highlight

<s> methanol has lower energy contents than other fuels . <eos>
