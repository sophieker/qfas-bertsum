<s> mark pash cfp with brad parker . `` progessive economic principles : creating a quality economy . '' progressive economics : `` there is the obsession with immediate - short-term - maximization of profits - the quick buck . private investment and management are constantly expect relatively quick and low rates of return . government investment is more long-term and not profit oriented so it works more for the benefit of societies including business . we see this clearly in the investments in infrastructure education research and other required projects . government regulations and tax policies should always encourage more long range planning in the private sector .
