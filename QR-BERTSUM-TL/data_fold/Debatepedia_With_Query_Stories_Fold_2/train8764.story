<s> independence : can journalism remain independant while receive subsidies ? <eos>

<s> declan mccullagh . `` should you be taxed to subsidize 'the new york times ' ? '' . cnet . september # # - `` one argument for tax subsidies and the vancouver journalism review article invokes it at length is that newspapers ' 'role of informing citizens is crucial to democracy ' through aggressive reporting on governments malfeasance . but supporting that kind of aggressive reporting it seems to me is the worst argument for governments funding -- it would be the first type of reporting killed openly or covertly when the inevitable political pressure is brought to bear . ( i wonder if i 'd even be prohibited to write this commentary if my salary were paid by the government . and would a taxpayer-subsidized newspapers ever publishing an editorial calling for lower taxes ? ) '' <eos>
