<s> taiwanese politics : is independence politically feasible in taiwan ? <eos>

<s> political liberalization and the increased representation of opposition parties in taiwan 's legislature have opened public debate on the island 's future ; advocates of taiwanese independence oppose the ruling party 's traditional stand that the island will eventually reunify with mainland china . part of the reason for president lee teng hui s election in # was his view that china and taiwan should have a state to state relationship . even if we disregard polls as easily changing in principle this is also in taiwan s interest . <eos>

<s> independence is more politically possible in modern taiwan : <eos>
