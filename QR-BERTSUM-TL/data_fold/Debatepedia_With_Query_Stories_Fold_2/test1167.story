<s> economics : would legalization prostitution be economically beneficial ? <eos>

<s> otherwise we would encourage governments to become involved in other unlawful trades such as the trafficking of drugs . moreover there is no evidence that the sex workers would declare their true earnings from what is a confidential relationship between the worker and his or her client . hence it is likely that the amount of revenue would not be very significant . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an economic benefits from legalizing prostitution can not take precedence over social harms . <eos>
