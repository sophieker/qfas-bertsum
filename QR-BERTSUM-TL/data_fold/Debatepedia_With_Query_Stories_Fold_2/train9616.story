<s> feasibility : is it feasible to equalize pay between men and women ? <eos>

<s> it is not really fair that tournaments in which both sexes ( separately ) compete such as wimbledon are singled out for campaign for equality as different levels of popularity and physical abilities has resulted in this differentiation across all major sports such as soccer rugby cricket basketball baseball . there is a danger that sports administrators will decide the best way to avoid forced equality is to scrapping joint tournaments in which men and women compete at the same time in parallel competitions . this could have the unintended consequence of reducing the opportunities for women to compete at the top levels and so to earn the highest financial rewards .

@highlight

<s> equal-pay campaigns are preferentially discriminatory and risks causing a uproar against joint tournaments that will harm female pay : <eos>
