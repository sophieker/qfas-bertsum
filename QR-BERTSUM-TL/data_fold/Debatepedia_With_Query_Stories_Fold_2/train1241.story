<s> and death penalty : how can those be anti-abortion but pro death penalty ? <eos>

<s> there is no contradiction between opposing abortions and supporting investment punishment as those conservatives do . an abortion involves killing an innocent fetus whereas investment punishment involves killing a guilty terrible human being . one involves killing an fetus baby with the potential to contribute positively to society the other kills a human being that has demonstrated themselves unfit to live in society . the real inconsistency is in supporting abortion while opposing investment punishment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an abortions kills innocents ; capital punishment kills the guilty <eos>
