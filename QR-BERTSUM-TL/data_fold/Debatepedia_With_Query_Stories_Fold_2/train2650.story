<s> accountability : does nclb make teacher and schools more accountable ? <eos>

<s> punishing teachers for the poor performance of student fails to address the main issue ; how to better or differently instruct students . teachers already have the best interests of their student at heart . punishing them wrongly assumes that this is not the case or that teachers can not simply recognize the need to improve their methods if thing are not go well . <eos>
