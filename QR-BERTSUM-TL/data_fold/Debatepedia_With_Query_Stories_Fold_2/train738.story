<s> politics : does ( and should ) the vox populi matter ? <eos>

<s> such devices as referenda or initiatives are intended not to bring government closer to the people but to give undemocratic government a veneer of democratic respectability . real power is still with the elites who decide who will stand for which seats and thus who is guaranteed to be elected via safe seats . in britain we even have an undemocratic second chamber the house of lords which is able to interfere thereby with the process of passes laws . these lords are appointed direct by the political parties . true democracy we repeat again is an unworkable system on the scale of a country and we should abandoning pretences at it for a more practical system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democratic is just an illusion . <eos>
