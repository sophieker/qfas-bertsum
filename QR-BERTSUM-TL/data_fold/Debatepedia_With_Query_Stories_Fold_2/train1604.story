<s> punishment : is it wrong to punish prisoners by depriving vote ? <eos>

<s> surely we should punish criminals . but depriving prisoners of the right to vote goes beyond reasonable punishment ( physical imprisonment itself is very hard on a person ) and into the realm of mean spiritedness . particularly in societies where rehabilitation is an objective such mean spiritedness is counter-productive . <eos>

@highlight

<s> depriving prisoners of a vote is simply mean spirited . <eos>
