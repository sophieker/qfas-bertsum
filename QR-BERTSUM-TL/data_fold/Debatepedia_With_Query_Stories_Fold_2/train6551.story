'' . washington post . august # # - `` to condemn millions to eternal political silence is to stab our democracy in the heart and to provide cause for bitterness and alienation . felons be face many other disabilities : they can not sit on juries serve as teachers firefighters or -- often -- even barbers or plumbers . they can not receive food stamp or live in public housing . add to all this the understanding that whatever they do no matter how much they have changed their voices will never be heard in the public arena .
