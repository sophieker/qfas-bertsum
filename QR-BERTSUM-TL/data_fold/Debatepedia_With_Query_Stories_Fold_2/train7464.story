<s> private opinion : does private opinion favors or oppose the bailout ? does it matter ? <eos>

<s> government may lack credibility among the public . yet this public perception has no relation to the actual capacity of government to solve economic problems . the $ # bailout plan provided a good means to solving the economic crisis . it should have been adopt irrespective of public perception . furthermore congressmen that voted against a bailout plan obviously can not rely on the argument that the those `` do n't trust us '' to justify their `` no '' vote . <eos>

@highlight

<s> leaders crises is only worsened by not passing $ # b plan <eos>
