<s> history : were palestinians forced out or fled on own will ? <eos>

<s> israeli official sources overseas press and officials present at the time and historians such as joseph schechtman have long claimed that the # refugee crisis was incited by the invading arab army who ordered palestinian civilians to evacuate the battle zone . opponents of the right of returns such as efraim karsh say that israel is thus not obligated to compensate palestinians or allow them to return . israel officially denies any responsibility for the palestinian exodus stated that their flight was caused by the arab invasion . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arabs instigated # / # wars ; no pal . right of return . <eos>
