<s> convenience : would identity cards be more or less convenient than the status quo ? <eos>

<s> - including presumably at the beach while dancing at a club while exercising etc . yet failure to produce a card when asked could land perfectly innocent people in trouble with the authorities . perhaps worse losing a card which represents your entire existence ( driving licence welfare card health insurance card etc . all in one ) would create a great deal of trouble . finally from what age should cards be issued ; are five year-old children to be required to carry them and keep them safe at school and in the playground ? furthermore a requirement to carry an identity card at all times can lead to the inconvenience of arbitrary requests from card controllers ( such as the police ) . this can lead to functionality creep <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is unreasonable to expect people to carry a specific card on their person at all times <eos>
