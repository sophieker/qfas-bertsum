<s> security : are international secure courts for sanctioning cuba unfounded ? <eos>

<s> the initial purpose of sanctioning cuba was to constrain the broader threat of the soviet union following castro 's coming of powers and the initiation of relations between the two countries . indeed cuba was a significant threat to the united states and international security at that time as a proxy of the soviet union during the cold war . but after the cold war last cuba became a far lower-level threat as it ceased to be a proxy country of the soviet union . sanction being leveled against cuba in the cold war contexts are therefore no longer reasonably as cuba no longer presents the same threat to the united states and the world . <eos>
