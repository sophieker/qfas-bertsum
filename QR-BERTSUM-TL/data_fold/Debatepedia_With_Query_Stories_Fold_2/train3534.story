<s> exploitation : is it ok to exploit fish and subject them to physical pain ? <eos>

<s> god did not give humans unbridled dominion over animals . rather humans dominion over animals is too like god 's dominion over humans ; it is a caring nurturing parent-like relationship . it is not a tyrannical do-what-we-want kind of a relationship . therefore fish-farming must be sensitively in-tune with this humans care-taker dominion over animals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` dominion '' makes humans stewards ; no way to harm/exploit animal <eos>
