<s> assisting quiting : would a ban help smokers quit ? <eos>

<s> a ban would encourage smokers to smoke less or give up . if smoking was banned in public places it would no longer be a social activity . instead smokers would have to leave their friends inside and go outside to smoke . this would be particularly unpleasant when it is cold or wet . one third of smokers in scotland said the ban was helping them to cut down . if smoking was a less social activity fewer people would start smoking . in many countries governments pay all or some of the cost of treating smoking-related diseases . this means that governments should have a right to discourage smoking . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a smoking ban in public places alienates smokers and incentivizes quiting . <eos>
