<s> family reunification : should a right to family reunification exist ? <eos>

<s> states have leveled as an argument against the migrant workers convention and against other possible international migrant treaties concerns about a robust right of family reunification to all migrant workers present in migrant-receiving countries . this could offer family members a right to migrate into the state in question resulting in large increases in population size . and there is no doubt that the text of the migrant workers convention aims to create a `` right '' to family reunification . even if it provides flexibility on how a nation attempts to facilitate re-unification it still requires that states reunite families in some way . under this treaty therefore any migrant could sue the state for not allowing their family ( and perhaps extended family ) to immigrate <eos>

<s> family reunification right is obstacle to migrant rights treaty . <eos>
