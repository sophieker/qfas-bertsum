<s> james carafano of the heritage foundations believes that `` there are no great civilian options . when you re trying to stabilise iraq and you ve got this long borders between iranian and iraq and you re trying to keep the iraqis from interfere in iraq so you can get the iraq governments up and running you shouldn t be picking a war with the iranians . it just doesn t make any sense from a geopolitical standpoint . '' <eos>
