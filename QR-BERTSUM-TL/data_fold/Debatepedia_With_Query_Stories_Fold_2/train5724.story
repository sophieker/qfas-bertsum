<s> states : is a national standard better than state standards ? <eos>

<s> karen kerrigan . `` commentary : renewable energy legislation would add to drain on small business . '' washington post . july 26th 2010 : `` a federal renewable energy mandate would require that a percentage of a state 's energy be produced from `` renewable '' sources . the federal government would arbitrarily decide what sources are considered 'renewable . ' the mandate does not take geography into account and fails to consider that many states do not have access to affordable renewable energy sources . this means the legislation is inequitable ; it will punish small-business owners in states where renewable sources are limited . '' <eos>

<s> national standard punishes states with less renewable energy <eos>
