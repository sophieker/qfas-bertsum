<s> compromise : was `` do n't ask do n't tell '' a needed compromise ? <eos>

<s> `` do n't ask do n't tell '' was crafted in the early # s when the country and the military were deeply divided as to whether gays should be allowed to serve openly in the military . the country remains deeply divided on this question . `` do n't ask do n't tell '' strikes an appropriate compromise in this divided environment avoiding overt approval of homosexuality in the military while accommodating it . <eos>

<s> `` do n't ask do n't tell '' is a necessary compromise in a divided country . <eos>
