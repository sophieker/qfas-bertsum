<s> governance : can nations do a better job of govern water resources ? <eos>

<s> it is not clear how the governance of a global commons of water resources might proceed . who would decide how water resources can be used ? what democratic processes would be employed ? nation-state today typically have adequate democratic processes and administrative structures to manage and govern the distribution of water . as democracies the voice of the people can be clearly expressed in votes and other but defined avenues . it is not clear how such citizen-participation in the governance of water resources would occur in a global commons . the nation-state also generally has a strong decisionmaking structures with a head-of-state that is valuable in responding to crises such as a drought . the global commons lacks such a structure . <eos>
