<s> serving justice : can justice be further served by prosecuting wwii war criminals ? <eos>

<s> wwii was so long ago that these individuals were usually very young and of high rank . they be have had not choice in committing war crimes . if they had resisted they probably would have been killed so in effects they performed these acts under duress . they were also frequently not german add to the consideration that they ca n't be held fully responsible . most of the major figures responsibility for atrocities are now dead . for this reason there is little remaining potential for justice to be furthered . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nazis war criminals uncovered now were usually just following orders and so they are n't fully responsible for their acts : <eos>
