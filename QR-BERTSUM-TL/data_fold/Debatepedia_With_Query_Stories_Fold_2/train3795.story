<s> regulation : can punishments punishment be properly regulated ? <eos>

<s> corporal punishment must be used as part of a wider strategy and at the correct time : when other immediate discipline has failed ; when the child knows their behavior and has had an opportunity to understand it ; and after an initial warning and opportunity for the child to repent . vitally the person delivering the punishment must not be angry at the time . this undermines much of the hysterical arguments against corporal punishment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> corporal punishment can be regulated within methodical framework . <eos>
