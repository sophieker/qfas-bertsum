<s> crime : does capital punishment help protecting the private and deter crime ? <eos>

<s> when the death penalty is a # % assured punishments for certain crimes it has a strong deter effect . when it is a possible `` maybe '' punishments it has a much less certain deter effect . in the united states few states have established capital punishments as a # % certain punishments with it generally being a very rare and arbitrary practice . this is one of the reasons why its deter effect is unclear in the states and why us-focused studies ( used frequently by pro-death penalty advocates ) are less credible in determining the real deter effect of capital punishment . look to cases around the world where it is a certainty show a closer causality between capital punishments and crime-deterrence . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the death penalty deters crime only if it is a expectation <eos>
