<s> non-experts : is it valuable or bad that non-experts can edit on wikipedia ? <eos>

<s> jaron lanier digital maoism - `` the hive mind is for the most part stupid and boring . why pay attention to it ? the problem is in the way the wikipedia has come to be regarded and used ; how it 's been elevated to such importance so quickly . and that is part of the larger pattern of the appeal of a new online collectivism that is nothing less than a resurgence of the idea that the collective is all-wise that it is desirable to have influence concentrated in a bottleneck that can channel the collective with the most verity and force . this is different from representative democracy or meritocracy . this idea has had dreadful consequences when thrust upon us from the extreme right <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia 's collectivism produces mediocre information <eos>
