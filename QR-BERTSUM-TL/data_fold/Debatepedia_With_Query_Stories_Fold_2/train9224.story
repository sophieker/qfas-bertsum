<s> rights : are israeli settlements consistent with israeli and palestinian rights ? <eos>

<s> daniel kaganovich and michael butler . `` why we supporting israeli settlements '' . jewish magazine . march # . : `` the phrase 'settlement ' itself has acquired negative connotations and when used in the unfamiliar formula 'israeli settlements on arabic land ' automatically concedes the superiority of the arabic claim to the west bank . we do not concede this claim ; neither does the state of israel . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> israelis have equals claim as palestinians to settle in west bank <eos>
