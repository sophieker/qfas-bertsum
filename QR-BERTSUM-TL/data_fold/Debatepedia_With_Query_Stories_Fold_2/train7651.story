<s> we will be expected to carry a card at all times -- even on the beach or while exercising or in a nightclub . and if we can t show one when asked we will be punished . there is also a real danger that government powers will be abused . in many nations where identity cards have to be carrying and shown on request the police use this as an excuses to harass members of ethnic minorities .
