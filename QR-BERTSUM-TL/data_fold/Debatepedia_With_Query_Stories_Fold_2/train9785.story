<s> sustainability : is means testing better than universally access ? <eos>

<s> at particular universal access gives the middle classes a stake in a society system and makes them more willing to pay the taxes that are needed to support it . means testing will shifts most of the benefits to the poorest segments of society who are often the least politically active and even more unable to represent themselves effectively in politics . whenever a government feels the urge to cut spending it will be much easier to reducing means tested benefits than universal entitlements . means testing will result in fewer benefits for the poor . <eos>

@highlight

<s> meaning testing will not receive the crucial public support that universal access wields : <eos>
