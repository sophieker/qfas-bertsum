<s> pain : do animal experiences very bit or no pain ? <eos>

<s> many forms of animal testing do not inflict any pain on the animal . they may merely study the effects of a mild drug on an animal or merely test brain activity no cutting or harming an animal in any way . in consideration of this fact it is inappropriate to call for abandoning all forms of animal testing . certainly there is no need to abandon the forms of animal testing that do no harm to animals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is a misconception that all animals test involve pain . <eos>
