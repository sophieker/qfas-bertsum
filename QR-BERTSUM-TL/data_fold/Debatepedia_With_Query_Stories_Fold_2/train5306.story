<s> terms history : are tibet 's terms historical claims to independence justified ? <eos>

<s> many countries have close ties and even assist another another militarily . but this does not equate to a history of sovereignty control . `` tibet and china : two distinctive views '' . rangzen.org . retrieved # . # . # - `` during the manchu rule ( # - # ) the qing army was asked by tibetans to settle disputes . but this does not support china 's right to tibet . if it did then the u.s.a. should claim kuwait and honduras since it assisted these countries . in fact on a number of occasion tibet exercised power over china suggesting that perhaps tibet should claim china ! '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> a history of blunted and military assistance does not equate to chinese sovereignty . <eos>
