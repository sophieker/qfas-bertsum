<s> drunk driving : is banning alcohol importance to preventing drunk driving ? <eos>

<s> we should continue to campaign against it and have every reason to hope that the current trend towards its eradication by a process of attitude-change and stigmatisation will continue . the fact that there are but some injuries and deaths is not a good much reason to taking out the law liberties of the vast majority of law-abiding citizens by depriving them of the pleasure of drinking alcohol . <eos>

@highlight

<s> recent progressing against drunk driving has been encouraging . <eos>
