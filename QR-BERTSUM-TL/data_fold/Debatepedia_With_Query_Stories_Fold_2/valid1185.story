<s> school : is it specific to bans head scarves in public schools ? <eos>

<s> it is potentially divisive in the classroom marking some child out as various from the others and above the rules that the schools enforce for everyone else . this may lead to disillusionment and bullying . full headscarves may also be impractical or dangerous in some lessons for instance pe swimming or in technology and science lessons where machinery is being operated . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the hijab cause problems in schools such as division and alienation . <eos>
