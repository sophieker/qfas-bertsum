<s> insurgency fight : is the us presence failing to combat the insurgency there ? <eos>

<s> some argue that a us withdrawal would eliminate the cause celebre of the insurgency . yet insurgents are fighting the iraqi government as much as they are fighting foreign troops in the country . if foreign troops withdraw insurgents will simply focus their fight against the iraqi government with the end-goal of unseating the government and seizing power . <eos>

@highlight

<s> following a withdrawal insurgents would attack the iraqi government and troops . <eos>
