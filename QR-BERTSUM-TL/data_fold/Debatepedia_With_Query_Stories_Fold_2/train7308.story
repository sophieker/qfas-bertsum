<s> markets prices : do markets prices make sense ? <eos>

<s> market prices do not include any costs to third parties including anything from individual those all the ways up to the ecosystem as a whole ( these are called externalities ) . these costs could be negative such as pollution or positive such as pollution cleanup . negative externalities are overproduced ( on a scale of what is socially acceptable ) and positive externalities are underproduced - since precise prices would making action with negative externalities more expensive and action with positive externalities cheaper meaning more positive externalities would be produced and less negative externalities ( it would about approximate the social cost ) . that would be precise pricing . but social costs are excluded from pricing in the capitalism market ( they affect a third party ) so it is <eos>

@highlight

<s> market price do not reflect social cost <eos>
