<s> privacy : does nationalisation help or hurt own privacy ? <eos>

<s> it is an odd argument that government can not be trusted with one 's private information . are private banks supposed to be more trustworthy ? private banks have a direct profit-interest in utilizing private information to further their profits . the government does not have this interest . both are constrained by law protecting individual freedom . but banks have a more perverse interests to utilize information in nefarious way to expand their profits . between the two alternative of government and access/assess control of this information government control through nationalization should be of lesser concern . <eos>

@highlight

<s> private banks are less reliable than government on privacy . <eos>
