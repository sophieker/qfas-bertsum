<s> non-profit : is it importance that co-ops are non-profits ? <eos>

<s> while many social entrepreneurial may find in the goodness of their hearts the will to start a nonprofit co-op most people are not wanting to invest the initial and sustained effort in something that does not provide increasing returns and profit over time . this is simply human natural and it places a significant cap on the the potential for co-ops to scale widely and successfully . indeed this is why only two major health insurance co-ops exist in america - group health and health partners - instead of thousands of them across the nation . as long as co-ops continue to be non-profits they will not be able to spread widely and help solving the problem of # million uninsured americans . <eos>

@highlight

<s> non-profit cooperatives scale widely no profit incentive . <eos>
