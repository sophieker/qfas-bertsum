<s> people that have pets typically develop an affection and even love for their pets and often believe that their pets return that love and affection . they generally believe that animals have feelings express happiness and feel pain and suffering at times . most would never allow their own pets to be subjected to testing for most of the above reasons . why then would they believe it acceptable to subject other animals to such testing ; animals that have the same capacity for the above feelings ? <eos>
