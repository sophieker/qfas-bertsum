<s> does the fact that there were no stars in the background mean the # moon landing may have been faked ? <eos>

<s> all the lunar landings occurred on the daylight side of the moon . with the sun above them it would be impossible for them to see any stars in the sky . the same holds true in low-earth orbit from the space shuttle or the space station . pictures in low-earth orbit taken on the daylight side of earth never feature stars either . the idea that stars could possibly be seen in space while the sun is in the sky is the product of works of fiction . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the glare of the sun works exactly the same way on the moon as it does on the earth or <eos>
