<s> strategic ban : does a ban on arms retail consistent with the eu 's strategic objectives ? <eos>

<s> the us fears less the chinese purchase of eu weaponry and armor than that the regimes will get hold of advanced communications and control systems as well as high-technology guidance systems night-vision equipment etc . - all of which would making its existing military much more effective . even if the eu is reluctant to sell such material to china the possibility will giving the chinese leverage in negotiations with existing suppliers like israel and ukraine who will feel under more pressure to sell china their most modern technology . in time china 's ability to `` reverse engineer '' high-technology equipment will also boost their own military research and development programmes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lifting the arm bans will strengthen china militarily . <eos>
