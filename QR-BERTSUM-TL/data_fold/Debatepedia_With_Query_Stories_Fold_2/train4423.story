<s> media : does western media pay too little attention to poverty vs climate change ? <eos>

<s> while it may be true that the media does not give enough attention to poverty it is not necessarily the case that it is giving too much attention to climate change . instead it may be right on target as far as the threat climate change poses and the attention it is now receiving . <eos>

@highlight

<s> media is giving appropriate weight to climate change . <eos>
