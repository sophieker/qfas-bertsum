<s> socialised medicine : can a private options avoid becoming `` socialized medicine '' ? <eos>

<s> critics frequently argue that government-run health care involves the government `` rationing '' health care . yet private insurances companies `` ration '' to an even greater regard by denying claims and developing methods for maximizing profits and minimize outlays to those they are insuring . `` rationing '' in this sense is the core companies model of insurances companies . how can a government-run insurances option be any worse than this particularly when it does not have the for-profit motives so will offer as too health care to as many people as possible ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> private insurers ration as-much or more than private insurance . <eos>
