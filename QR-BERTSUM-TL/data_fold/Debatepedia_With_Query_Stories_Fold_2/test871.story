<s> history of sovereignty : had spain controlled the malvinas more than britain ? <eos>

<s> nations often can claim that they or their ancestors once controlled a territory . but if all of these claims were recognized the world 's boundaries would be in turmoil as many separate peoples would have a legitimate claim to some territory . to get around this problem we must give precedent to more modern and contemporary historical claims . since britain has controlled the falklands for nearly two-hundred years its claim takes precedence . moreover the arguement is backed by the unanimous support of the islanders themselves claiming to be british citizens . <eos>

@highlight

<s> argentina 's historical claim to the falklands is too outdated . <eos>
