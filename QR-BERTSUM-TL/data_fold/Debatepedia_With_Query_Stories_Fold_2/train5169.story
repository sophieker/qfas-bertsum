<s> time : would the time consume by instant replay be limited ? <eos>

<s> steve hirsch . `` why instant replays is unnecessary . '' cnn post . june # # : `` the most use argument against instant replays is that it would increase the length of games which is clearly true . the more managers protest the more plays get reviewed and the more games get prolonged . i love baseball more than anyone i know but but i do n't want baseball games lasting longer than they already do . '' <eos>
