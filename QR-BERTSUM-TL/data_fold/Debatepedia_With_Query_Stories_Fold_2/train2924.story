<s> abortion-like ? is emergency contraception think a form of abortion ? if so is abortion wrong ? <eos>

<s> precisely how such contraceptives work depends on the stage of the menstrual cycle at which they are taken but they can delay ovulation inhibiting the tubal transport of egg and sperm interfering with fertilisation or alter the lining of the uterus to prevent the implantation of a fertilised egg . at the stage when the contraceptive is effectiveness there is no viable pregnancy so there can be no abortion . if a woman is already pregnancy a morning-after pill will not induce an abortion . in any case if abortion is legal then arguing that emergency contraceptives is a form of abortion is not a compelling argument against it .

@highlight

<s> emergency contraceptives is not equivalent to abortion : <eos>
