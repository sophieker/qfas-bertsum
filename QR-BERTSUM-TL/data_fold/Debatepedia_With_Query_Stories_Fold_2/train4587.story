<s> humane ? - is whaling a humane practice ? <eos>

<s> before the whale is harpooned it is normally exhausted by a long and stressful chase . as a moving target it is difficult for a marksman to achieve a direct hit on a whale with an explosive-tipped harpoon so many are wounded and survive for many minute before finally being killed by rifle shots or by additional harpoons . but when a direct hit is scored the explosives often fail to detonate . overall japan whaling ships report that only # % of whales are killed instantly by the first shot .

@highlight

<s> whalers is intrinsically cruel . <eos>
