<s> judicial process : do gitmo courts provide adequate judicial process ? <eos>

<s> it is fair to hold someone without charge or trial under the term of a military order initiated in september # as enemy combatants . this is similar to holding prisoners of war until hostilities cease in which it is not lawfully necessary to provide the prisoners with redress to judicial process . it is merely necessary to waiting until hostilities cease . under the same logic `` enemy combatants '' can be held without judicial redress until hostilities in the war on terror or the war against al qaeda cease . <eos>
