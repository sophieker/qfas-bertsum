<s> is space a better place for solar panels than the earth 's surface ? <eos>

<s> transmission of the generated power from space to earth poses a significant technological challenge . while microwave wireless energy transfer and/or laser beaming of the generated power seems theoretically possible practical demostrations have been carried out only on a scale/distance much smaller than needed for the construction of a decently sized space-based solar power plant . <eos>
