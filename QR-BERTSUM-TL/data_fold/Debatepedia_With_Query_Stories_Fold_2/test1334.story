<s> military value : do cluster bombs have little or significant military value ? <eos>

<s> that the united states is claiming that a cluster bomb ban treaty will undermine its ability to work with other nations in peace keepign and other operations is a sad and unfortunate threat and strong-arming tactic . the purpose is not to explain reality but to threaten allies that dare to sign any ban with the prospect of losing the support of the united states in important strategic or humanitarian missions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us strong-arms nations by saying cluster bomb ban undermines alliances <eos>
