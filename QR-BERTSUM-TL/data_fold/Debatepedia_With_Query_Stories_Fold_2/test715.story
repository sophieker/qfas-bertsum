<s> abuse : is the veto power subject to individual interests ? <eos>

<s> the problem with general assembly `` uniting for peace '' resolutions is that they do n't circumvent the reality that the security council is still responsible for the implementation of measures . therefore if a `` uniting for peace '' measure was designed to take any action it would almost certainly fail to be implemented by the security council due to blockage by the vetoing member . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` uniting for peace '' resolutions to bypass un vetoes are only symbolic <eos>
