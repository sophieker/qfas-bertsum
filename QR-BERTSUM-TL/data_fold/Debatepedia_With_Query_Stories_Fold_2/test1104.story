<s> democracy : is the superdelegate systems sufficiently representative and democratic ? <eos>

<s> this argument generally sits on the notion that voters should decide the direction of elections and that superdelegates are primarily responsible for flocking to the support of the candidate that the voters select . the purpose of this is to providing the nominee a good delegate margin to strengthen their legitimacy as the nominee and to unify the party around them . but in # delegates have been committing before the voting is done . <eos>

@highlight

<s> superdelegate are wrongly committing before vote is doing <eos>
