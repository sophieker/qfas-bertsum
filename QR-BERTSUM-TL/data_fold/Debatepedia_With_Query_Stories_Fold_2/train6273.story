<s> quality of life : does `` do n't ask do n't tell '' improve or harm gay troops quality of life ? <eos>

<s> `` do n't ask do n't tell '' made us military policy more flexible and accommodating to gays in the military . the key element was that shifted policy from officer overtly seeking persecuting courts mustering and discharging ( often dishonorably ) toward a policy that restricted the ability of officer and commanders to inquire on the orientation of a soldiers and pursue subsequent action . it also set a higher burden of proof in demonstrating that a person was a homosexual . this general shift toward accommodation was an improvement and should be recognized as such . <eos>
