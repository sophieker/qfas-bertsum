<s> paul m. fleiss md . `` the case against circumcision '' . mothering . winter # - `` millions of years of evolution have fashioned the human body into a model of refinement elegance and efficiency with every part having a function and purpose . evolution has determined that mammals ' genitals should be sheathed in a protective responsive multipurpose foreskin . every normal human being is born with a foreskin . in females it protects the glans of the clitoris ; in males it protects the glans of the penis . thus the foreskin is an essential part of human sexual anatomy . '' <eos>
