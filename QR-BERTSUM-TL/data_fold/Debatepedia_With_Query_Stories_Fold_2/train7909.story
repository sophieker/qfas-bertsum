<s> international relations : is sending beings to space great for international relations ? <eos>

<s> sending humans into space or to other planets so that they can erect the flags of a particular nation is a distinctly nationalistic act and one that is likely to create aggressive 'races ' in the future just as it has before . china s manned programme is openly intended to challenge the we dominance of space for the communist regime s huge propaganda benefit . george w. bush s pledges to boost spending on nasa and to restart the manned mission to mars programme was a directly response . this is damaging not only because of the potential for space race conflicts to escalate into greater international hostility but also because of the ways such race could result in the militarization of space <eos>

@highlight

<s> flag-staking is occurring in spaces and spread nationalist sentiments . <eos>
