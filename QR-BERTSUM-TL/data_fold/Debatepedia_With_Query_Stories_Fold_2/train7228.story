<s> rights : is it wrong to believe that animals have rights ? <eos>

<s> this is frequent argument of animal rights activists ; that animals deserve rights because they have at least as much capacity to reason as do some retarded humans who retain rights . the problem with this argument is that it fails to see rights as a thing that must be shared among a group of creatures not something that is extended on an individual basis . therefore the question is not whether some humans are incapable of having rights but rather whether human kind as a species is capable of having rights . they are . non-human animals conversely as a class of organisms are not capable of holding rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> that the retarded have rights does not justify animal rights <eos>
