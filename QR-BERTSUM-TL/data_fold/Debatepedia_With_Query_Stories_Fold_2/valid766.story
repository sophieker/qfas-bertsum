<s> quality : does free universal health health provide superior care ? <eos>

<s> the single most destructive issue concerning health care in america is the lacking of preventative care . patients wait until their disease progressing to a dangerous level before they seek care because otherwise they can not afford medical cost . universal health care offers them access thus increasing the patient 's incentives to seek care when the health threat is minimal and in the short running reducing the burden to the state . <eos>
