<s> militia : is a handgun inconsequential to a militia ? is the militia irrelevant today ? <eos>

<s> the differences in the technology the military now employs versus the personal gun individual civilian can have access to is exponentially greater than in the framer 's time . this means that in today 's reality the second amendment can not apply to civilian with the purpose of preparing them to be part of the militia at any days or time.the huge technological advances and military training make it impossible for everyday citizen to be part of a defense force like the `` militia '' . <eos>
