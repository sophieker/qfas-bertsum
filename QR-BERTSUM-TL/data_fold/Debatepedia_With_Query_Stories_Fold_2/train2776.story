<s> civil war ? could an early withdrawal avoid causing a civil war ? <eos>

<s> coalition forces are regarded `` occupiers '' in iraq . as a result when the coalition works predominantly with shiites on security and in the iraqi governments shiites are subsequently viewed by sunnis as `` collaborators '' . this makes it more difficult for sunnis to working with shiites out of fear of being branded as working with the `` collaborators '' ; in effect being labeled `` collaborators '' themselves . a us withdrawal could eliminate these fears of cooperation and help avoiding law war . <eos>

<s> an early withdrawal would ends sunni fears of work with sunni `` collaborators '' <eos>
