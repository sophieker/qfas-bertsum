<s> socialised medicine : is it mistake to call government-run systems socialised medicine ? <eos>

<s> doctors resources are rationed in socialized systems so that some people are either denied care or have to wait for it . if a person is `` rationed out '' of the public healthcare care service ( perhaps because the treatments is not considered effective or cost effective enough to warrant intervention ) they will be able seek alternative treatments in the private sector . if they can not pay private care they may have to go without . <eos>

@highlight

<s> universally health care leads to rationing . <eos>
