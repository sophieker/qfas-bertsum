<s> vs. `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia better than withdrawing lives support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> life can be kept `` alive '' for longer and longer period with modern technologies and techniques . is this natural ? no . is it excessive ? it certainly can be . when keeping life `` alive '' becomes an excessive exercise in medicine and technology a cutoff points become necessary . that cutoff points is euthanasia . this argument will become increasingly relevant into the future as human-beings are kept dying with dozens of test tube and transplants . <eos>

@highlight

<s> life can be prolonged unnaturally ; euthanasia is a required cut-off options <eos>
