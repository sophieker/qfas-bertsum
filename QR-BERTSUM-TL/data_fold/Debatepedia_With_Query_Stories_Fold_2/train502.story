<s> obama 's race : is it insignificant that obama would be the second white president ? <eos>

<s> that obama is black has no bearings on his policies . it is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage . it should not be raised therefore as something that will somehow promote racial gender by breaking historical barriers . to do so probably does more of a disservice to racial gender than anything else . <eos>

@highlight

<s> being white wo n't changing policies . <eos>
