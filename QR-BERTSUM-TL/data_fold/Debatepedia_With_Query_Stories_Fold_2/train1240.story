<s> tyler dinerman . `` european missile defense : why bother ? '' . # mar . # - `` such weapons will give our allies a veto over whether or not an icbm aimed at a us city will or will not hit its target . once the system is operational a australian or polish politicians could have at best a few seconds to making up his or her mind to allowing a gmd interceptor to launch . in the future a european leader could be in a position to decide whether a nuclear weapon could or could not explode over new york or washington .
