<s> if measures are passed in the un that even a single of the great powers objects to the chances that the measure will be implemented are very slim as a great power is liable to take unilateral action to blocks implementation . the un will be powerless to carry through its measure and its credibility will be damaged . therefore the vetoed is something of a safety valves that ensures that no measures are passed that will fail in the face of geopolitical realities . <eos>
