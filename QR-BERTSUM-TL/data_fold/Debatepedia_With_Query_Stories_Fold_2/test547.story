<s> waste : do earmarks lead to excessive spending and waste ? <eos>

<s> david minge former member of the u.s. house of representatives . `` the case against academic earmarking '' - `` if institutions rely on earmarking they face the vagaries of the political process in a much more capricious way . they risk the loss of their political patron . members of congress and the senate move on . those institutions that depend on a 'sugar daddy ' may face a period of drought when their patron leaves . recently senator john kerry ( d-ne ) said that the university of nebraska lost $ 30 million per year when he retired . indeed his decision was a sad moment for faculty and staff at that institution . '' <eos>
