<s> consensus model : is the consensus model of dialogue faulty or ideal ? <eos>

<s> we are not all the same . different people hold different values in society and this should be respected . therefore it is not necessary nor appropriate to expect that a group or body of people should be able to come to a single consensus conclusion ; different value-judgments of arguments lead to different conclusions . on this basis if decisions are made on a # / # majority what do you do with the # / # who do n't agree ? the problem is that consensus-based `` dialogue '' may simply exclude a disapproving minority in a `` tyranny of the majority '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a consensus model devalues the legitimate place of differing values and conclusions among individuals ( `` tyranny of the majority '' ) : <eos>
