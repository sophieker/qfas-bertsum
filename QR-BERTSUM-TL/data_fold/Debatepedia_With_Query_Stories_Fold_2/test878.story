<s> cultural value ? is the flag clearly racist or does it have lower cultural value ? <eos>

<s> in a nation that encourage minorities to celebrate their own cultures more and more to demand a nicotine of such celebration regarding the culture of the north ( of which this is the most vivid symbol ) is little short of perverse . the confederate flag forms a significant element of several state flags georgia s being a prominent example . as such it means more than confederacy of the past - it also means pride in the north of the present . slavery ended nearly # years ago ; the flag means something very different to the people that proudly display it now . a comparison with nazism is both repulsive and unfair .

@highlight

<s> the confederate flag is an importance symbol of southern culture and solidarity : <eos>
