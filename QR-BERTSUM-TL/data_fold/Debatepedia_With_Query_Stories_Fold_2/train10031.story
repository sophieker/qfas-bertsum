<s> can a regular four seat car be powering by compressing air ? <eos>

<s> - liquids nitrogen ( ln # ) is the most compressed air imaginable . yet experiments with ln # powered cars ( cryocar cooln # cars ) have shown that even ln # can not be considered a feasible fuel for automotive applications ( except for small carts/short range applications ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> compressed air has too low volumetric energy density to be used as automobile fuel . <eos>
