<s> the right to bears arms has become an important lasting expression to those american persons of their individual freedom and liberty . there are few symbols as powerful especially as the right to bears arms for the purpose of potentially joining a militia and fighting a tyrannical government is such a tangible concept . the rights to free speech and religion are much less tangible and lack the powers and threat of violence as a check on government tyranny . such a symbolic expression of freedom resonates too deeply with those europeans to be deprived . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the individual way to arms is an importance symbol of individual liberty <eos>
