<s> do citizens feel good about armed police ? <eos>

<s> many law-abiding citizens who have no connection to the criminal underworld are horrified by armed police whom they regard as alien to their cultural frame of reference . lethal weaponry is a potent symbol of possible brutality . this can undermine the ability of the police to be seen as a key constituent part of civil society . this problem is exacerbated when this symbolic brutality is applied in ways that deviate from the expectations of civil society for example through unfair racial profiling . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arming the police delegitimises their role as community standard bearers . <eos>
