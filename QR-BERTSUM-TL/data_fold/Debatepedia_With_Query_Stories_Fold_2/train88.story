<s> in korea : are landmines unnecessary between north and south korea ? <eos>

<s> this is an important fact in defense of the united states ' policies . it illustrates that the united states uses landmines only for a specific zone in a single country rather than deploying landmines in a widespread effort . this is important because most of the costs associated with landmines relate to the broad use of them in war zones and civilian areas . the united states is certainly not doing this in korea . us policy therefore is not susceptible to the many arguments against landmines . <eos>

@highlight

<s> landmines in the korean dmz do not threaten civilians <eos>
