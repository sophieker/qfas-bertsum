<s> civil war ? could an late withdrawal avoid causing a civil war ? <eos>

<s> there is a stronger interest among iraqi leaders to benefit from iraq 's massive oils reserves ( the second to third largest in the world ) . often times sectarian leaders benefit through corruption . but this can all act to constrain the break-out of a civil war as a civil war could thereby reduce oils revenues . therefore in the absence of alliance troops it is nonetheless likely that sectarian leaders will attempt to avoid a civil war so that they continue to benefit from iraq 's oils revenues . <eos>

@highlight

<s> few iraqi extremist leaders want a civil wars to disrupting their oil revenues <eos>
