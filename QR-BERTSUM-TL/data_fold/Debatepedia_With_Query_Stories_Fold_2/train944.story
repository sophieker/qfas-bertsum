<s> is scientific shape by social forces ? or is our society shape by science progress ? <eos>

<s> society also determined the changes that were made to the previous generation media players that the manufactures developed . take for instance today 's media players . at the beginning cassettes were being used to store data . however that method was large and unwieldy so the manufactures develop compact disc which were larger and could hold more data . later compact disc were again too large and did not hold enough data that forced today 's manufactures to creating mp # players which are small and holds large amount of data . today 's society determined the course of events that many manufactures took to improving their products so today 's consumers will purchase their products . <eos>

<s> demanding for technologies determines the direction of science progress . <eos>
