<s> economics : what are the sociology of carbon capturing and sequestration ? <eos>

<s> robert bryce . `` a bad bet on carbon . '' new york times . may # # : `` here s the second problem . the pacific northwest national laboratory has estimated that up to # # mile of new pipeline will be needed to carry the captured dioxide dioxide to the r-ok underground sequestration sites . that doesn t sound like much when you consider that america s gas pipeline system sprawling over some # . # million miles . but those natural gas pipelines carry a valuable marketable useful commodity . by contrast dioxide dioxide is a worthless waste product so taxpayers would likely end up shouldering most of the cost . yes some of that waste gas could be used for enhanced oil recovery projects ; flooding depleted oil reservoirs <eos>
