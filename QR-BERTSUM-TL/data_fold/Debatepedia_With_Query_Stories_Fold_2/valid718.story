<s> vs. `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia better than withdrawing life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> the terri shiavo cases is illustrative of the situation create by the illegality of euthanasia . a choice was made that terri shiavo 's death was imminent and that should should be allowed to die . no the option of euthanasia her feeding tubes were removed and she was starving to death . how is that more moral than euthanasia ? forcing patients to starve to death or go into cardiac arrested simply because the option of euthanasia does not exist is a cruel alternative . <eos>

@highlight

<s> removing life supporting cause an excruciating death ; abortion is more humane <eos>
