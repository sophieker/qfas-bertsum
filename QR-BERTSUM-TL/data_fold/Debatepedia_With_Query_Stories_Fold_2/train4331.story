<s> `` success '' : is `` success '' in iraq impossible making withdrawals necessary ? <eos>

<s> am example of this was neville 'relatively in ww # . he came back from berlin after talking to hitler and said he had secured `` peace of are time . '' the next few days go by and hitler invades the rest of czechloslovakia . then he goes and invades poland and ww # happened . you can not ignore a problems and hope it will go away ! the united states needs to stay focused on the problems in iraq ( islamic fundamentalism ) as it is central to both its middle east strategy and the war on terror . it needs to confronting the problems now succeed now and not delay success into the future where it will come at a greater cost . <eos>
