<s> ending pain : is euthanasia justified to end the pain of a chronically sick patient ? <eos>

<s> supporters of abortion sometimes argue that the ill are no longer the person they were and therefore that their lives have no more meaning and that abortion can alleviate any suffering that this causes . but humans identity should be define as connected with the continued existence of the body but if mental capacities are completely diminished . but if a personality is gone the continued dignity of the bodily identity should be respected . <eos>

@highlight

<s> euthanasia is falsely based on the idea that the sick can losing their identities <eos>
