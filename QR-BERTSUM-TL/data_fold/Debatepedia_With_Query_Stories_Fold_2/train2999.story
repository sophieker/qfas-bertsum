<s> abuse : would legalization avoid opening a slippery slopes to abuse and murder ? <eos>

<s> there is very little historical evidence of doctors actually coercing patient into accept euthanasia against their will . part of the reason is that it is a major leap from patient having to request euthanasia to doctors forcing it upon them . it reality it is not a very implausible leap particularly with the number of checks that would be in place against such abuses upon legalization . <eos>

@highlight

<s> history does not suggest doctors coerce patient into euthanasia <eos>
