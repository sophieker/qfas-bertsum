<s> not torture ? is it wrong to calling water-boarding torture ? <eos>

<s> while many supporters of water-boarding defend the practice as `` simulated '' drowning water-boarding probably involves waters entering the lung until suffocation or nearby suffocation . this is drowning not `` simulated '' drowning . the only difference is that the suspect is not killing or is revived from death . <eos>
