<s> empirically buyology evolutionary <eos>

<s> hello or oiijhgfgkjhdgkjlbagkjhadffg ? an arguments can be made for either . more importantly however is the fact that this claim is simply nonsense . a number of mechanisms for increasing information exist . the most important is gene duplication where a single gene is duplicate and then one instance is subject to mutation . this process has repeatedly seen and is extensively documented such as brown et al 's `` multiple duplications of bacterial hexose transport genes in response to selection in a glucose-limited environment '' [ # ] lenski 's o bacterial experiments [ # ] and knox et al 's molecular evolutionary of bacterial beta-lactam resistance [ # ] among many others . <eos>

<s> hey <eos>
