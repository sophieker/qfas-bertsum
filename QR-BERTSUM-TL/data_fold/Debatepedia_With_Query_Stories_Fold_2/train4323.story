<s> simplicity : are progressive tax systems straightforward enough ? <eos>

<s> daniel nemiroff . `` simplification without a flat tax '' . the gazette ( montreal ) . # may # - `` both william watson and neils veldhuis make compelling cases for simplification of the tax code . they are largely incorrect and most canadians would agree that loopholes ought to be closed extravagant deduction disallowed and all forms of incomes - salary capital gains or stock-option bonuses - be treated the same [ ... ] both men then commit the fallacy of equating tax code simplification with a flat tax. [ ... ] there is no reason we ca n't implement most of veldhuis 's shortcuts and keep a progressive tax system . we 'll still have to fill out a return but as long as we keep the math simple - e.g . # per cent on the first $ # <eos>
