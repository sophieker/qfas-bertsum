<s> china bloc : does china have the capacity to form a threatening political bloc among nations to counter other global powers ? <eos>

<s> as the largest recipient of global aid and a very reluctant donor china is certainly not buying herself any allies . china is not even a cultural leader for ethnic chinese populations exemplified in its failures to demand un or asean intervention in malaysia in # - # during the persecution of the ethnic chinese sector of society . for two thousand years china abhorred the notion of global interdependence and believed that she was big enough merely to learn from the outside world whilst controlling her own destiny . although economic globalization has modified this approach there is no evidence that it has evolved into an aggressive or expansionist philosophy .

@highlight

<s> for such a large country the influences that chinese exerts over other nations is astonishingly small . <eos>
