<s> for baseball : does basketball lend itself well to instant replay ? <eos>

<s> steve hirsch . `` why instant replay is unnecessary . '' huffington post . june # # : `` even if major league baseball decided to implement the use of instant replay this is hardly the game that should be the deciding factor [ the detroit pitchers jorge gallaraga 's ideal game in june of # ] . in the ends the only thing that was affected by jim joyce 's botched call was a personal achievement . the final score was the same and the winning and losing pitchers remained unchanged . [ ... ] if a fan or a player is more concerned with a personal achievement than how their teams finishes in the standings then that person needs to reorganize its priorities during a game . '' <eos>
