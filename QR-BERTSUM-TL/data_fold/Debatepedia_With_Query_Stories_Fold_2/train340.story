<s> retention : does `` do n't ask do n't tell '' harm or improve retention ? '' <eos>

<s> letter from the american center for military readiness . march 3 2009 - `` do n't ask do n't tell was formulated in response to president clinton 's direction to the secretary of defense to find a way to enable homosexuals who wish to serve to do so . the policy removed the question : 'are you homosexual ? ' from the uniformed services enlistment application form ( 'do n't ask ' ) ; asserted that open admission of homosexuality or homosexual conduct were a basis for discharge ( 'do n't tell ' ) ; and charged military leaders not to pursue suspected homosexuals without clear evidence of conduct or open admissions . '' <eos>

<s> `` do n't ask do n't tell '' does not actively pursue gays <eos>
