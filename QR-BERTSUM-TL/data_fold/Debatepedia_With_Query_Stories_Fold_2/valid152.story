<s> sexual morality : does condom-use violate principles of sexual morality ? <eos>

<s> there is no reason that sexual morality can not be taught along with the distribution of condoms . the possession of condoms does not in itself motivate sexual immorality and irresponsibility ; many other cultural factors are involved . teaching proper sexual morals can easily accompany condom distribution and use . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sexual morality can/should go hand-in-hand with condom-use <eos>
