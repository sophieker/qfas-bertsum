<s> intervention : can governments intervention help ? or is it generally a bad idea ? <eos>

<s> robert j. shiller . `` everybody calm down . a government hand in the economy is as old as the republic . '' washington post . # sept. # -- `` our economy is not a shining example of pure unfettered market forces . it never has been ... from the outset washington envisioned some government involvement in the commercial system even as he recognized that commerce should belong to the people ... so is the government 's bailout a major departure ? hardly . today 's federal involvement offers bailouts as a purely temporary measure to prevent a district-wide financial calamity . this is completely in keeping with our basic principles -- as long as the bailout promotes rather than impedes financial democracy .
