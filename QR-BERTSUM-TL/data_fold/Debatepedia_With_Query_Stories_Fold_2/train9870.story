<s> enforcement : is a bans on landmines enforceable over time ? <eos>

<s> it only stops nations that obeying the law from using landmines . most nations contemplating invading will ignore it deploying them aggressively to defend captured territory . on the other hand many nations that would use landmines defensively for themselves or for multinational defence of another vulnerable country or people will observe the ban and thus weaken themselves and expose those they guard . the landmine should in fact be a primary tool of the united nations efforts to protect those in its care . nations that want to use landmines will do so regardless of the position taking by the usa ( or any other nation ) - as demonstrated by the current prolific use of mines despite the masses of signatories to the ottawa <eos>

@highlight

<s> the bans has an directional effect . <eos>
