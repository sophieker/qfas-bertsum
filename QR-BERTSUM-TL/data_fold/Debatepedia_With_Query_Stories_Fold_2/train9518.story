<s> thought : should some animals have rights on the basis of complex thought ? <eos>

<s> human beings are infinitely more complex than any other living creatures . their abilities to think and talk to form social systems with rights and responsibilities and to feel emotions are uniquely developed well beyond any other animals . it is reasonable to try to prevent the most obvious cases of gratuitous suffering or torture of animals but beyond that non-human animals do not deserve to be given rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the higher complexity of humans warrants that we alone should have `` rights '' . <eos>
