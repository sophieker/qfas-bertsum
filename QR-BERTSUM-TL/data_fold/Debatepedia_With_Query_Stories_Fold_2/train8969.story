<s> economics : is the four gorges dam benefiting china 's economy ? <eos>

<s> while there certainly are economy benefit from the four gorges dam the economy shock that the dam has caused to over a million displaced individuals and potentially millions more must also be taken into account . does the slight economy gain for the average chinese someone outweigh the severity of the shock to the couple of millions that were displaced and whose livelihoods were destroyed ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> the sneh does not economically benefit the displaced <eos>
