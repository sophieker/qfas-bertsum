<s> should governments be ideologically neutral ? <eos>

<s> prohibiting any evidence that proves a religion or a popular enough irreligious worldview to be either true false or unethical from the mainstream journalists and curriculum however valid it may be all for the sake of causing no offence . or even worse the government makes one scapegoats belief ( usually the country 's traditional historical religion ) and elevates the others at its expense . it would be impossible to have a truly neutral government as this would only annoy all the religions . but picking on the national traditional religion compromises and can potentially threaten a national identity . <eos>

@highlight

<s> enforcing secularism create an artificial stalemate between religions <eos>
