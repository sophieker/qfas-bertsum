<s> marine ecosystems : is tidal energy consistent with preserving marine ecosystems ? <eos>

<s> ocean energy council : tidal energy - `` the few studies that have been undertaken to date to identify the environmental impacts of a tidal power scheme have determined that each specific site is different and the impacts depend greatly upon local geography . '' it is important therefore to judge the potential for tidal energy on a case by case basis . <eos>

@highlight

<s> environmental-soundness of tidal energy varies ; judgement required <eos>
