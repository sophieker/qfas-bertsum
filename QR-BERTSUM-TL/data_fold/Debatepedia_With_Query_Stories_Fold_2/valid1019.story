<s> attention : does criminalization help muffle holocaust deniers ? <eos>

<s> in 2000 historian deborah lipstadt confronted holocaust denier and pseudo-historian david irving in one of the most famous trials in recent british history . irving had sued dr. lipstadt for libel after she correctly labeled him as a holocaust denier . irving was later imprisoned for his views yet lipstadt called for his release arguing `` generally i do n't think holocaust denial should be a crime . [ ... ] i do n't find these laws efficacious . i think they turn holocaust denial into forbidden fruit and make it more attractive to people who want to toy with the system or challenge the system . '' [ 8 ] <eos>
