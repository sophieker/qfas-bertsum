<s> accomplishments : did barack obama deserve the peace prize based on his accomplishments ? <eos>

<s> according to nobel 's will the peace prize should be awarded to the person who : `` during the preceding year [ ... ] shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses . '' and yet during this year barack obama was only campaigning was not the president of the united states and had not yet implemented any concrete steps toward peace . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama only campaigned in 2008 year for which he received peace prize . <eos>
