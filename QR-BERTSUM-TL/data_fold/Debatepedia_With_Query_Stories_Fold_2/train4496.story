<s> should people have to pay to park their car ? <eos>

<s> the council should not profit from people parking their cars . this is unfair . it is an inevitable thing that people need to put their car somewhere will they shop or go to work and they do n't want people profiting from it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> everyone needs to put their car somewhere why make them pay ? <eos>
