<s> darting/euthanasia : is darted and euthanizing kangaroo humane ? <eos>

<s> kangaroo culling by darts for anesthetic and then with poison to euthanize kangaroos can actually lead to severe distress pain and suffering among individual kangaroos and group of kangaroos . first caused to the lower accuracy of darts a sharp shooter must be much closer with darts than with bullets which often disturbs the kangaroo herd . second darts do not kill kangaroos immediately nor do they immediately sedate them creating the potential for the thumping around of a kangaroo which results in their injury suffering and the general distress of neighbouring kangaroos . third a human has to promptly approach the sedated kangaroo and perform the euthanasia which sufferings and disturbs the kangaroo herd often resulting in their thumping around in distress . <eos>
