<s> uphold christianity : is creationist important to christianity ? <eos>

<s> on this question the bible just is wrong and if you insist on holding a literalistic approaches to scripture then the implications you claims do indeed follow . however there is no theological want to do this . the roman catholic and the anglican churches for example have accepted the truths of evolution and they still hold what is a recognisably and distinctively christian faith . if the authors of the bible meant their creation stories to be taken literally then their claiming are open to scientific test . it is widely held that they wrote stories design to accounts for the world as they knew it and by todays standards these could not be held up as scientific accounts . <eos>
