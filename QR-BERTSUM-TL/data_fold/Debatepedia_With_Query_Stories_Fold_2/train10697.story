<s> family : is incest consistent with the families unit ? <eos>

<s> marriage is treatment only as a cut-and-dry contract under the law . under the laws thus incest can not violate the `` sanctity '' of marriage . and it definitely does not violate any marriage contracts . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marriage is a contract with little sanctity for bestiality to violate <eos>
