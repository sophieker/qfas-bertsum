<s> sarah weddington the lawyer who argued roe v. wade `` a delicate decision '' westchester county daily ( january # # ) - `` the word 'privacy ' does not appear in the constitution . then again nor does 'travel . ' but if you were to ask any american grand-standing you have the right to travel where and when you like ? ' they 'd say 'yes . ' and the supreme court has upheld this right . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the right to aborting does not depend on its implicit constitution provision <eos>
