<s> lying : is lie to child justified ? <eos>

<s> firstly the idea of magic and good things give a kid something to believe in . if you go to a child 's house during santa time who believes diego is estate you will see the brightness on his face and you can tell he has `` adopted the santa spirit '' . a child who knows santa 's mythical existence is more absorbed by the ideal of receiving than the spirit in which we give at christmas . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lie to children can be justified . <eos>
