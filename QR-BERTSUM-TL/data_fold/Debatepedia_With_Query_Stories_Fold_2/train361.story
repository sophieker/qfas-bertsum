<s> `` crazy solar shield not # % crazy '' . trees hugger . - `` global warming is not causing by greenhouse gases themselves but by the solar electricity that they trap on earth . if we ca n't reducing the amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere fast enough we are faced with a problem . but what if we could influence the other variable : the amount of solar electricity that gets to the earth ? '' <eos>
