<s> viability : would s. ossetia be a viable state ? <eos>

<s> south ossetia has a population of roughly 70 000. this would make it one of the smallest states in the world . this fact combined with its high level of poverty makes it a poor candidate for independence . <eos>

@highlight

<s> s. ossetia 's population is too small to warrant statehood . <eos>
