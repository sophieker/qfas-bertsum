<s> society : is an incest ban bad public policy ? <eos>

<s> the children of incestuous parents are much more likely to see incest as acceptable and to therefore engage in incest themselves . the problem with this is that second-generation incest is even more likely to involve medical and genetic problems . third-generation incest is even more risky and so on . therefore incest is an unsustainable social model . to this extent a ban on incest is good social public policy . and to the extent that incest is bad for society and its collective interests incest is immoral . <eos>

@highlight

<s> inbreeding is unsustainable for society so is bad law . <eos>
