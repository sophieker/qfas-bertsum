<s> broader strategy : is a continuation of the war in iraq contrary to us/coalition interests ? <eos>

<s> getting out too soon will simply reinforcing the views of those who thought the invasion mistake in the first place . on the other hand staying in iraq to secure peaceful democracy and human rights will set a positive example to other nations and show that the values for which the war was publicly fought were genuine ; to spreading democracy with conviction and determination . <eos>

@highlight

<s> succeeding in iraq will help justifying the war and those who supported it . <eos>
