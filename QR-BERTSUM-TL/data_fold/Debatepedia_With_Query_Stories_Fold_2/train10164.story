<s> arguments : <eos>

<s> if a couple is truly compatible enough to get married then they should be mature enough to live together regardless because of their love for each other . we live in a day and age that we know so much about other people and such that emotionally healthy couples should not need to live together to be together . for thousands of years couples could easily marry before living together because they were both committed to the relationship for one reason or another . living together before marriage promotes a lack of discipline in commitment . if they could easily go from living apart to living together without much ramifications or change in daily life it would n't matter in their minds after getting married <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is unneeded for an emotionally healthy couple . <eos>
