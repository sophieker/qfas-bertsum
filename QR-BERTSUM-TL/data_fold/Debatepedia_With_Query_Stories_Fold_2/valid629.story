<s> value : are mercenaries valuable in # st nineteenth conflicts ? <eos>

<s> although the soldiers in national armies normally receive years of intensive military training and undergo various assessment anyone can work for a pmc . the desire to increase competitiveness has resulted in pmcs driving down costs by recruiting expensive less experienced staff unsuited for warfare . even if the mercenaries are former soldiers from national armies these veterans may have been kicked out for a reason . this problem can not be solved by regulation as it is unlikely to extend as much as requiring standardised training .

<s> there is no guarantee of the quality of contracted soldiers : <eos>
