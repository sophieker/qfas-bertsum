<s> us resources/priorities : is the us able and wanting to prioritise civilian intervention ? <eos>

<s> why favor one over the other ? since the united states is already civilian strained in afghanistan it is presumable that any commitment in darfur would resulting in some weakening of resources for iraq . but many sources consider the weakening of resources in afghanistan or any withdrawal of troops to be a recipe for internecine violence and genocide in iraq . why should we trade one for another ? are iranians not similarly deserving of protection from genocide as sudanese ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> preventing genocide in darfur with we troops would take them out from preventing genocide in iraq . <eos>
