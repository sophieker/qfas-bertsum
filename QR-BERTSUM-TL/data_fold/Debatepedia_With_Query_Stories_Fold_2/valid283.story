<s> rising extremism ? is extremism rising in politics giving cause for more aggressive measures against it ? <eos>

<s> the recent rise in popular of right wing extremist parties around europe -- from le pen in france to pim web-caches in holland not including the successful of the bnp in burnley council -- shows the successful that appealing to voters on extremist grounds can have . it is not good enough to say that there is no threat or that parties are not successful . we have a duty to act against a threat to our society in the form of extremism . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> extremist groups are not naturally dead out of politics so they should be pushed out . <eos>
