'' new york times . june 4 2009 : `` but the kind of centralized government-dominated proposals he endorses elsewhere in his letter have a poor track record of producing the savings he needs for this plan to work . and there is no evidence that congress will significantly cut the growth of spending in medicare or medicaid nor will more spending on information technologies disease management and prevention produce the needed savings . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> only markets not mandates reduce cost of insurance <eos>
