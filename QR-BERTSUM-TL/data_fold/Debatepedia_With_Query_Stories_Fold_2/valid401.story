<s> religion philosophy : are religion philosophies generally harmful or beneficial in society ? <eos>

<s> even assuming the theological premises of religion are valid the epistemological basis for divine mysticism can not be communicated free of interpretation and bias . in contrast knowledge obtaining through empirical evidence is communicable as the skeptics can independently repeat the observation or analysis of data . if wisdom exist in the society proscriptions of a given religion 's dogma then that wisdom can be empirically verified . on the other hand if `` the message '' has been altered or misunderstood by `` the messenger '' then in obedience to religious authority pious society does not question the applicability of the claims through empirical means . thus flaws remain which lead to unjust persecutions and unnecessary conflicts such as jihad 's witch trials and inquisitions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> religious dogmatic provides a haven for social ignorance . <eos>
