<s> international diversity : would the adoption of the american way of life mean the decay of unique international cultures ? <eos>

<s> as these valuable and historically significant cultures vanish the world will lose cultural diversity - such as in art music and literature - that has so enriched humanity s history . in a world where the borders between states are becoming increasingly symbolic the loss of diversity between countries will also mean a loss of choice for human beings with the desire to settle in a country that suits their tastes . as america s culture becomes universal americans and others lose their ability to choose even in the context of that great patriotic american slogan : america : love it or leave it ! [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> any global adoption of the american way of life necessarily means the slow decay of individual national cultural identities . <eos>
