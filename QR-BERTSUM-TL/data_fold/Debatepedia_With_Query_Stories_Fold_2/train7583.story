<s> punishment : can tortures be justification as an adding form of punishment ? <eos>

<s> pity for terrible murderers and terrorist should not be fostered as it undermines that appropriate punishments of shame and guilt . yet torture affords such figures an element of pity from a public that generally opposes torture . the defendant is pitied and defended by the public instead of vilified . <eos>

@highlight

<s> torture actually creates sympathy for those who should otherwise be scorned and shamed . <eos>
