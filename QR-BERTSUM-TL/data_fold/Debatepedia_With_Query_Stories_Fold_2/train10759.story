<s> private opinion : do publics supporting capital punishments and should they be heeded ? <eos>

<s> ok. let 's conceded that public opinion does support the death penalty . however public opinion is n't always right nor justified . the public disapproved of the law wars of the we when it first occured but looking from retrospect it was another of the most important decisions in we history . public opinion supported segregation during the time of the kkk but racism is now illegal . just when had public opinion has always been right ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> public opinions is not imply way <eos>
