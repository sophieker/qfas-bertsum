<s> is warming changing a problem ? <eos>

<s> a team of mit scientists recorded a almost simultaneous world-wide increase in methane levels -the first increase in ten years . what baffles the team is that this data contradicts theories stating humans are the secondary source of increase in greenhouse gas . it takes about one full year for gases generated in the extremely industrial northern hemisphere to cycle through and reach the southern hemisphere . last all worldwide levels rose thereby throughout the same year however it is probable that this may be part of a natural cycle - and not the direct result of man 's contributions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the planet goes but warming cycles over time this is just another era . <eos>
