<s> screening : is broad screening ( scanners and pat-downs ) less effective ? <eos>

<s> bruce schneier . `` profiling makes us less safe . '' new york times room for debate . january 4th 2010 : `` as counterintuitive as it may seem we re all more secure when we randomly select people for secondary screening even if it means occasionally screening wheelchair-bound grandmothers and innocent looking children . '' <eos>
