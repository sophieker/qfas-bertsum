<s> economics : what are the economic pros and cons of this motion ? <eos>

<s> adaptation to climate change is in many ways a burden . but it also holds many opportunities . developed nations should see aid for adaptation as a way to invest in new opportunities that may arise in developing economies as a result of climate change . such opportunities could include the potential to grow new lucrative crops in new climates where rain may begin falling more or even less frequently ( which has advantages in certain climates and fer certain crops ) . this can create jobs in developing countries which is already an objective of developing countries . but it requires aid and investments of know-how that only developed countries can commit . <eos>

<s> adaptation aid can build on economic opportunities . <eos>
