<s> `` right to die '' ? does every citizen have a `` right to die '' at a time of choice ? <eos>

<s> if someone is threatening to kill themselves it is your moral duty to try to stop them . you would not for example simply ignore a man standing on a ledge and threatening to jump simply because it is his or her choice ; and you would definitely not assist in his suicide by pushing him . in the same way you should try to help a person with a terminal illness not help them to die . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is a moral duty to attempt to prevent suicide in general ; euthanasia too . <eos>
