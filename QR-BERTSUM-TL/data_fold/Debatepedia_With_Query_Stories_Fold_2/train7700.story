<s> resources : are annex i states more obligated due to greater resources ? <eos>

<s> brazil russia india china ( bric nations ) are all part of the g20 as mentioned in the above section . this means they are among the twenty wealthiest nations in the world despite the fact that they are often called `` developing nations '' . as a result it is wrong to assume that they do not have enough money to spare in the fight on climate change and in adapting to its effects . they have plenty of resources through a broad tax base to make major state investments in adapting to the effects of climate change and without the aid of developed countries . <eos>

@highlight

<s> brics are wealthy enough to adapt on own . <eos>
