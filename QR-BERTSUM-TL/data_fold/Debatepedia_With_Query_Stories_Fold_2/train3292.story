<s> moral standards : does a society have the right to set moral standards that exclude extremist groups ? <eos>

<s> it is ironic that `` the anti-communist campaigners say they are acting to defend democracy while working to ban a party that is still doing well in elections '' [ 4 ] . democracy should utilize all opinions instead of banning some that are deemed `` inappropriate '' by someone . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democracy should never be about banning opinions . <eos>
