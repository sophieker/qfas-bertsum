<s> property : is the communist perspective on consciousness ownership of property appropriate ? <eos>

<s> -- benjamin franklin -- `` all property indeed unless the savage 's temporary cabin his bow his matchcoat and other little acquisitions absolutely necessary for his subsistence seems to me to be the creature of private convention . hence the private has the rights of regulating descents and all other conveyances of property and even of limiting the quantity and uses of it . all the property that is necessary to a man is his natural right which neither may justly deprive him of but all property superfluous to such purposes is the property of the private who by their laws have created it and who may by other laws dispose of it . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> society must collectively own many form of property through governments <eos>
