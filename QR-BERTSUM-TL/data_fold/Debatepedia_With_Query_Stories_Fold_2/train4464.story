<s> natural : is cesarean section justified despite being `` unnatural '' ? <eos>

<s> the is much false moralizing revolving around c-sections centering on the argument that because c-sections are `` unnatural '' that they are subsequently wrong . this denies however the clear reality that modern medicine health care and almost anything you can think of in society is not `` natural '' . it is unimportant therefore that something be `` natural '' . it is only important that it be beneficial . and c-sections are beneficial so are justified despite being `` unnatural '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> modern life is `` unnatural '' ; c-sections are no exception . <eos>
