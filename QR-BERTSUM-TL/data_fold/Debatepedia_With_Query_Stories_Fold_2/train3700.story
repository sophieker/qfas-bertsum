<s> emissions : is naturally gas clean when burned for energy ? <eos>

<s> while natural fuel may be `` cleaner '' than burning other fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline it is still a `` dirty '' energy resource releasing substantial amounts of co # into the atmosphere . for an equivalent amount of heat energy burning natural fuel produces # % as too carbon dioxide as burning petroleum and # % as too as burning coal . [ # ] natural fuel is therefore only considerably cleaner than other fossil fuels . burning it still contributes considerably to global warming . it should not therefore be held out as a solution . <eos>
