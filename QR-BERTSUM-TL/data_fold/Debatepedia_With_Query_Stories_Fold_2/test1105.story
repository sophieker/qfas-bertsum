<s> diversity : will cloning lower genetic diversity in human populations ? <eos>

<s> the expense and time necessary for successful human cloning should mean that it will only be used to the benefit of the small minority of people who require the technology . the pleasure of procreation through sexual intercourse does not suggest that whole populations will prefer to reproduce asexually through cloning . the only significant lack of diversity which can be expected will be in women who suffer from a severe mitochondrial disease . they will be able to use cloning by nuclear transfer in order to avoid passing on the disease which is carried in their egg cells to any offspring . this elimination of harmful genetic traits from the gene pool is no different from the eradication of infectious disease such as <eos>

<s> human clones will not reduce human biological diversity <eos>
