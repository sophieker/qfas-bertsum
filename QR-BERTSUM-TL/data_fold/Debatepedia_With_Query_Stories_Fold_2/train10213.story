<s> exploration : is space an important frontier for human exploration/inspiration ? <eos>

<s> . rather than probing mars for life we should be looking to the 95 % of the world s oceans that have yet to be explored and where we are constantly finding new forms of life and new scientific discoveries . for example bacteria have been found which survive not by using sunlight as an energy source but volcanic vents on the ocean floor a discovery which made scientists looking for life on mars totally change their approach . and with individuals constantly in the news for attempts to traverse the globe in rowing boats hot air balloons and tied to gliders there are clearly enough boundaries on this planet to keep even our keenest explorers happy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is sufficient room for exploration on earth ; space is excessive <eos>
