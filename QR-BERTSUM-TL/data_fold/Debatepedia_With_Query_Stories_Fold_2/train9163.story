<s> morality : is child labor immoral ? would the ban ameliorate the moral issue ? <eos>

<s> exporters owners of factories multinational companies and other wealthy actors benefit from child labour as they are - mostly thanks to inadequate or non-existent legislation - free to exploit children in poor countries . it ruins the childhood and future development of these young laborers which is inconsistent with our `` western '' values convention on the rights of the child etc . <eos>

@highlight

<s> child labour equals exploitation . <eos>
