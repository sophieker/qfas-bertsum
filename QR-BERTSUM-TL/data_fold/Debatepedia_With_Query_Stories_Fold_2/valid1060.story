<s> defining `` denial '' : can holocaust denial be appropriately defined so as to outlaw it ? <eos>

<s> most holocaust denial claims imply or openly state that the holocaust is a conspiracy arising out of a deliberate jews conspiracy to advance the interest of jews at the expense of other peoples . for this reason holocaust denial is generally considered to be an antisemitic conspiracy theory . the methodologies of holocaust deniers are criticized as based on a predetermined conclusion that ignores extensive historical evidence to the contrary . this is different than historical revisionists that dispute only the numbers of those killed or certain methods used but whom do not dispute that the event occurred and whom do not argue that the holocaust is a jews conspiracy . this straightforward definition and distinction of `` holocaust denial '' can be quickly applied to <eos>

@highlight

<s> holocaust deniers are those calling it a hoax and jewish conspiracy . <eos>
