<s> banning categories : is it ok to ban whole categories of arms such as handguns in dc ? <eos>

<s> there is a precedent for banning citizens from purchasing specific gun classes such as fully-automatic weapons and heavy weaponry such as grenades and bazookas . it is therefore not reasonable to argue that it is unconstitutional to ban a class of arms such as handguns ; it has already been done and is not disputed in many cases ( such as with bazookas ) . the question therefore is simply whether banning handguns fits the reasonableness standard in the district of columbia . <eos>

@highlight

<s> since other gun classes have been banned so too can handguns for reasonable ends . <eos>
