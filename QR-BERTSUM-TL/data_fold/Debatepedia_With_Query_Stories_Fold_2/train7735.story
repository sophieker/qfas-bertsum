<s> quality of life : does `` do n't ask do n't tell '' improve or harm gay troop quality of life ? <eos>

<s> `` do n't ask do n't tell '' is fair in the sense that commanders and officers alike are barred from asking about the sexuality of soldiers . this levels the playing field to a certain extent . it means that commanders and officers can not alienate and persecute soldiers out of speculation that they may be gay . this was the compromise that was struck when bill clinton sought to enable gays in the military but was met with heavy resistance . restrictions on officers and commanders inquiring about the orientation of members of the military was an improvement over the previous policy which forbid gays and allowed overt inquires and persecutions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> commanders/officers also can not ask about orientation . <eos>
