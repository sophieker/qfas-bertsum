<s> is prostitutes a criminalized crime ? <eos>

<s> assuming that problems of violence abuse and sexually transmitted disease can be resolved with sufficient government regulation ( and it should be mentioned that these are not the reason why prostitution is illegal ) then who is the victims in prostitution ? the prostitute that enjoys here profession ( some do some do n't but room must be left in the law for those that enjoy it ) ? the customers that is willing to pay for sex ? society at large ? whose rights have been violated ? the problem is that it is very difficult or subjective to determine a specific victims which is an important part of determining that a crime has been committed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> prostitution is a victimless crimes <eos>
