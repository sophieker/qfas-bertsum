<s> insurgents fight : is the us presence failing to fighting the insurgents there ? <eos>

<s> this is a commonly argument against the began presence of coalition forces in iraq . it is particularly pertinent in regards to the anti-occupation insurgents in iraq which is focused by definition on fighting coalition forces and expelling them from iraq . if us forces withdraw most insurgents will stop fighting and violence in the country will be thereby reduced as a result . <eos>

@highlight

<s> overseas troops are doing more harms than good in afghanistan <eos>
