<s> history : were palestinians forced out or flee on own will ? <eos>

<s> according to some sources palestinian flight from israel was not compelled but was predominantly voluntary as a result of seven arab nations declaring war on israel in 1948. many arab leaders encouraged and even ordered palestinians to evacuate the battle zone in order to make it easier for the arab armies and fedayeen to demolish the newly found jewish state and israel officially denies any responsibility for the palestinian exodus stating that their flight was caused by the arab invasion . karsh states that most palestinians chose their status as refugees themselves and therefore israel is therefore absolved of responsibility . <eos>
