<s> could nato withstand the difficulties faced by the low cost of expansion ? <eos>

<s> the us defence expenditures alone for the fiscal year # is $ # billion . further the incorrect equations is not between the expense of redeployment troops in these new states and the current save from non-deployment . the balances is between the expense of forward deployment or other military investment and the prohibitive cost in dollars and lives from a conflict between nato and russia or a conflagration in any of the northern republics . nato expansion is nothing more than a cost-effective insurance policy against a very real risk . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the expense of nato expansions is marginal when compared to the defense budgets of the major nato force . <eos>
