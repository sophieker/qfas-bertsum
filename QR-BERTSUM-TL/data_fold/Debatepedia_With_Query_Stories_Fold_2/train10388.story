<s> in korea : are landmines unnecessary between south and north korea ? <eos>

<s> this is an important fact in defenses of the united states ' policies . it illustrates that the united states uses landmines only for a specific zone in a single country rather than deploying landmines in a widespread effort . this is important because most of the costs associated with landmines relate to the broad use of them in wars zone and civilian areas . the united states is certainly not doing this in korea . we policy therefore is not prone to the many arguments against landmines . <eos>

@highlight

<s> landmines in the korea nat do not threatens civilians <eos>
