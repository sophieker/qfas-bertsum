<s> schools : do students vouchers improve the quality of schools ? <eos>

<s> the keys differences between a k- # and a university system is that the u.s. university system receives a substantial portion of its funding from students and subsidies to students in the form of scholarships government grant and subsidized loans . this is argued to be conceptually equivalent to school vouchers because the money is provided ultimately to the student and in such a way that the student 's ability to choosing between schools is maintained . because choice is maintain universities must compete harder to attract students which many proponents argue is the keys ingredient in the relative success of the universities system over the k- # system . thus some argue that a similar competition-inducing approach should be taken with the k- # system through <eos>

@highlight

<s> universities succeeding because they are more like vouchers system . <eos>
