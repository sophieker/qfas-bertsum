<s> globally warming crisis : is solar shaded a reasonable solution ? <eos>

<s> by reducing the amount of sunlight that enters the atmosphere solar shading decreasing the amount of energy offered to solar energy cells . this is causes for concern because solar energy is a major source of # -emission powers and so a significant solution to the globally warming crisis . to diminish this solution is to weaken the fight against globally warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> discontinuing photovoltaic shading could result in rapidly warming <eos>
