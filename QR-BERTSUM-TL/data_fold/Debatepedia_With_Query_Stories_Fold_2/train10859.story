<s> individual rights : does an individual not have a `` right '' to gun ownership ? <eos>

<s> in the court case heller v district of columbia the court ruled that the right to bear arms has always existed and that the court case only affirms that right . in addition the right to bear arms is not dependent on militia service or that the right is individual and not collective . the six plantifs of heller v district of columbia were thus now legally able to own previously forbidden firearms . in response the city leaders reclassified handguns into the same category as machine guns . it is also impractical to own more than four guns ; even if the person is a hunter . <eos>
