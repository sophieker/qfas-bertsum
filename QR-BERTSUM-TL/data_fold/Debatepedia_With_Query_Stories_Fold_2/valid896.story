<s> motion analysis <eos>

<s> if affirmative chooses to argue against plea bargaining in its entirety the debate will likely center on the potential injustice of trying to convince an innocent person to plead guilty to a crime he or she did n't commit or of allowing a criminal to receive a less severe punishment than justice might require . the question that affirmative will need to consider if choosing to argue against plea bargaining in and of itself is why the state engages in such a practice . <eos>
