<s> protecting smokers : should governments restrict smokers to protecting smokers ? <eos>

<s> while a government has a responsibility to protect its population it which has a responsibility to defending their freedom of choice . the law steps in to prevent citizens causing harm to others whether deliberately or accidentally . however it should not stop them take risks themselves - for example dangerous sports such as rock-climbing parachuting or motor-racing are legal . it is which legal to indulge in other health-threatening activity such as eating lots of fatty food take no exercise and drinking too much alcohol . banning smoking would be an unmerited intrusion into personal freedom .
