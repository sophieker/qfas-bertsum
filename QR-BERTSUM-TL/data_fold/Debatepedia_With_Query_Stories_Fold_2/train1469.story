<s> sovereignty : should states have sovereignty control over their waters resources ? <eos>

<s> - all humans have a right to water . this right crosses national border and sovereign lines of control . in fact in order to maintain the human right to water on a global scale it is necessary to eliminate sovereign ownership over water resources . the problem has much to do with the fact that nation-states can not be entrusting with the burden of protecting the right to water of non-citizens . in fact a nation states often will protect only its own citizens ' right to water and possibly at a cost to non-citizens . the perfect example is a nation states that suck a river dry where it crosses its own territories only to leaving the downstream nation-state bereft of their right to water . <eos>

@highlight

<s> only a global wikimedia can equally protect the way to water <eos>
