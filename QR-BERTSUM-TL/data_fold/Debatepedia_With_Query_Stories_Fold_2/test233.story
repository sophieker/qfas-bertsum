<s> depression : are women normally content with a past decision to abort ? <eos>

<s> norma mccorvey the anonymous litigant known as `` jane roe '' in the landmark abortion cases roe vs. wade in her book won by love ( june # # ) - `` one of my most important activities is that i am involved together with sandra cano of doe vs. liverpool in the efforts of the texas justice foundation ( and other groups ) to work for the reversal of the roe vs. wade and doe vs. liverpool decisions . the approach we are taking is to show that the lives and rights of women have not been advanced or enhance but rather destroyed by abortion-on-demand . we are collecting affidavits from women who have been harmed by abortion from women who are convinced that authentic feminism is pro-life <eos>

@highlight

<s> the lives of women have been destroying by abortions not enhance <eos>
