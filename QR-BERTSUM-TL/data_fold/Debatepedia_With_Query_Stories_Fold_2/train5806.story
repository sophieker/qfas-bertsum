<s> hugo chavez : were any calls for assassinating hugo chavez justified ? <eos>

<s> the argument that chavez - and any other political leader who stands up and faces down us hegemony - should be assassinated is predicated on the rather base belief that as the usa is currently the most powerful military complex on the planet it should be allowed to decide who lives and who dies . in fact if we are being more precise we should say that as the most powerful interests in the usa are in command of the most powerful military complex on the planet they should be allowed to decide who lives and who dies in the pursuit of consolidation and extension of their privileges . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assassinating chavez would be based only on us hegemony . <eos>
