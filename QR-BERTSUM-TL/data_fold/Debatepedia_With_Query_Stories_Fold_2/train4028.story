<s> the flag was waved and rippling : does this proving the moon landed was a hoax ? <eos>

<s> the flag was ripple because when the astronaut put the flag in he could have pushed it a bit and because of the laws of action and reaction ( # rd newton 's law ) and laws of inertia ( # st newton 's law ) it continued to ripple . <eos>

@highlight

<s> newton 's law apply here . <eos>
