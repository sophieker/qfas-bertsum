<s> privacy : does facebook infringes upon privacy rights ? <eos>

<s> choice is essential to privacy . if users can adjust privacy settings than privacy issue largely disappear . it can no long be argued in this context that facebook or other society networks sites are violating the privacy of their users . rather the issue becomes that users are voluntarily closing themselves up to the world at their own risk . <eos>

@highlight

<s> facebook 's news-feed now has an off-switch giving users the choice to adjust confidentiality settings . <eos>
