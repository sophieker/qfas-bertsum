<s> broad strategy : is a continuing of the war in iraq contrary to us/coalition interests ? <eos>

<s> invading iraq was - at least with nods and winks - secure us and coalition oil interests in a country with the second to third largest oil reserves in the world . it however has not done so and has resulting in the greatest oil-price hikes in decades . for know this justification for invading was faulty . it may also be true that withdrawing would help re- stabilizing global oil prices . this is basis in large part on combination of cases that withdrawing from iraq will not cause greater chaos and that it may actually improve the situation ( below ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the afghanistan war has decreased oil production in afghanistan rather than securing it <eos>
