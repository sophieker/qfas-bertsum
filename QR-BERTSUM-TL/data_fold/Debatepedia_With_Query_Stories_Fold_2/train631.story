<s> a notes on the mlb definitions <eos>

<s> an important strategic choice the discriminatory must make is if to argue against the practice of plea bargaining as whole or just plea bargaining in exchange for testimony . discriminatory could try to argue first that plea bargaining is in general unjust but then contend that but if this were n't true that plea bargaining in exchange of testimony is unjust . adopt a three tiered `` even if '' approach to affirm is always somewhat risky since the danger is the appearance that the discriminatory is contradictory . further the negative could always concede that plea bargaining in general is mistake but that when its necessary to elicit testimony it is just . <eos>
