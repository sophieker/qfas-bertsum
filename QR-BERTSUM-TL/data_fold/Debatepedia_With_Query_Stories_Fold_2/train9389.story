<s> environment/general : is photovoltaic energy generally environmentally friendly ? <eos>

<s> almost all modern sources of electricity use the sun 's electricity but in a very indirect way . oil is the byproduct of organic matter that grows via the power of the sun . wind electricity is the product of the sun causing thermal variables in the earth 's atmosphere . yet why not just exploit the sun 's electricity directly with photovoltaic cells ? this is more efficient . <eos>

@highlight

<s> photovoltaic power is the most direct form of use the sun 's energy . <eos>
