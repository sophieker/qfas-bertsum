<s> users : is graduated response respectful to users ? <eos>

<s> it is important that movie watchers and music fans understand how these industries work and how copyright laws are essential to their future . graduated response can be viewed as an educational campaign as much as a warning and punitive system for establishing a new respect and cultural appreciation for how these industries and artists make money . because so many young people do n't understand these fundamentals and take them for granted such an educational push and cultural shift is very important . <eos>

@highlight

<s> graduated response educates fans about copyright/arts . <eos>
