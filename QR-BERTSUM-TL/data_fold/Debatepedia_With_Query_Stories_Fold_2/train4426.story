<s> stability : does gay marriage encourage stable relationships ? <eos>

<s> most homosexuals are not interested in the restrictions and commitments of marriage . this simply argues against the notion that offering marriage will have a widespread stabilizing effect . since very few gays will opt for it little stability will be gained within the relatively promiscuous gay community . <eos>

@highlight

<s> most gays do n't care for marriage commitments . <eos>
