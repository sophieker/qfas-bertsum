<s> economics : is natural fuel financially superior ? <eos>

<s> the major difficulty in the use of natural gas is transportation and storage . this is due to its low density . it is generally less efficiency and more expensive to transport and stores sources of energy that have a low level of latent energy per cubic meter . there is less return on each dollar spent in transporting and storing natural gas . those existing pipeline in north america are close to reaching their capacity prompting some legislators representing colder areas to speak publicly of potential shortages . <eos>
