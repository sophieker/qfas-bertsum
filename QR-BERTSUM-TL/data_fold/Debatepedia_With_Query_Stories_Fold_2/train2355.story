<s> soldiers : would an early withdrawal honor us soldiers ? <eos>

<s> under the assumption that most troops in iraq are suffering from severe anxiety psychiatric trauma and risk of death it is no surprise that troops would prefer to come home . a timetable would give troops something to look forward to and subsequently boost morale not decrease it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> setting a timetable would boost troop morale not damage it <eos>
