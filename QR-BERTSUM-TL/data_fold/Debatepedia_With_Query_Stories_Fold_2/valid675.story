<s> humans rights : is health care a humans right ? <eos>

<s> universal health care generally decreases human misery and decreases human welfare . it is therefore a society good not merely an economic good . in general the ability to afford something does not play a roles in whether it is just or not . if there is a conflict between life and cash life should prevail because it is a right while cash is a want not a need . <eos>
