<s> rebate re-vote : does a rebate re-vote concepts make sense ? <eos>

<s> on marches # th # the florida democratic party rejected the idea of holding a re-vote of any kind . this means that but if there is a justification for doing so it wo n't happen . it also means that there is not most will in florida to make it happen which would make it particularly inappropriate to try to push forward a re-vote . <eos>
