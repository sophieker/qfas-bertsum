<s> blockade : is gaza blockade legal ? was raid just on these grounds ? <eos>

<s> thomas friedman . `` when friends fall out . '' new york times . june 1 2010 : `` it is overwhelmingly in israel s interest to bring more diplomatic imagination and energy to ending this gaza siege . how long is this going to go on ? are we going to have a whole new generation grow up in gaza with israel counting how many calories they each get ? that surely can t be in israel s interest . israel has gotten so good at controlling the palestinians that it could get comfortable with an arrangement that will not only erode its own moral fabric but increase its international isolation . it may be that hamas will give israel no other choice but israel could show a lot more <eos>

@highlight

<s> blockade of gaza is generally contrary to israel 's interests <eos>
