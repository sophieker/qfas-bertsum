<s> wallstreet : will a $ # bailout go towards benefiting greedy capitalists ? <eos>

<s> the nature of the $ # b bail-out does not by its nature bail-out wallstreet fat-cats . it is not a money giveaway to wallstreet banks . it involves rather government and taxpayers purchasing mortgage assets . these asset are then owned by the government and taxpayers and can but later be sold for a profit for taxpayers . this is therefore obviously not a cash-giveaway to wallstreet fat-cats . <eos>

@highlight

<s> $ # b is no wallstreet giveaway but a taxpayer investment . <eos>
