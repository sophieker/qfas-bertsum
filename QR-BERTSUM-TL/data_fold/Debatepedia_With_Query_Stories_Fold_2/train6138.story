<s> cultural preserving - should whaling be allowed in order to preserve the various cultural practice surrounding it ? <eos>

<s> involving driving whales to beach themselves and then killing them gradually with long knives or singling out vulnerable nursing mothers with calves . as only small numbers are taken with relatively primitive equipment the hunters do not develop enough skill or possess the technology to achieve clean and quick kills so unnecessary suffer is inevitable . and what if the whales these groups wish to hunting are from the most endangered species should they be allowed to go ahead simply because of their cultural heritage ? in any cases there are many traditional practices ( e.g . slaves female circumcision ) which have been outlawed as abhorrent in modern society .
