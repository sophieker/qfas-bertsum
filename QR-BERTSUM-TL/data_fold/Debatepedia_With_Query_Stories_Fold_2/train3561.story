<s> politicizing olympics : is it acceptable to politicize the olympics with boycotts ? <eos>

<s> `` our tibet protests wo n't work '' . washington post post global . april 14th 2008 - `` on this issue the bush administration has so far followed a wiser course forgoing the grandstanding taking place in europe and on the campaign trail . it has been urging the chinese government quietly but firmly to engage in serious discussions with the dalai lama . diplomacy can be scoffed at but every multinational business that has had success in persuading the chinese government to change course will testify that public humiliation does not work nearly as well on the regime as private pressure . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> china will not reform as a result of olympic boycott <eos>
