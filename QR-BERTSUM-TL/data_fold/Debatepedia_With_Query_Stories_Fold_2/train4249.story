<s> effect on companies : is a `` fat tax '' fair to companies that produce fatty foods ? <eos>

<s> companies that sell fatty products would suffer from lower consumption of their goods assuming that a fat tax would have the desired effect of lowering the consumption of such goods . yet these companies would complain that they have done nothing wrong and do not deserve such governmental penalization of their product-line . they would argue that in a market economy their company should not be punished for merely supplying what the market demands . <eos>

@highlight

<s> restaurants and food-producers will suffer from a fat tax . <eos>
