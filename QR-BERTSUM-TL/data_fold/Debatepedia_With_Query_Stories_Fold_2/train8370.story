<s> equality : which is good at fostering gender dealing with inequality ? <eos>

<s> as jefferson d. roosevelt 's famous saying goes : `` capitalism is unequally divided riches while socialism is similarly divided poverty . '' in other words socialism may be more equals but that is not a better result when everyone is poor . it is better that there be some inequality under capitalism when everyone is more wealthy and prosperous . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalist is unequal riches ; socialism is equals inequality <eos>
