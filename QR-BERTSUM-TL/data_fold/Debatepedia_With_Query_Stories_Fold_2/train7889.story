<s> harm : is the wearing of the muslim veil harmful ? <eos>

<s> a piece of cloth on the head of a person ca n't practically harm anyone physically . if any psychological disturbance or fear is aroused in anyone due to the action of wearing hijab then that fear is irrational and the topic who experiences it needs to be educated . the particular citizens in france who have the so-called `` islamophobia '' should be given a course which explains to them in detail the irrationality of their belief or fear . passing a law that tells muslims not to wear hijab for someone else 's baseless fear is targeted the stimulus for the disease and not the disease either . <eos>

@highlight

<s> muslim veils can not harm anybody mentally and should not harm anybody emotionally . <eos>
