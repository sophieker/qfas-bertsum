<s> theodore roosevelt theodore roosevelt an autobiography - `` almost any criminal however brutal has usually some person often a person whom he has greatly wronged who will plead for him . if the mother is alive she will always come and she can not help feeling that the case in which she is so concerned is peculiar that in this case a pardon should be granted . it was really heartrending to have to see the kinfolk and friends of murderers who were condemned to death and among the very rare occasions when anything governmental or official caused me to lose sleep were times when i had to listen to some poor mother making a plea for a criminal so wicked so utterly brutal <eos>
