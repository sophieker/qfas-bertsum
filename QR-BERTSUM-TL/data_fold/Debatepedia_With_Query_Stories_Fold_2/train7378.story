<s> self-determination : does tibet have the way to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> while tibet may have good reasons to complaining about its circumstances under china its circumstances are not that bad . bad would be the mass genocide and murder of tibetans . there are relatively few fatalities in tibets case on account of the chinese government 's police presence there . the main concerns are that many tibetans have been exiled they are topic to some human rights abuses they are deprived of their leader the dalai lama . these may be bad problems but they are not egregious in the grand global perspective of genocides and mass murders that are occurring . given the international communities ' limited ability to respond to international grievances the tibetan case simply does not qualify for immediate attention . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a right to self-determination should only be offer for especially grievous circumstances which does not include tibet . <eos>
