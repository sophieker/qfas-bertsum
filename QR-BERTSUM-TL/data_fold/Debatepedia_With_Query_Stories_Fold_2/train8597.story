'' the future of freedom . march 1993 : `` socialism 's failure in the former soviet union and in the other socialist countries stands as a clear and unquestionable warning as to which path any rational and sane people should never follow again . government planning brought poverty and ruin . the idea of collectivist class and ethnic group-rights produced tens of millions of deaths and a legacy of civil war and conflict . and nationalized social services generated social decay and political privilege and corruption .
