<s> if science gives bacteria `` living status '' should n't at least the same priority apply to a ( n ) embryo/fetus ? <eos>

<s> . all organism in the scientific `` kingdoms '' of monera protista fungi plantae and animalia are deemed alive by science when their cells are functioning replicating having the chemical processes etc . even one-celled organism `` protists '' are deemed alive and to an even greate extent bacteria and virus which are n't even one sustainability cell but microscopic parasites are still deemed alive . with all classifications of life being granted to cells and even pseudo-cells that have chemical processes occuring within them energy being used and reproducing of the cell happening : why are n't multi-celled human embryos and fetuses being deemed `` alive '' ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is general understanding that all science said that bacteria viruses protists fungus are living <eos>
