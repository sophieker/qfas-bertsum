<s> changes : is it possible to make appropriate changes to a bill of rights ? <eos>

<s> is the constitution to be unchangeable ? if so then it is a supreme example of a societies arrogance and a minefield of future problems for example those which might be caused by new scientific discoveries . if not who can change them ? if judges then they are undemocratically appointed and do not represent the wish of the people . if decided by a popular vote the it undermines the entire principle of unalienable rights as the bill will become subject to the tyranny of the majority that it was supposed to counter . the proposition has tied itself in logical and legal knots making the exercise of a bill not only impossible in theory but dangerous in practice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an unchanging bill of rights can enshrine bad principles . <eos>
