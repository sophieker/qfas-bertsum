<s> enforcement : is a ban on incest unenforceable ? <eos>

<s> the law should not consider the expediency of enforcement . the question is only whether a law is just . in the case of incest a ban is just for the reasons presented here so is justified . it does not matter that enforcement of the law may be difficult or appear harsh on those that violate the law . if individuals decide that they are above the law and able to violate it they should be punished in the same way as any other individual . <eos>

@highlight

<s> difficult enforcement is no cause for legalizing incest . <eos>
