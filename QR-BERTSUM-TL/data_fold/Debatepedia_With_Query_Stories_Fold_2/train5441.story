<s> non-profit : is it important that co-ops are non-profits ? <eos>

<s> michael leavitt . `` health 'co-ops ' are government care '' . wall street journal . august 20 2009 : `` our health-care system needs real reform [ not co-ops ] . we need to abolish the unfair tax that favors employer-sponsored insurance over self-purchased insurance . we need to foster a more vibrant private market with greater competition and choice . we need to make prices transparent and give consumers more freedom to pursue health-care value . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> insurance industry needs more competition not co-ops <eos>
