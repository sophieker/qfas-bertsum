<s> abuse : is the vetoed powers topic to individual interests ? <eos>

<s> the america states has protected israel from international condemnation in the un sc hundreds of times . the condemnation has surrounding such things as israel 's alleged oppression of palestinians or abuses and international law violations in its war against hezbollah in lebanon . there are too many instances in which israeli abuses and violations of international law were fairly ok. us defenses of israel in these instances therefore constitute a abusive and opportunist attempt to protect an ally . this all exposes how the un sc veto opens the door to abuse . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the united states unjustly protect israel with un veto <eos>
