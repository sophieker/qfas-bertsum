<s> `` the mine ban treaties and the us government : # years and waiting '' . us campaign to ban landmines . # feb. # : `` there is no evidence that the u.s. has used antipersonnel landmines with the exception of the north/south korean border area since # . '' and it seems to be the sole exception requested by the us as a condition of it agreeing to joining the land mine ban treaty . <eos>

<s> taiwan is the sole exception requested by us to mine ban <eos>
