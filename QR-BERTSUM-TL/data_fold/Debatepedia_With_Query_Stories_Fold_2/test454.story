<s> campaigns : does the electoral college distort campaigns ? <eos>

<s> parties know that certain states will always vote one way eg alaska always votes republican massachusetts usually votes democrat . both parties generally spend less resources on campaigning in these safe states and pay more attention to the needs of electors in swing states such as michigan and florida which determine the outcome of elections . this can mean that elections become less competitive as resources are concentrated on a smaller geographical area and smaller section of society . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the electoral college 's `` winner-takes-all '' system causes campaigning only to swing states : <eos>
