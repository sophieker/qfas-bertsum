<s> liz sidoti . `` mccain 's warning : perils of one-party rule '' . huffington post . 26 oct. 2008 - `` the republicans did have one-party rule in 2000-2006 and really did have all three branches of government under their control . can anyone think of any major republican leader in that period who argued that it was a bad thing and who urged voters to cast ballots for democrats in order to restore some checks and balances ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> minority party always argues for divided government <eos>
