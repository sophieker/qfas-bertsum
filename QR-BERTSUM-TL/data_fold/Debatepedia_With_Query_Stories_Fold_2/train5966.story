<s> even if iran opts not to use a nuclear weapon there are major additional risks . it 's possessions of a nuclear weapon would make it much more likely to act aggressive in the global system through traditional means or through its sponsorship of terrorism . nuclear weapons will support such aggression because it will make other states think twice about responding aggressive out of fear that iran will then responding with nuclear strikes . <eos>
