<s> ocean ecosystems : does iron fertilisation preserve ocean ecosystems ? <eos>

<s> `` a scientific critique of oceanic iron fertilization as a climate changing mitigation strategy '' . greenpeace research laboratories . september # - `` iron fertilization result in other essential nutrients such as nitrates phosphates ad silicates being use up as the phytoplankton bloom progresses . consequently this could result in a reduction of these nutrients down-current from an iron- fertilized area . in turn a lack of nutrients would cause a negative impact on phytoplankton down-current resulting in a reduction in improved biological productivity . this would be likely to have a knock-on negative impact on all other marine life because phytoplankton underpin the marine food web . indeed because of this phenomenon modeling studies have predicted that commercial-scale iron fertilization of the ocean could have a significant <eos>
