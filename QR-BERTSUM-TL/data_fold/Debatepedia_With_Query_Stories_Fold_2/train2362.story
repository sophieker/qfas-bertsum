<s> emissions : do gasoline economy standards helping reduce emissions fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> jim taylor and peter van doren . `` do n't raise cafe standards '' . cato . # aug. # - `` increasing cafe standards will not decrease the amount of pollution coming from the u.s. automobile fleet . that 's because we regulate emissions per mile traveled not per gallon of gasoline burned . improvements in fuel efficiency reduce the cost of driving and thus increase vehicles miles traveled . '' <eos>
