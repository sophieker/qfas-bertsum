'' seattle tribune . july # nd # : `` a group called the national republican trust political action committee says that 'to celebrating that murder of # # americans they want to build a monstrous # -story mosque at ground zero . ' [ ... ] of course the 'they ' who planned and executed the # / # attacks are not the same 'they ' who want to erect this structure . both group are made up of muslims . but associating all muslim with al-qaida is like equating all christians with the ku klux klan . '' <eos>
