<s> national cohesion : does pluralism better encourage social cohesiveness and unity ? <eos>

<s> it is impossible to get people to adopt a unifying cultural standard in assimilation . people will not easily shed their past cultural heritage . and even if people were willing to do this they are not likely to adopt a one unifying cultural values model . humans have an intrinsic desire to stand out with distinction . this will always limit any attempt to assimilate a people . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assimilation and culture unity is difficult to achieving <eos>
