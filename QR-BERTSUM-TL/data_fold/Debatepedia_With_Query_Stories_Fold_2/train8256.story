<s> global law : can assassinations of tyrants be justified in global law ? <eos>

<s> by what prerogative would the usa feel itself best placed to decide which democratically elected national leadership should be assassinated ? presumably such a decision would be based entirely on ideological grounds ( as far as the media and the publicj were concerned ) and economy grounds ( as far as the legislators and their corporations boss were concerned ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assassination attempts are driving by invalid ideological considerations . <eos>
