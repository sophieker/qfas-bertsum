<s> church and state : does the monarchies violate separation of church and state ? <eos>

<s> while many argue that the monarchy in australia is unconstitutional due to its connection with the anglican church this erroneously assumes that the constitution states a separation of church and state . it does n't . therefore any anglican church influence in australia is probably not at odds with the constitution . so at leas the monarchy 's anglican connection is not creating a constitution crisis in australia . as to whether a separation between church and state should exists ( as opposed to the existing policy of `` neutrality '' ) that is a question that has nothing to do with the crown 's policy and can not be held against it ; it is a question about the australian constitution . <eos>

<s> australia constitution does not separate of church and state ; monarchies is o.k . <eos>
