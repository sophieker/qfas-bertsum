<s> deterrence : can nuclear power maintain deterrence under a nuclear tests ban ? <eos>

<s> `` kissinger shultz perry & nunn calling for a world free of nuclear weapons '' . the wall street journal . february # # > `` nuclear weapons were essential to maintaining global security during the cold war because they were a means of deterrence . the end of the cold war made the doctrine of mutual soviet-american deterrence obsolete . deterrence continue to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states . but reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective . '' [ therefore in so far as the ctbt might damage the nuclear capabilities of a state it will be irrelevant as the need for nuclear deterrence is much smaller today . ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear deterrence is less relevant today ; test ban does little damage <eos>
