<s> rights : which system better protects individual rights and counters discrimination ? <eos>

<s> democracy is built upon the notion that individuals may hold different beliefs and that they have the right to do so . in a democratic election there is usually a more conservative group competing with a more liberal group ; in the united states this would be the republicans versus the democrats . democracies are built upon individuals and groups believing different things but coexisting . similarly a multicultural society acknowledges respects and even cherishes differences between groups . realistically societies are pluralistic . because of its parallel with democracy multiculturalism seems to be a more suitable and appropriate framework for a democratic society . <eos>

@highlight

<s> multiculturalism is democratic <eos>
