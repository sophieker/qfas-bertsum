<s> position : what is obama 's position ? has it been constant or shifted ? <eos>

<s> meetings without `` preconditions '' does not mean meetings with rogue leaders without any specific purposes in mind that relates to us and global interests . additionally a willingness to meet with rogue leaders is not a promise to meet . obama has not committing to meetings with all rogue leaders . he has only said that he is willing to meet without setting pre-conditions concerning the behavior of those states . an important condition on all meetings remains : that it be within us strategic interests to meet and work toward something . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama is only willing to meet rogue leaders when it 's in we interests . <eos>
