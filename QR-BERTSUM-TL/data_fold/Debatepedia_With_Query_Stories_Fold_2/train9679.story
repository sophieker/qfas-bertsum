<s> history : does history proving democratic to be the best forms of government ? <eos>

<s> modern democratic ( as opposed to classical athenian democratic ) is a facade . true democratic can only be practised on a very large scale . in britain for example whilst people be vote every five years they have no input into decision beyond either . this is the desirable state of things but it is not democracy . our previous state of government would be far more effective if it abandon its pretences at representativity . <eos>

@highlight

<s> modern democratic does n't working well . <eos>
