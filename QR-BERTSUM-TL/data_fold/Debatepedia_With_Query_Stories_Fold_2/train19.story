<s> economics : is tidal energy strong and viable economically ? <eos>

<s> the net capacity factor of a powers plant is the ratio of the actual output of a powers plant period over its output if it could operate at the full capacity of the installed generator . tidal energy has a very low capacity factor because tidal energy production peak infrequently in the day . this meaning that a tidal energy plant could have the same turbine and generators as a hydroelectric dam but produce half the electricity . because it takes the same amount of cash to build and install these generators the returns on investment in tidal energy plants would be about half that of hydroelectric plants . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tidal power has a high capacity factor ( poor return-on-investment ) <eos>
