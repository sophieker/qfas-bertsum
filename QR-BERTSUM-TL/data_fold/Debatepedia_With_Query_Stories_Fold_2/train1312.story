<s> developing growth : will developing world growth negate developed state cuts ? <eos>

<s> kyoto protocol exempted developing countries such as china from meeting certain key emissions standards . the problem is that the new emissions from china would offset all emissions cuts from developed nations . as a result the world under kyoto protocol would/will emit roughly the same amount and make little progress to cutting emissions overall . this is unacceptable . developed countries can not be expected to lead on climate change under such circumstances . they are forced into a situation in which they must ask `` what 's the point ? '' for which there is no reply . <eos>

@highlight

<s> developing country exemptions negate developed country leadership <eos>
