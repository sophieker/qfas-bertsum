<s> student measurement : are standardized tests a great measure of student learning ? <eos>

<s> standardized testing often tests only a very limited range of skills rather than the broad range of skills we would hope our educational system is teaching . standardized testing focuses largely on memorization speed of recall and critical thinking . yet a full education entails much more including creativity emotional insight composure and dignity physical health and an understanding of nutrition and many other basics human values . nclb therefore does not measure the most important factors in a student 's education and potential successful and happiness . it is therefore worthless as a measure of a student and school 's performance . <eos>
