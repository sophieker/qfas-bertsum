<s> researching it : is geoengineering important to research keep on table ? <eos>

<s> there is the possibility of devastating long term effects if natural cycles or processes are interrupted or thrown off by geoengineering techniques . if the balance of nature is upset it could result in natural disasters such as drought famine or extreme weather situations brought on by sudden changes in the composition of the atmosphere . all natural disasters cause disruption in the political system of a country . money has to be expended to try to minimize the loss of life research has to be paid for to find out what caused the disaster and what could prevent it from happening in the future and politicians will have conflicting and ever changing ideas about what should be done and to what extent <eos>

@highlight

<s> geoengineering tests/consequences distract from other problems . <eos>
