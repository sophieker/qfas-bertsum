<s> ethnicity : do the s. ossetian 's have a distinct national identity ? <eos>

<s> as a principle borders should be coming down around the world not going up . this promotes greater integration tolerance and a higher worldview globally . an independent s. ossetia would create more borders and would be therefore bad in this way . while the principle of self-determination sounds attractive it must be balanced against this valuable principle as well . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the world needs fewer borders ; a s. ossetian nation adds more . <eos>
