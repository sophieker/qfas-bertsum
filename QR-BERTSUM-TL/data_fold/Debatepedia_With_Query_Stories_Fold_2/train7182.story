<s> democracy : are the primaries adequately democratic ? <eos>

<s> in the last `` super delegates '' have been a way for the democratic party to secure a candidates at their convention . these elected officials making up a significant portions of the delegates and are not bound to voting for a particular candidates besides who they want to voting for them . this means that the electorate has no influence on who these `` super delegates '' voting for . in a close election this can mean a small number of those with no cement ties to the electorate will decide the democratic candidates for the general election . <eos>

@highlight

<s> difficult secondary elections create confusion abroad <eos>
