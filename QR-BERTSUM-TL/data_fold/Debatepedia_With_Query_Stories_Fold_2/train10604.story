<s> crime : does stringent gun-control decrease violence and crime ? <eos>

<s> legal boundaries for gun-ownership may not provide sufficient social protections as many criminals steal legally-owned guns and commit violent crimes or murders with them . these criminals would have greater difficulty in obtain such weapon if firearms were generally less commonplace in society . in other words it is argues that the world would be safe with fewer guns and laws that lead to fewer guns by restricting the right of gun-ownership . <eos>

@highlight

<s> registering guns can often be accessed by non-registered persons <eos>
