<s> timing : is it better to get mba sooner than later ? <eos>

<s> jason price the director of emba world said to mba podcaster : `` when you have those years of work experience under your belt you ve already had successes and failures in life . you already know what it may mean to see a business collapse or dissolve or you see a business succeed or merge or acquired it may have been through a recession or two . that is an education in its own right and when you bring that back into the classroom it provides an entirely different dimension . '' [ 8 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> older mba students bring more experience/perspective . <eos>
