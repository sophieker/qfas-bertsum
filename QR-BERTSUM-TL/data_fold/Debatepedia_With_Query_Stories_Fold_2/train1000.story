<s> support : is the abolishing of reactors weapons widely supported ? <eos>

<s> realy only the countrys that do n't have them acutally trying to abolish them because then they would be equals . however the countries that posses them are in no hurry to spent millions upon millions of dollars to get rid of their most deturent . the world powers may talk about how they want to get rid of them but neither of them acutally want to they are realy just try to seem considerint and kind . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no another who has them complaining about it . <eos>
