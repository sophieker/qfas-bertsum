<s> natural ? is vegetarians natural for humans ? is meat-eating unnatural ? <eos>

<s> like our early ancestors humans have teeth designed for tearing flesh as well as for crushing and chewing vegetable fibres . our stomach are also adapted to eating both meat and vegetable matter . all of this meaning that eating meat is part of being human . like many other species human beings were once hunters . in the wild animals killing and are killed sometimes very brutally and with no idea of rights . as mankind has progressing over thousands of years we have largely stopped hunting wild animals . instead we have discovered gentler and less wasteful ways of getting the meat in our diets through domestication . farm animals today are descended from the animals we once hunted in the wild . <eos>

@highlight

<s> eat meat is completely naturally for omnivorous humans . <eos>
