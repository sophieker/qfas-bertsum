<s> international torture : does the widespread use of torture internationally make it less bad for the west to perform it ? <eos>

<s> - the problem with the heavy criticisms of the use of torture in western countries such as the united states is that it seems to ignore the much more gruesome use of torture in third-world and developing countries . it is as if each instance of torture in a western country would count as worse than the same instance of torture in a third-world or developing country . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the west 's use of torture is trivial compared to many countries <eos>
