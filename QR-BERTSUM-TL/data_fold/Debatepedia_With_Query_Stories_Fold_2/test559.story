<s> rights : which system better protects individual rights and counters discrimination ? <eos>

<s> the politicization of identity has many pitfalls . it risks broad groupings of individuals and the extension of certain rights to some individuals that do n't deserve it . by giving unjustified legal favor to such individuals multiculturalism threatens unjustifiably impeding on the rights of `` ordinary citizens '' that are now put at a disadvantage or whom are forced to help compensate in some way the individuals of the minority group . <eos>

@highlight

<s> multiculturalism politicizes identity in ethnic and religious terms <eos>
