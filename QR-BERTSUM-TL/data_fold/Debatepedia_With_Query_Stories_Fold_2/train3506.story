<s> aggression : does the icc have an specific definition of `` aggression '' ? <eos>

<s> john r. bolton . `` the united states and the global criminal court '' . remark to the federalist society . # nov. # - `` numerous prospective `` crimes '' were suggested at rome and commanded wide support from participating nations such as the crime of `` aggression `` which was included in the statute but not defined . although frequently easy to identify `` aggression '' can at times be something in the eye of the beholder . for example israel justifiably feared in rome that particular actions such as its initial use of force in the six days war could be perceived as immoral pre-emptive strikes that almost certainly could have provoked proceedings against top israeli officials .
