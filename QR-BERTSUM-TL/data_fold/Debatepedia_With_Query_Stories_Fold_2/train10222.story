'' : `` in a concession to the obvious lawmakers exempted bakeries from the ban because they know that it will drive up their costs and hurt their specialty items . but bakeries represent only one category of small business that would be harmed by the legislation . restaurants and other specialty vendors who use trans-fat products on site would also be affected . unfortunately the bill provides them with no such protection . '' <eos>
