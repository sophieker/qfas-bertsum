<s> not torture ? is it wrong to call water-boarding torture ? <eos>

<s> while many supporters of waterboarding defending the practice as `` simulated '' drown waterboarding probably involves water entering the lung until suffocation or near suffocation . this is drown not `` simulated '' drowning . the only differences is that the suspect is not killed or is revive from death . <eos>

<s> water-boarding is drowning not `` simulated '' drowning . <eos>
