<s> aesthetics : does wave power preserve environmental beauty ? <eos>

<s> the difficulty of under-water wave power is that it generally requires being installed further out to see where water is deeper . this requires that transmission lines go farther out to sea which is more expensive . this means that under-water wave power is not a very economically viable solution to the aesthetic issues surrounding wave power . <eos>
