<s> barages : are tidal barages a good idea ? <eos>

<s> bays and estuaries are always naturally `` flushed '' or cleansed and replenished by tide-waters flowing in and out . to the extent that tidal energy impairs the natural flows of these tides it impairs this natural `` flushing '' mechanism . tampering with this mechanism can have unpredictable and even disastrous consequences for an ecosystem . <eos>
