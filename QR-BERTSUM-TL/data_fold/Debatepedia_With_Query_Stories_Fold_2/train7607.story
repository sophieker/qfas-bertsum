<s> health-care costs : would it reduce healthcare care costs ? is this a good or worse thing ? <eos>

<s> while this is again not a driving regard behind abortion it is true that abortion could reduce health care costs . this should be seeing only as an added benefit to implementing the practice . leonard m. fleck professor of philosophy and medical ethics at michigan state university 's medical school . quoted in an april # # new york times article `` the right to suicide some worrying could evolve into a duty to die '' - `` the need for health care rationing is inescapable because the parameters for adding care expand each day ... the moral challenge is to come up with approaches that are closed rational and democratic but that limits marginally advantageous and non-costworthy care . in my opinion there are no good options <eos>
