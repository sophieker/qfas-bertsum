<s> economic effects - would a maximum working week benefit an economy overall ? <eos>

<s> a maximum working week would be economically damaging since it would either force them to spread these fixed costs less efficiently across a smaller output or in order to retain their output they would need to increase their workforce and so labour costs . this would particularly affect small businesses again stifling entrepreneurial activity . a fixed maximum also reduces business flexibility . even if employers do not habitually use their workers for overly long periods it can be beneficial for them to retain the capacity to do so when needed e.g . if a large customer order needs to be filled in a short time .

<s> many business have the same fixed costs regardless of the hours worked . <eos>
