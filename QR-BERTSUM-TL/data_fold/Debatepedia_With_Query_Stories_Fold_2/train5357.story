<s> global law : is torture banned under global law ? <eos>

<s> . michael levin . `` the case for torture '' - `` there is an importance difference between terrorists and their victim that should mute talk of the terrorists ' 'rights . ' the terrorist 's victim are at risks unintentionally not having asked to be endangered . but the terrorists knowingly initiated his actions . unlike his victim he volunteered for the risk of his deed . by threatening to kill for profit or idealism he renounces civilized standards and he can have no complaint if civilization tries to thwart him by whatever means necessary . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> terrorist relinquish most of their way to protection under the law <eos>
