<s> equality : do law unions offering sufficient equality to gays ? <eos>

<s> the idea that opening civil unions to straights solves the problems of civil unions be `` separate but unequal '' fail a very simple test . while heterosexuals may have equal accessing to civil unions do gays have equal accessing to marriage ? no . clearly therefore allowing straights to participate in civil unions while continued to deny gays the right to marry does not nullify the arguments that civil unions are akin to `` separate but equal '' and actually unequal . <eos>

@highlight

<s> civil unions still `` separate but equal '' if straights can do it . <eos>
