<s> editor-experience : is wiki good/fun/healthy for its editors ? <eos>

<s> on wikipedia there are no required topics and no one is setting assignments . that means that anyone can find part of the encyclopedia they 're consider in and add to it immediately ( if they can do better than what 's been there ) . this increases motivation and keeping thing fun . <eos>

@highlight

<s> users edit according to their interests and desires on wikipedia . <eos>
