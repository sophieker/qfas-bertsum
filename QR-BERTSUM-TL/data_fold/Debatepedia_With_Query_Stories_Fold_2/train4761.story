[ citation needed ] this is because newly developed technology such as bio ccs algal synthesis value captured pre-smokestack co # ( such as from a coal fired power station for example ) as a useful feedstock input to the production of oil-rich algal in solar membranes to produce oil for plastics and transport fuel ( including aviation fuel ) and wholesome stockfeed for farm animal production . the co # and other captured greenhouse gases are injected into the membranes contain waste water and select strains of algal causing together with sun or uv lights <eos>
