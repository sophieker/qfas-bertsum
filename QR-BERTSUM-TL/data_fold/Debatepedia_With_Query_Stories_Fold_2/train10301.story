<s> what does the scripture saying on the subject ? <eos>

<s> the bible said that gods created everything ideal but darwin 's theories maintains that the first organisms were the simplest ones and therefore clearly imperfect . also the bible said that died began at the falling but evolutionists say that survival of the fittest ( which involves died of the unfit and imperfect ) has been going on since well before mankind arrived on the scene and therefore before the fall . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the scriptural account of creation flies firmly in the faces of macroevolutionism . <eos>
