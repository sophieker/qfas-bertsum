<s> `` why official english ? '' : `` official english does n't mean 'english only . ' none of the # states with official english laws prohibit government agencies from using another languages when there is a compelling public interest for doing so . these include : protecting public health and safety assuring equality before the law promoting tourism teaching foreign languages providing for national defense and many other legitimate common sense needs . '' the government can act to provide these services when necessary . but it is another thing entirely for a citizen to demand these services as a right . <eos>
