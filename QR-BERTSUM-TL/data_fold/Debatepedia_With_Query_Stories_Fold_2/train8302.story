<s> should hating speech be censored for the good of society ? <eos>

<s> politics will use such law to stabilize there position in the country . for example : elizabeth mosquitoes used simular laws to prove her authoritet in her country . it was abstained demonstrations against she . as a result - # students were arested and came into prison for using hate sp : eech . so why we need law which is not working which is used against people . and finally contradicts wdhr . artical # says that each person have right for freedom of speech expression . why do we need such law ? there is no answer . moreover politics can express there opinion and idea in different way . for example meer judea in israeli ( he is a chairman in congress ) exprest his idea by h.s . but then law - <eos>

@highlight

<s> law against hate speech can be used in the political sphere . <eos>
