<s> vs. `` non-treatment '' : is abortion better than withdrawing life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> doctors are allowed to make non-treatment decisions in special cases in order to shorten the life of a patient and end their suffering . this is a roundabout form of `` euthanasia '' that causes patients far more harm than a real euthanasia would . doctors should be allowed to use euthanasia to avoid having to make these non-treatment decisions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> euthanasia is better than non-treatment way to shorten lives and ends suffering <eos>
