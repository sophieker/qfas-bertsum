<s> growing government : does us stimulus right/wrongly grow government ? <eos>

<s> the spending in the stimulus will go toward many government programs growing them so that they become a constant burden on tax payers and constraint for free markets . none of this is desirable and this is why tax cuts are a better alternative ; it provides stimulus without growing government and in fact shrinking government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> stimulus will be used to grow govt bureaucracy <eos>
