<s> environment : would banning plastic bag be great for the environment ? <eos>

<s> plastic shopping bags take thousands of years to break down and thus they are detrimental for the environment and deadly for the sea life . every year billions of plastic bags are used and thrown away . plastic bags are not making from a renewables source and we are wasting tons of resources every year with plastic bags . a lot of plastic is used to make the billions of plastic every year and normally is n't recycled . using plastic bags as bin liners is not really recycling because you throw them away once they are filled with rubbish . every year australia alone uses over # billion plastic bags and over # million end up clogging up the streets drains and parks .
