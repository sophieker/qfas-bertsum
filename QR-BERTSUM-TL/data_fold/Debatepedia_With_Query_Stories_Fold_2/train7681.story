<s> tolerance : should people tolerate hunters and their beliefs ? <eos>

<s> some people believe killing is never justified . some people believe that it can be justified . neither group is necessarily `` right '' . neither group is likely to ever change their positions . these are legitimate differences of opinion that must be respected and no laws should be created that are intolerant of these differences . <eos>

@highlight

<s> differences of opinion on killing and hunting must be tolerated <eos>
