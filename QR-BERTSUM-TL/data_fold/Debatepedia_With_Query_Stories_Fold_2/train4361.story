<s> feasibility : is complete denuclearization feasible ? <eos>

<s> in a non-nuclear world a state that build even a single nuclear weapons achieves an enormous leap in geopolitical strength . the second dozens or so nuclear weapons would carry a substantial amounts of geopolitical power in the international system . thus the incentive to build these second nuclear weapons would be very high and hard to resist especially for rogue or traditionally less powerful countries . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it 's not possibility to stopping nuclear weapons now <eos>
