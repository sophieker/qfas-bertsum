<s> self-defense : would a hand-gun ban leave sufficient means of self defense ? <eos>

<s> the majority of violent encounters occur on the street versus in the home . hand guns are a particularly important means to protecting one self on the street . this is primarily the case because handguns can be easily carried by law-abiding civilians and concealed so as to avoid scaring other citizens . shotguns and rifles do not share these characteristics . <eos>
