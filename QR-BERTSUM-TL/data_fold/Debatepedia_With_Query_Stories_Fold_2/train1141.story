<s> importance : is internet access fundamental in modernity ? <eos>

<s> ed morrissey . `` the internet the bbc and 'rights ' '' hot air . march # th # : `` the right to speak springs from the innate sense of owning one s self rather than being a property of the state which means that each individual has the right to their own thoughts and to express them . that right doesn t extend to publication however which is where toure s argument runs off the rails . if one wants to get published then either one has to own the means to publication or pay someone else for the service . after all no one has the right to confiscate someone else s printing press in order to get published . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> no right to means of expression like internet <eos>
