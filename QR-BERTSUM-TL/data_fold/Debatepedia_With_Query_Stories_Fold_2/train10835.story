<s> global warming : can hydropower help cuts emission fight global warming ? <eos>

<s> the world energy council hydropower data shows that hydropower is presently generating about # # twh ( terrawatt hours or millions of megawatt hours annually ) . if we include both high head ( hydropower dams ) and low head ( run-of-the-river micro plants ) system using current technologies the world can probably economically generate almost # # twh annually . [ # ] this means that hydropower could move from its current position of supply roughly # % of all electricity demand worldwide to supplying upwards of # % . some argue that `` we have enough economically usable river water resources to generate virtually # % of current global wiring demand . '' [ # ] this is a very important conclusion as it means that hydropower is a viable long-term # -emissions alternative to coal the biggest <eos>

@highlight

<s> hydropower is capable of scaling to fully replacing coal . <eos>
