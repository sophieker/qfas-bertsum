<s> social value - do video games have a negative impact on the social engagement of gamers ? <eos>

<s> a child may be antisocial simply as a matter of their own behavior and disposition . this may be inborn or it could be a result of poor parental engagement in ensuring that a child has sufficient social opportunities . therefore - on the causal relationship - a child may choose to play a video game alone because they are already anti-social instead of them becoming anti-social because they are playing video games alone . in addition the opportunity to make video-gaming social as described above may mean that gamers that play isolating games are making such a choice due to pre-existing anti-social behavior . <eos>

@highlight

<s> anti-social behavior may not be a causal result of video games : <eos>
