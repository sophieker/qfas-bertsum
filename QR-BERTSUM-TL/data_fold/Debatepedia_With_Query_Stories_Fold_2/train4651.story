<s> science : are there good scientific reasons for colonizing the moon ? <eos>

<s> `` do n't colonize the moon . '' la times . december # # : `` manned moon flight may appeal to babies baby-boomer but it makes little scientific sense for most space missions these days . robots can now perform or be developed to perform most of the tasks people would do at a moon station . and even if the world shares the goal of landing astronauts on nov this is a roundabout way to achieve it . why re-create the older technologies for going to the moon when they are of no use to get to mars ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> unmanned mission to moon less cost-efficient than robotic mission <eos>
