<s> alternatives : are the alternatives to the caucuses inadequate ? <eos>

<s> by allowing less populated states to start to vote and having the most populated to go last the alternatives promotes better democratic participate as the winner of the party nomination can not be yet established until all states have voted . the states that are last to vote but maintain their influence by the high number of delegate they can offer . this insures that the public maintains interest and participates more to the democratic processes <eos>

@highlight

<s> frontloading of the primary schedule can help reduce the special interest effect contained in all huge money campaigns . <eos>
