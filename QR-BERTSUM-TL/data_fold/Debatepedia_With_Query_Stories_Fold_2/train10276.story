<s> rape : would the legalization of prostitution decrease instances rape ? <eos>

<s> prostitution is a form of rape . it is an environment in which women are effectively forced by a man to have sex with them merely through the fact that they are willing to pay . and this relationship is frequently established between a `` pimp '' or the brother and customer instead of between the customer and the prostitute undermining the notion of the contract being established between consenting adults . if the women is not truly consenting prostitution takes on a form of a paying man forcing a woman to have sex with him which can be viewed as a form of rape . this is not something the state should sanction . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legalization wo n't reduce rape as prostitution is itself a form of rape <eos>
