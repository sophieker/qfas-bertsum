<s> economics : is algae biofuel financially viable ? <eos>

<s> biofuels that are created from land-plants all have specific soil-quality requirements . if soil in an area does not meet the specific nutrients requirements of a biofuel plant-type that plants can not be constructed and used to producing the biofuel in the land-area . algae because it grows in water ( of almost any kind and quality ) is not restricted by soil-quality . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there are no soil requirement for algal biofuel . <eos>
