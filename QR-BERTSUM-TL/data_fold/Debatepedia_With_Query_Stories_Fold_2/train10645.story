<s> economy : is balanced budget amendment good for economy ? <eos>

<s> kathy white . `` guest commentary : a federal balanced budget amendment would hurt the economy . '' denver post . july # th # : `` some of the balanced budget amendment proposals do n't just ban the federal government from ever spending more than it takes in . most also require that if taxes ever are raised it would take a two-thirds vote of congress rather than a majority . and they cap total spending at some arbitrary level even if revenues exceed that amount . it 's government by formula . it ignores emerging needs or crises that can arise at any time . it would ratchet down spending to levels not seen in # years even though our needs have grown tremendously since then . '' <eos>
