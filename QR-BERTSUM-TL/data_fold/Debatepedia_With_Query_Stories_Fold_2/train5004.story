<s> energy : can wave power supply significant quantities of energy ? <eos>

<s> `` pros and cons of ocean wave energy '' . energy consumer 's edge - `` wave energy is intermittent and variable . even in the most active wave areas there are many days with little wave activity . on days that have good wave activity wave levels can vary . as explained on the pros and cons of wind power page resolving intermittency problems to attain reliable energy output can double and even triple the cost of power . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> wave power is too inconsistent <eos>
