<s> bad apples : should abuse of enhanced interrogation be attributed to bad apples ? <eos>

<s> even without any bad apples and with interrogators following the script on `` enhanced interrogations '' the techniques still amount to torture . it is not an issue of `` bad apples '' but a specific program that inherently involves torture . <eos>

@highlight

<s> enhanced interrogations are torture ; not issue of `` bad apples '' <eos>
