<s> cultures/sexism : is it sound culturally to allow for gender selection ? <eos>

<s> women are already seen in the majority of cultures as less valuable than men . sex selection is not supported by the universal declaration of human rights ; its writers did not imagine recent developments but did include rights for equal treatment and status for women which allowing gender selection would undermine . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sexual selection will re-enforce gender discrimination <eos>
