<s> clone : is cloned reasonable to cloned humans ? <eos>

<s> statement of the catholic leaders conference on human cloning . the catholic leaders conference . november # # - `` in the case of reproductive cloning the engendered child would be brought to term and delivered without the benefits of children since it would carry the genetic code only of the one who had supplied the dna from his or her somatic cell . this would also constitute a violation of the rights of the child in many ways . since there is currently no basis in common or statutory law to determine who would have responsibility for the care of the child it would be right in a precarious position . '' <eos>
