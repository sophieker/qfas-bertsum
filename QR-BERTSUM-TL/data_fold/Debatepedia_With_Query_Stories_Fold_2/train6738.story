<s> tradition : should promotion of the traditional reactors family be avoided ? <eos>

<s> just as married couples receive tax benefits and childless mothers be suffering cuts in entitlements law prohibition of adoption by gays is a natural step toward this ideal . the traditional nuclear families is still an ideal that should be clung to and which deserves the protection and motivation of the state . evolution and nature has shown that the natural developing of the young is aided by both these influences . <eos>

@highlight

<s> opposing gays adoption preserves traditional family as ideal for child-rearing . <eos>
