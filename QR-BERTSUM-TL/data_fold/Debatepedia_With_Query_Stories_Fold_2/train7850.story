<s> iran 's leadership holds radical muslim views that making it more likely than other countries to roll-out the risk of use a nuclear weapon . this radical ideology discounts the faculty of reason making it difficult to count on iran making a sound cost-benefit analysis that use a nuclear weapon is not in their interest and would likely lead to their annihilation . in this way the risks that the iranian regime will use its nuclear weapons against another country are intolerably high . <eos>
