<s> accountability : will elections making judge more or less accountable ? <eos>

<s> legal decision requiring a strict interpretation of law . it should not be driven by popular opinion . yet this is precisely what judicial elections call for . this diverges from basic judicial principles of applying the law objectively and neutrally . <eos>

@highlight

<s> re-elected judge wrongly interpreting public opinion over the law <eos>
