<s> climate change : are oil sands bad for climate change ? <eos>

<s> james podesta head of center for american progress . june # speech on oil sands : `` let me make a note on what the co # goal here seems to be in light of this morning s discussions . if developed countries want to reduce co # emissions by # percent by # setting a goal of lowering oil sands emissions to come into line with conventional oil production is the wrong goal . the arrow is pointing in the wrong direction . oil sands can t simply be as good as conventional oil . we want to reduce fossil fuel use and accelerating the transition to cleaner technologies in the transportation sector and elsewhere . '' <eos>

<s> making oil sands `` as cleaned as petroleum '' is insufficient <eos>
