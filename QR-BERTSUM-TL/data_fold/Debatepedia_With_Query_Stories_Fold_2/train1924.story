<s> tax-revenue : could tax-revenue from a `` fat tax '' be used for positive purposes ? <eos>

<s> different food industry lobbies oppose such taxes and exercise pressures on governments . many food-related multi-national companies are big supporters of presidential campaigns in the usa and also have very importance lobbies in various other countries . cash gained from such a taxes would also actually be channelled into armament programs and other big-budget services instead of directly to consumers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> governments have no incentive to impose additional tax on fatty food . <eos>
