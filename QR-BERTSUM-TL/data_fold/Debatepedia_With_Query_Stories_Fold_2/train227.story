<s> protecting women : is burqa abusive or does it help protect women ? <eos>

<s> ghada al atrash janbey . `` on quebec s decision to ban the muslim niqab . '' dissident voice . april # th # : `` i would also like to make clear that i am not implying one needs to shed his/her identity in another country . in fact when not taken to extreme measures ( as is the case with the niqab ) the hijab covering the hair can make a positive statement about celebrating religious beliefs or cultural traditions as is the case with an indian wearing her flamboyant silk sari or a pakistani wearing her traditional salwar kameez . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> hijab is modest non-identity-concealing alternative to burqa <eos>
