<s> economics : is multiculturalism better than assimilation economically ? <eos>

<s> one primary problem for indigenous peoples is that they lack the basic mainstream skills required to succeed in the societies in which they live . assimilation helps them achieve these basic language cultural etiquette and working-environment skills that enable them to compete in the working environment and succeed . multiculturalism conversely would allow indigenous groups to exist in isolation where they would not acquire these skills and where the would be incapable of progressing socio-economically . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assimilation can provide indigenous peoples with skills to succeed <eos>
