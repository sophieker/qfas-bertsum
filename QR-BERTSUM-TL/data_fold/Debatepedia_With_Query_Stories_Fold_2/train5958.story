<s> products : do ads to children foster a `` must-have '' mentality ? <eos>

<s> advertising intended to children is dishonest because they have bit or no cash of their own and have to persuade their parents to buy the product for them . perhaps than advertising directly to parents companies use a `` nag and whine '' campaign that leads to bad feeling between parents and children . they rely on pester power to make adults spend cash they don t have on things they don t want to buy and which their children may well only play with for a few hours . <eos>

@highlight

<s> advertisements cause children to begging for products ; harms child-parent relations . <eos>
