<s> globally integration : is globalization and the integration of economies a good thing ? <eos>

<s> globalisation means that economies are becoming more not less interdependent . therefore now more than ever it is impractical as well as undesirable to introducing trade barriers . other countries will be offended at this snub and will respond economically or diplomatically by further isolating the country concerned . there is which a clear link between economy openness and good government because the global investment markets demand high standards of accountability budgetary competence and political responsibility from governments . because citizen which benefit from cleaner government and better policies they which have an interest in an open economy .

@highlight

<s> trading and openness is in the interest of countries . <eos>
