<s> limited government <eos>

<s> while it may be true that in a democracy government is of by for the people it should also be recognized that the bigger the government gets and the more employees it has the more taxpayer money it expends . while it may be trying to do `` the will of the people '' it inadvertently burdens and harms the people in the process . <eos>

@highlight

<s> govt of by for the people is still a burden on people . <eos>
