<s> designer babies : can gender choices avoid a slippery slope to designer babies ? <eos>

<s> individuals do not procreate randomly : they choose their partners and often choose the time of conceive according to their own age and prosperity . parents give so much to children . they invest years of their lives and a large amount of their earnings in their upbringing . isn t it fair that in return they getting to decide something like this if they need to ? this is an extension of fertility rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` designer baby '' fears are exaggerated ; all baby are to some regard designed . <eos>
