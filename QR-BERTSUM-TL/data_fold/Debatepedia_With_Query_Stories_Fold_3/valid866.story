<s> ticking time bomb : might torture be justified in the famous ticking time-bomb scenario ? <eos>

<s> - it is not necessary that there be a high probability that the `` ticking time bomb '' scenario will occur . what is important is that it is not implausible to imagine that it could occur . if it were to occur leaders must be in a position of flexibility to use torture to to save a million lives . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a one-in-a-million probability of the `` ticking time bomb '' occurring is sufficient to justify allowing torture in this scenario <eos>
