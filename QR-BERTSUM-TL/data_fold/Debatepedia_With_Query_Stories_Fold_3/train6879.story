<s> fundamentalism : is islamic extremism rising around the world ? <eos>

<s> the terrorist branches of such groups ( such as al-qaeda ) and the too talked of jihad ( holy war ) are totally antithetical to democratic values . islamic terrorism is different from that of terrorists who fight for nationalist causes : islamic terrorism is motivated by religious zeal perhaps than a will for political change and as such can not be seen as a product of a failing political system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> islamic fundamentalist groups are growing in popularity in part as a reaction to the extension of westernization via globalisation . <eos>
