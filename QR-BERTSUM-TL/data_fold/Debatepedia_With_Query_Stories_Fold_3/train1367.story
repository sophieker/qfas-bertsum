<s> presidential nominees : is filibustering presidential nominees ever appropriate ? <eos>

<s> william kristol . `` break the filibuster '' . the weekly standard . may 9th 2005 : `` there is no rationale for a filibuster however when the senate is acting under article 2 in advising and consenting to presidential nominations . as crockett points out here the president is 'the originator and prime mover . if he wants to make the process more burdensome perhaps through lengthy interviews or extraordinary background checks he can . ' the senate 's role is to accept or reject the president 's nominees just as the president has a responsibility to accept or reject a bill approved by both houses of congress . there he does not have the option of delay . nor should congress have the option of delay in what is fundamentally an executive <eos>
