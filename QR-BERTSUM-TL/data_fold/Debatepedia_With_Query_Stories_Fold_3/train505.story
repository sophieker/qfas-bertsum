<s> `` net neutrality will increase government monitor of internet traffic . '' hands off the internet on opposing views : `` net neutrality calls for the federal government to enforcing standards on how online data is transmitted . but to accomplish this there would have to be a significant increase in federal monitor of online traffic at all levels to ensure requirements include both the public internet and dedicated public networks . moreover once inevitable disputes arose federal courts would become involved which would likely lead to even higher levels of monitoring . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> net impartiality means higher regulatory of the internet <eos>
