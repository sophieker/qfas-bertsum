<s> does the gnu project deserve credit for the success of this operate system ? <eos>

<s> it was ever affiliated with gnu and is it 's own operating system . the linux system utilizes repair of the gnu toolbox which is not an operating system and does not deserve the loan that it is try to give to either . <eos>

@highlight

<s> linux is not part of the gpl project . <eos>
