<s> reducing emissions : can market approaches better reducing emission ? <eos>

<s> with cafe standards in the united states for example substantial fines were established for car manufacturers that produced inefficient cars . in # car had to be able to travel # . # miles per gallon ( mpg ) and light trucks had to be able to drive # . # . companies were fined $ # for each # . # mpg over fleet-limit for each car sold . so if a company purchased # million car that averaged # . # mpg over the standards it would be fined $ # million . [ # ] obviously this created a good cost-based incentive for car-manufacturers to produce more efficiency car that emit less carbon gases . so standards set costs and create incentives for change just like so-called `` market-mechanisms '' . <eos>

<s> command-and-control regulations do create costs that incentivizing reduction in carbon emissions : <eos>
