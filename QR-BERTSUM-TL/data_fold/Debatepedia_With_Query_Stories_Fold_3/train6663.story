<s> independence : is a republics important to australian independence from britain ? <eos>

<s> the first european settlers in australia were from england arriving in the # s between the american and french revolutionary wars . for nearly # year australia was considered a british colony and was completely dependent on england for money and resources . in # australia became independent but decided to remains a part of the commonwealth where it continued to receive aid from britain . it remains part of the british commonwealth with full independence except for authority of the queen and her appointed governor-general . given the fact that australia would not exist without the initial decision of the crown to colonize australia it seems entirely appropriate that a token of allegiance remains to the crown within the commonwealth system . to deny this <eos>

@highlight

<s> australia was founded by the crown and so owes began loyalties in the commonwealth . <eos>
