<s> performance : do hybrid vehicle performing well ? <eos>

<s> hybrid may have good `` power '' and performance . yet this should not be seen as a significant advantages over such alternatives as electric and hydrogen vehicles ( and it 's debatable whether hybrid actually have superior performance to the main alternatives ) . if for the sake of argument we were to allow that hybrid have superior performance the question is whether we should give this argument any weight ? no . the morality priority at this time is to combat global warming not uphold the showy unecessary and even more inefficient power/performance of hybrid/gasoline vehicles . fight global warming not performance is the clear morality priority in modern times . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` power '' of hybrids is thoughtless in the face of global warming . <eos>
