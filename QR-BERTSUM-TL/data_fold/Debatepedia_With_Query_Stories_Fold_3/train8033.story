<s> we hunt and eating animals ... is testing justified by our already hunt and eating animals ? <eos>

<s> it is not a justification for animal testing that some humans eat and hunt animals . a tenant of the animal rights community is that any form of harms to animals is mistake usually if it can be easily avoided with reasonable substitutes . it is therefore also not appropriate to say that `` the eating and hunting of animals goes without much public outcry so why alienate animal testing ? '' the truth is that the eating and hunting of animals is met by substantial protest by animal rights activists . again hunting and beef consumption do not provide cover for animal testing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> eating and hunting of animals does not justifying testing ; equally wrong <eos>
