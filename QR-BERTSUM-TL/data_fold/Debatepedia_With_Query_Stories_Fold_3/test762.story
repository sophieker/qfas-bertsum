<s> do citizens feeling good about armed police ? <eos>

<s> discharging weapons into the flight to disperse rioters is easier and more efficiency than stunning all of them . things like teargas and knockout gas can be used to instantly halted a groups of rioters or make them leave . if things get violent with the rioters and peoples lives are in danger that is when the time for rubber bullets and tasers has passed and deadly force is needed to protect the lives of the innocent . any sort of police force should be prepared to do these things in the event of a riot to protect those temporarily instead of temporarily . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arming cops and swat teams can quelled riots . <eos>
