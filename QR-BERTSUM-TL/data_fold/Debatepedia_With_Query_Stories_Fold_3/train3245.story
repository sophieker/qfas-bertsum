<s> science : does a manned mission to mars have scientific value ? <eos>

<s> jazz shaw . `` robots should go where man hesitates . '' pajamas media . july 20 2009 : `` robotic exploration delivers countless advantages . it is true that there will always be situations where a live human being will be able to adapt and think through situations which would leave a machine crippled in the dust . but have we done so badly with the robots currently in service ? two rovers on mars are still trundling along dragging disabled wheels and running on low power due to dust covered solar panels but performing their mission years beyond initial projections . also unmanned missions are free of the burden of delivering air food water and all of the other requirements for keeping humans alive . they weigh less cost <eos>

@highlight

<s> robotic missions to mars are equally effective as manned ones <eos>
