<s> evolutionary defy creature <eos>

<s> evolutionists theorise that some reptiles evolved into mammals whilst others became birds . the platypus has somehow got trait similar to all three types of creature but how how on earth can this be evolutionarily explained ? by the time the supposed missing links between reptiles and birds and reptiles and mammals had developed the trait found in the platypus ' genome the two species would actually be able to reproduce with one another and could by no means therefore producing a creature capable of evolving into a platypus . the only rational explanation for the striking similarities the platypus being a mammal has with a duck is that both creatures were separately designed by the same god . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the duck- billed platypus is an excellent instance of a living creature which totally undermine darwinism . <eos>
