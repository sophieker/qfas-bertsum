<s> iran : would withdrawals benefit the united states ' ability to deal with iran ? <eos>

<s> it is important to note that iraqi shiite are arab while iranian shiite are persian . this places significant limitation on iran 's capacity to exert influence over the southern region of iraq and generally should reduce concerns that a us withdrawal from iraq will result in iranian taking control over iraq or at than the shiite south . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iranian influence in iraq is limited because iraqi sunnis are arab not persian . <eos>
