<s> global warming : can iron fertilization help significantly fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> while ocean science does traditionally defining `` sequestration '' in terms of sea floor sediment that is isolated from the atmosphere for millions of years modern climate scientists and kyoto protocol policy makers however defining sequestration in much shorter time frames . they recognize trees and even grasslands for instance as important carbon sinks . forest biomass only sequesters carbon for decade but carbon that sinks below the marine thermocline ( # ~ # meters ) is effectively removed from the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years whether it is remineralized or not . since deep ocean currents take so long to resurface their carbon content is effectively `` sequestered '' by any terrestrial criterion in use today . <eos>
