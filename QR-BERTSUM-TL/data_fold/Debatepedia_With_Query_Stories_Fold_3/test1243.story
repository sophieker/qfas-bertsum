<s> peter cohan . `` why obama 's $ # billion bank tax is fair game . '' daily finance . january # # : `` the banks of course say 'no fair . ' but i disagree . despite writhing in front of congress week wall street is the primary culprit for the financial crisis and should pick up these losses -- especially aig 's . that 's because many wall street banks got a back door bail-out through aig when the government made good on the credit default swap payments aig owed the banks but could n't pay on . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> citigroup bailout benefited banks ; banks tax justified <eos>
