<s> economics : are education voucher economical efficient ? <eos>

<s> under a student voucher system where demands exists for education from the parents that would rather attend a different school entrepreneurial are free to open and invest in new schools to accommodate demand . supply demands in this sense is typically a good thing in its own right . people that want something are wiser if someone is allowed to fulfill their desires . but this is only possible under a student voucher system where students can move freely between schools and schools are free to accommodate this fluids demand . <eos>

@highlight

<s> market-driven education vouchers help supply demand . <eos>
