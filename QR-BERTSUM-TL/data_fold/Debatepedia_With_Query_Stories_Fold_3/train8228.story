<s> harm : should extremist groups be banning that `` harm '' other groups ? how can this be defined ? <eos>

<s> although legislators in extremist parties be promote intolerance and discriminatory policies very rarely do they directly call for violent action so what impact are we seeking to restrain ? we already have law that regulate the conduct of free speech - slander libel etc . yet the basic premise of free speech in a democracy must be protected at all cost or else we risk turning into the kind of society that these extremist group support . again this is unless a clearly physical harm can be demonstrated .

@highlight

<s> as long as extremist party do promote physical harm to others they should be given freedom to engaging in politics . <eos>
