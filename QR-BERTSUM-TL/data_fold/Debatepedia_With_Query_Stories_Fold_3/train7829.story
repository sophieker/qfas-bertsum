<s> courts : have the courts ruled that the second amendment confers an individual right ? <eos>

<s> cases such as us vs. miller that were brought to the supreme court have contributed to making significant differences of the context in which the second amendment can be applied . in us vs. miller the court established that the second amendment `` did not guarantee a citizen 's right to possess a sawed-off shotgun '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> previous supreme court decisions ruled that the second amendment does not apply to personal guns <eos>
