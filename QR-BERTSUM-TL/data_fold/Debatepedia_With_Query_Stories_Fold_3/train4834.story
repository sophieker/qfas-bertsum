<s> democratic process : do earmarks strengthen the democratic process ? <eos>

<s> david minge former member of the u.s. house of representatives . `` the case against academic earmarking '' - `` within the academic community the earmarking process could become corrosive . at its logical extreme faculty would be rewarded more for their role in politics than for developing sound research proposals . assistant professors would be encouraged to put up lawn signs and distribute campaign literature to enhance their political influence with members of congress . given the importance of fundraising department heads deans and university presidents would be drawn into raising money for congressional races as a way of gaining the ultimate influence . we certainly do not want to go down that road . '' <eos>

<s> earmarks award funding based on politics not on merit <eos>
