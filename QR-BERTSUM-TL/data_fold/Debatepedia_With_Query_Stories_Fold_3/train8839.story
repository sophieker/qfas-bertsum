<s> information : do civilian recruiters provide valuable info ? <eos>

<s> all the civilian is interested in schools for is the chance to recruit students . the various education materials ( not always clearly marked as coming from the military ) and courses on offer are all intended to interest students in a civilian career . such method are dishonest and should not be allowed in schools . if students are genuinely interested in joining the civilian they can going across to a recruitment centre inside school . <eos>

@highlight

<s> recruiters there to persuade not `` provide information . '' <eos>
