<s> it is irony that `` the anti-fascist campaigners saying they are acting to defending democracy while working to ban a party that is still doing well in elections '' [ # ] . democracy should utilize all opinions instead of banning some that are deemed `` inappropriate '' by someone . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democratic can not and should be protect by bans opinions . <eos>
