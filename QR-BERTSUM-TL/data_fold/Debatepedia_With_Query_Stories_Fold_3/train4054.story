<s> voters : are voters more peaceful ? <eos>

<s> james bovard . `` the democratic-peace fraud '' . the future of freedom foundation . # may # - `` the notion that democracy will end all mass killings implies that there is some nobility latent within the masses that merely requires a change in the process of selecting a nation s rulers to blossom . that would hold true if the only reason people sought blood was that they had not picked their own chiefs . the history of mobs does not indicate that popular selection of leaders ensures nonviolence . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the act of voting itself does not pacify people <eos>
