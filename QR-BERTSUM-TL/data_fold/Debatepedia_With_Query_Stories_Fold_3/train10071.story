<s> economics : are co-ops economical ? can they keep costs down ? <eos>

<s> rick moran . `` health insurance co-ops too much like the public option '' . american issues project . august 18 2009 : `` as a concept health insurance co-ops are attractive because ostensibly they would be run by the consumer for the benefit of the consumer and with no profit motive premiums theoretically should be cheaper . but in practice we are liable to get a much different animal with the same kind of inefficiency and administrative waste we see in government run health insurance entities like medicare or medicaid . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> co-ops are equally inefficient as public insurance <eos>
