<s> learning : does it lead to improved learning in its widest sense ? <eos>

<s> the focus on standardized test ( all students in a state take the same test under the same conditions ) as the means of assessment encourages teachers to teach a narrower subgroup of skill that will increase test performance rather than focus on deeper understanding and life lessons that can be applied in the marketplace real life and to citizenship and democracy generally . because teachers and schools be be punished if they fail to live up to standardized test score goals they sometimes have a perverse incentive to focus almost entirely on teaching to the test especially where a school is at risk of being designated as `` failing '' . <eos>

<s> no child left behind inspires unfortunate `` teaching to the test '' : <eos>
