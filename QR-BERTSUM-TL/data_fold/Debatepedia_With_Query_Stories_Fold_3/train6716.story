<s> improving justice : would a dna database help improve the accuracy of the criminal justice system ? <eos>

<s> environmental factors at the crime scene such as heat sunlight or bacteria can corrupt any genetic data . any dna evidence must be stored in sterile and temperature controlled conditions . criminals have been suspected of contaminating samples by swapping saliva.there is room for human error or fraud in comparing samples taken from suspects with those removed from a crime scene . the accuracy of any genetic profile is dependent upon the number of genes examined . where less than four or five genes can be investigated the pcr technique serves only to exaggerate any defects or omissions in the sample . in # an # month investigation was launched into allegations that the fbi crime lab was drylabbing or faking results of dna comparisons.even <eos>

@highlight

<s> although dna detection might have advantages over fingerprint dusting the test is nevertheless fallible . <eos>
