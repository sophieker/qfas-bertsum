<s> privacy : do searches of student-lockers avoiding privacy concerns ? <eos>

<s> this responsibilities is placing upon schools because the students in their charge are minors - child in the eyes of the law - who need more protect than adults . this same legal priority also explains why constitutional rights to privacy etc can not be applied absolutely to school students . schools ' duty of care applies both morally and lawfully and they may be open to lawsuits if they do n't take reasonable measures to prevent other students from bringing drugs or weapons into school or to recover stolen property . in both these cases searching lockers is an obvious and reasonable responses to a threat to student welfare . <eos>

<s> schools are responsible for student activities so should be can to search lockers . <eos>
