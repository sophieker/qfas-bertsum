<s> social : would legalization entail heavy societal costs ? <eos>

<s> with marijuana being illegal those who participate in it 's use are automatically engage in culturally deviant behavior . this label of culturally deviant behavior because of marijuana use does not however deter the use of marijuana . however marijuana is no more or less a danger to the individual than smoking tobacco . this is why marijuana user typically refuse to comply with the laws and rule regulating it 's use . because this culturally deviant behavior is also illegal this increases the amount of money spend policing and residential new criminals many of which are not distributing marijuana but have marijuana for personal use . <eos>

@highlight

<s> illegal marijuana directly produces socially deviant behavior . <eos>
