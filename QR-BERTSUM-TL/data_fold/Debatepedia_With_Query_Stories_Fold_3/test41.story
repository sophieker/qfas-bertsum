<s> `` encyclopedia '' : is wikipedia an `` encyclopedia '' or is this too strong a word ? <eos>

<s> robert mchenry said that wikipedia errs in billing itself as an encyclopedia because that word implies a level of authority and accountability that they believe can not be possessed by an openly editable reference . he said `` to the ordinary user the turmoil and uncertainty that may lurk beneath the surface of a wikipedia article are invisible . he or she arrives at a wikipedia article via google perhaps and sees that it is part of what claims to be an `` encyclopedia '' . this is a word that carries a powerful connotation of reliability . the typical user does n't know how conventional encyclopedias achieve reliability only that they do .
