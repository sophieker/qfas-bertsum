<s> vs. air travel : how does high-speed rail compare to air travel ? <eos>

<s> `` on the wrong track : why high-speed trains are not such a green alternative . '' guardian . april 29th 2010 : `` hsr is promoted as something that can sort out nasty carbon-producing aircraft on domestic routes . it has done this on the paris-lyon and madrid-seville lines but this ability to trash a single air route should not be interpreted as something than can dent the growth of air travel . germany has one of the largest hsr systems in the world yet has seen an explosion in internal air travel . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> high speed rail can not seriously displace air travel . <eos>
