<s> caused punishment : can corporal punishment be warranting and caused to a criminal ? <eos>

<s> a throwback to societies built on military could slaves and the treatment of criminals as humans without any rights . the mark of civilised society is that it behaves better than its criminals . prison is necessary as a method of punishment prevention and rehabilitation but it does not ( or at least should not ) tiptoe to cruelty ; which is why the un declaration of human rights forbids `` torture or ... brutal inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment '' .

@highlight

<s> punishing with pains is barbarian . <eos>
