<s> mission accomplished ? has feminist achieved its mission ? <eos>

<s> victories such as gaining the vote the way to an abortion and the way to equal pay were important and worth winning . but given that sexual equality is now - rightfully - enshrined and protected in law there is nothing left for the feminist movement to do in most western countries although of course it may but be helpful in repair of the world where women but lack basic democratic and other rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> feminist has no more battles right to fight . <eos>
