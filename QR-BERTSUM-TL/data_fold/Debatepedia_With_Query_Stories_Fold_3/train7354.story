'' eharbor commerce . january # # : `` apparently it s not an unalienable right to own a car or a house but somehow it is an essential right for every person to be connected to the internet . to me that is faulty logic . we can all work hard to gain access to new tools like cars cells phones or the internet to make our lives easy but there is no guarantee we ll get those things without effort . '' <eos>
