<s> is methanol attractive as a fuel ? <eos>

<s> - the volumetric energy density of methanol is around 18 mj/litre while e.g . for gasoline it is substantially higher - around 32 mj/litre . ethanol is also better than methanol in this respect - it contains more than 23 mj/litre . this makes methanol less attractive notably for automotive applications where lower volumetric energy density translates to lower mileage and necessitates a larger tank . <eos>

@highlight

<s> methanol has lower energy content than other fuels . <eos>
