<s> global warming : can steel fertilization help significantly combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> while ocean science does traditionally define `` sequestration '' in terms of sea floor sediment that is isolate from the atmosphere for millions of years modern climate scientists and kyoto protocol policy makers however define sequestration in much shorter time frames . they recognize tree and even grasslands for instance as important carbon sinks . forest biomass only sequesters carbon for decades but carbon that sinks below the marine thermocline ( # ~ # meters ) is effectively removed from the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years whether it is remineralized or not . since deep ocean currents take so short to resurface their carbon content is effectively `` sequestered '' by any terrestrial criterion in use today . <eos>

<s> algal need only sequester c # for roughly a century . <eos>
