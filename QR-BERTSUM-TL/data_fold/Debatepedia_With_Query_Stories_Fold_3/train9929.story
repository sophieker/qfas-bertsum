<s> global warming : can iron fertilization help significantly combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> `` a scientific critique of oceanic iron fertilization as a climate change mitigation strategy '' . greenpeace research laboratories . september 2007 - `` there is a risk that iron fertilization could result in increased production of nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas far more powerful than carbon dioxide . it is of great concern that one modelling study predicted that any benefits of carbon sequestration by commercial iron fertilization could be outweighed by nitrous oxide production . in two mesoscale studies which tested for the production of nitrous oxide one found a small but significant increase in nitrous oxide while the other did not detect the gas .
