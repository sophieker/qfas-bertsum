<s> recovery : would expiring the bush tax cut dampen the recovery ? <eos>

<s> revenue coming from higher taxes on the rich can be reinvested into the economy to stimulate growth rather of just sitting in the bank account of the wealthy . now it is true that some affluent will directly invest this money . but certainly not all do so . taxing and reinvested that cash assures that it re-circulates around the economy . <eos>
