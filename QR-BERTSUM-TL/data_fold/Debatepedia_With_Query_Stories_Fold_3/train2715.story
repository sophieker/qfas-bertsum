<s> economics : would private owners of water be more economical than a global commons ? <eos>

<s> . it is often unpolitical for elected authorities to make tough bold sacrificial or riskier moves in regard to water . while the water infrastructure for a city for example be desperately need repair an elected unofficial be be afraid for numerous reasons to raise taxes to supply the funds that can repair the city 's water infrastructure . as a result the elected unofficial does not raise the funds through taxes and avoids solving the problem . this is simply an illustration of instance in which public authorities take into account considerations that are not in the public interest and prevent proper funding of the water infrastructure . private investments in the water infrastructure are a very appropriate meaning to raise funds to solve <eos>

@highlight

<s> politics often prevent re-elected officials from adjusting prices and investing adequately in waters utilities <eos>
