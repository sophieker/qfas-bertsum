<s> william mckenzie . `` senate health bill should either be defeated or rewritten . '' dallas news . january # # : `` we consistently have warned about during this debate : the proposal still relies upon about half of its $ # billion financing through cuts in medicare . [ ... ] the real problem with these cuts is that they are very very unlikely to occur . over the last decade congress has shown a distinct unwillingness to make good on cuts to medicare . last month the house voted to walk on $ # billion in promised cuts . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> congress will not ultimately cut medicare to pay for reform <eos>
