<s> feasibility : is the colonization of the moon feasible ? <eos>

<s> the moon would has very extreme cold and heat depending on where the sun shines which presents many challenges to a lunar colony . the lack of a substantial atmosphere for insulation results in temperature extremes and makes the moon 's surface conditions somewhat like a deep space vacuum . it also leaves the lunar surface exposed to half as much radiation as in interplanetary space ( with the other half blocked by the moon itself underneath the colony ) . although lunar materials would potentially be useful as a simple radiation shield for living quarters shielding against solar flares during expeditions outside is more problematic . <eos>

@highlight

<s> temperature extremes make colonizing the moon very challenging . <eos>
