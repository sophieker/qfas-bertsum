<s> is warming changing a problem ? <eos>

<s> a team of mit scientists recorded a nearly simultaneous world-wide increase in methane levels skadden second increase in ten years . what baffles the team is that this data contradicts theories stating humans are the primary sources of increase in greenhouse gas . it takes about one full years for gases generated in the highly industrial northern hemisphere to cycle through and reach the southern hemisphere . last all worldwide levels rose simultaneously across the same years however it is probable that this may be part of a naturally cycle - and not the directly result of man 's contributions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the planet goes but climate cycles over time this is just another era . <eos>
