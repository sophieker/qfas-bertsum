<s> negative impact ? has the effect of feminism campaigns been negative in society ? <eos>

<s> there are numerous reasons why many more men than women choose certain professions one of which is that male-dominated professions can be unpleasant ones for women to work in regardless of their ability a problem which is likely to be self-perpetuating without intervention . men who resent losing out to women ( given the way employment law works they are likely to be equally well qualified rather than better-qualified women ) should reflects on the reason that women have been losing out to men for years . <eos>

@highlight

<s> campaigns on counsel of women in certain reflect the feminist contention that women have been unfairly discriminate against for years <eos>
