<s> social : are there broad social reasons for providing illegals with driver 's licenses ? <eos>

<s> the primary basis for this argument is that illegal immigrants are inherently in the united states illegally . on a purely legal basis they should not be afforded legal documentation such as a driver 's license and should be deported . beyond the legality many argue that the presence of illegal immigrants is harmful economically and socially to lawful citizens providing additional cause to moving away from integration and such measures as providing illegal immigrants with driver 's licenses . <eos>

@highlight

<s> illegal immigrants should not be integrated into american society but rather deported . <eos>
