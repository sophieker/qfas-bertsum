<s> society : does the burqa ban improve social strength ? <eos>

<s> michael white . `` france do n't ban the niqab . '' guardian . february 2010 : `` you need a much better reason than personal discomfort to do that in a free society . i do n't much care for facial piercings or tattoos either . `` so you want to make yourself ugly and unemployable do you ? '' i mutter to myself as i pass those who have them in the street . but we should n't ban them either . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> discomfort with burqa is inadequate justification for ban <eos>
