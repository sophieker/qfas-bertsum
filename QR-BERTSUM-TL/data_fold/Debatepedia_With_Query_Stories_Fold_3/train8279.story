<s> vs. `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia better than withdrawing life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> the `` natural death '' alternative to euthanasia is not keeping somebody alive via lives supporting until they dies on lives support . that would surely be unnatural . the natural alternative is rather to allow them to dies off of lives support . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the alternative to abortion is a natural died without life support . <eos>
