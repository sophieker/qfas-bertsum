<s> religion : is gay marriages acceptable on religious grounds ? <eos>

<s> ... the pagan religion wicca for example has `` hand-fasting '' which is equivalent to a wedding and which does not exclude homosexuals . there are other examples of religions that accept heterosexual marriage . therefore we need to looks at everyone and not just one religion . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many belief groups welcome gay marriage <eos>
