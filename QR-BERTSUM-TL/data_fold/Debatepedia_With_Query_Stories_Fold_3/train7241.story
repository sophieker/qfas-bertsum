<s> emissions : can hybrid vehicles significantly reducing emissions emissions ? <eos>

<s> hybrid car still rely on gasoline as their primary form of propulsion . they have an electric motor ( in addition to a gasoline engine ) but this can only drawing power in various ways from the gasoline engine . the hybrid only adds efficiency to the gasoline engine instead of replacing it entirely . the hybrid car remains therefore a major emitter of greenhouse gases and a contributer to global warming . while it may contributing less to global warming it still contributes significantly . if hybrids continue to be built in the coming decades they will continue to contributing substantial to global warming into the middle of the century . this is unacceptable . at a when when we must respond decisively to global warming investing in <eos>
