<s> investment in tgd and the costs of its construction were so large that it is unlikely to be closed in the future even if it become clear that the environmental and social costs were lower than expected . a return on investment must be achieved in such a project and this creates a the potential for a low levels of rigidity against social and environmental concerns . <eos>

@highlight

<s> opening tgd due to future problems is unlikely given its size <eos>
