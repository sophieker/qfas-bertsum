<s> history : were palestinians forcing out or fled on own will ? <eos>

<s> according to some sources palestinian flights from israeli was not obliged but was predominantly voluntary as a result of seven arab nations declaring war on israeli in # . those arab leaders encouraged and even ordered palestinians to evacuate the battle zone in ordering to make it easier for the arab armies and guerrillas to demolish the newly discovered jewish state and israeli officially denies any responsibilities for the palestinian exodus stating that their flights was caused by the arab invasion . karsh states that most palestinians chose their status as refugees themselves and therefore israeli is therefore absolved of responsibility . <eos>
