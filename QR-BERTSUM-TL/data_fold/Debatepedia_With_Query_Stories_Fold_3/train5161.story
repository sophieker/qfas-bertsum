<s> car insurance analogy : are mandates analogous to car insurance mandates ? <eos>

<s> the state issue driver license as a privileged . with that privilege comes responsibilities that are rightfully demanded by the state in a quid pro quo fashion such as the demand that the driver obtain auto insurance in order to protect other driver on the road . yet there is no such oil-dependencies quid pro quo arrangement in the case of health insurance mandates ; being dying is not a privilege like driving is and so is not something the state can bargain with in a `` quid pro quo '' fashion - licensing the way to live in exchange for a mandate to acquiring health insurance . <eos>

@highlight

<s> automobile insurance is `` quid pros quo '' for licenses to drive . <eos>
