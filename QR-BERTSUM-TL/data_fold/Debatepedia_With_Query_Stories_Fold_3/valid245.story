<s> civil unions : is gay marriage better than civil unions ? <eos>

<s> law unions are `` separate but not equal '' during the # s and # in the america states a segregationist principle was established called `` separate but equal '' under the jim crow laws of the time . this was struck down by the massachusetts supreme judicial court who wrote : `` the history of our nation has demonstrated that separate is seldom if ever equal . '' [ # ] law unions are precisely the same arrangement attempting to give gays a `` separate '' arrangement than marriage while conferring `` equal '' benefits . but because `` separate can never be equal '' law unions can never equal . law unions therefore are unequal segregationist and discriminatory just as were the `` separate but equal '' laws of the past . <eos>
