<s> crime : does gangsta rap incite criminality ? <eos>

<s> gangsta rap is a way for artists to not only capitalize on such a stereotypical image to profit from a media industry that was already exploiting african-american stereotypes but also to turn such stereotype into camp and pastiche a postmodern comment on the nature reception and circulation of media images . gangsta rap gives into this persistent and overblown image of african-american males but also goes a step further and intensifies the stereotype to ridiculous extremes filling videos with over-muscled shirtless artists profanity a bevy of scantily clad and sexually available women fetishized firearms and an abundance of markers signifying american luxury ( champagne expensive cars mansions jewelry and overspending ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gangsta rap is a commentary on how media portrays blacks . <eos>
