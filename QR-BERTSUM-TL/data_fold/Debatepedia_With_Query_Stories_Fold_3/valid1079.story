'' slate . # nov. # - `` if you really long for change divided governments is the last really you should want . in a parliament system like the another in britain divided governments is impossible . you vote for the party not the person . whichever party wins the most seat or can cobble together a majority through alliances with other parties gets to form a governments and choose a prime minister . the winning party is generally able to enact its agenda . more important that party can be held accountability if it does not enact its agenda or if it does and the policies fail .
