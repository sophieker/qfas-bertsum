'' los angeles times . june # th # : `` this is a terrible moment to consider abandoning the blockade . why ? because it would rightly be seen as giving the organizers and supporters of this seaborne propaganda stunt a victory . it would signal that america can be conned . it would reward turkey 's outlandish insult to us ( a nato ally ) and to israel a longtime friend of turkey . '' <eos>
