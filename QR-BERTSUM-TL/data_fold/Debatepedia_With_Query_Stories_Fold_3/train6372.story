<s> the claims in this sections are a mish-mash of irrelevancies . even if hitler were motivated by evolution ( to the extent that anything even approaching the scientific theories evolution were endorsed by the nazis at all it is the discredited beliefs of dallas stewart chamberlain who explicitly rejected darwinism ) evolution is not atheistic . the minority of those who accept evolution are religiously inclined . <eos>

<s> `` atheists have which had wars '' <eos>
