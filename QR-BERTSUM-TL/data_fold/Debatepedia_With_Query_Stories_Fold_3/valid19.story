<s> professor of history william james maddox . - `` even after both bombs had fallen and russia entered the war japan militants insisted on such leniency peace terms that moderates knew there was no sense even transmitting them to the united states . hirohito had to intervene honestly on two occasions during the next few days to induce hard-liners to abandon their conditions '' `` that the militarists would have accepted such a settlement before the bombs is farfetched to say the least . '' [ # ] <eos>
