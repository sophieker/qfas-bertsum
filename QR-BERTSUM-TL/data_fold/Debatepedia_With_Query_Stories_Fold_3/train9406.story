<s> `` dominion '' : do humans have `` dominion '' over animal justifying testing ? <eos>

<s> even if we apply the notion of `` dominion '' and if we deprive animals of rights the principle of `` dominion '' should be applied in a way that requires humans to see themselves as `` stewards '' of animals . as outlined by matthew higgins in kingdom humans should apply the principle of mercy to animals which requires that they inflict no pain or suffering on them . he writes `` we are called to treat them with kindness not because they have rights or power or some claim to equality but ... because they stand inequitable and powerless before us . '' [ # ] part of the significance of this argument is that even if we conclude animals should not have rights we can still conclude ( via the principle of mercy ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` dominion '' gives humans stewards ; no right to harm/exploit animal <eos>
