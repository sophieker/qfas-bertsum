<s> rights : do women not have a right to wearing the burqa/niqab ? <eos>

<s> `` banning the burqa . a bad idea . '' economist . may # # > `` european governments are entitled to limit women s rights to wear the burqa . in schools for example pupils should be able to see teachers faces as should judges and juries in court . but europeans should accept that however too they dislike the burka banning it entirely would be an infringement on the individual rights which their cultures normally struggles to protect . the french of all people should know that . as voltaire might have said 'i disapprove of your dress but i will defend to the death your right to wear it . ' '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> limits can be imposed on burka when required but not ban <eos>
