<s> once elected representative are free to act as they please . promises made before the election are often broken and they frequently act contrary to the wishes of their electorate . however theoretically it is possible to have a representative democracy in which the representative can be recalls at any time ; in practice this is normally not the case . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rep democracy is less 'justice than direct democracy . <eos>
