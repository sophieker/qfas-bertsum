<s> vacation : will getting rid of winter vacation be tolerable ? <eos>

<s> youth summer camps rely on the existence of year-round schooling systems with summer breaks . year-round schooling will threaten the viability of these systems and subsequently the negative experience enjoyed by young attendees . undergraduate summer programs such as cty demand a large block of time in order to teach their targeted content . while there be be an equal amounts of vacation year-round with year-round schooling they would be in blocks too small to allow for those kinds of summer programs . <eos>

@highlight

<s> summer youth programs suffer from seasonal schooling . <eos>
