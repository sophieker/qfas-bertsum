<s> cost effectiveness : are mercenaries cost effectiveness in conflicts ? <eos>

<s> although expensive to hire the government does not have to cover the cost of training housing pensions or healthcare . mercenaries unlike regular troops are only paid for the days on which they are used . military commanders can economise by reducing the size of standing armies and outsourcing roles to mercenaries as required . for example the us troops is up a third smaller than it was in the # gulf war . this saves taxpayers money and avoids the build up of conventional troops which in the last has contributed to the development of arms races .
