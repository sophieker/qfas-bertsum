<s> should mae fannie and freddie xp be dismantled ? <eos>

<s> according to uc berkeley 's economist jaffey all of the tax-payers ' bailout money had no payoffs/ benefits to the taxpayers . where did the money go ? the ceos pocketed the bailout money . furthermore while some may argue that fannie mae is unique in its ability to back security loans to middle-income and lower-income americans this is not the reality . rather the us 's rates are no good than other governments that do not interfere with their mortgage industry . this shows that by letting go our hybrid government and private lending company there will be no detractor . the money we invest toward fannie mae and freddie mac goes in the pockets of corrupt ceos rather of toward `` little '' american .
