<s> footprint : is the environmental footprint of naturally gas drilling tolerable ? <eos>

<s> `` natural gas -- a fossil fuel '' . energy information administration -- `` exploring and drilling for natural gas will always have some impact on land and aquatic habitats . but new technologies have greatly reduced the number and sizes of area disturbed by drilling sometimes called `` footprints . '' satellites global positioning systems remote sensing devices and # -d and # -d seismic technologies make it possibility to discover natural gas reserves while drilling fewer wells . plus the use of horizontal and directional drilling make it possibility for a single well to produce gas from much bigger area than in the past .
