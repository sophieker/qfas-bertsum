<s> incentives : does socialism provide the way economic incentives ? <eos>

<s> this is a driving force vital for the developing of human society . some people are clearly gifted more than others from the very moment of birth . as unfair as it may seem ( or but as unfair as it is ) the only sensible thing one can do about it is to help the more gifted people to excel ( while of course building upon the not so extraordinary yet valuable work of others ) and learn something new from them . by promote a classless society socialism inevitably hinders the individual developing and professionalism forging people into one uniform gray mass . capitalism at the very least does n't principally prevent an individual from excelling . <eos>

@highlight

<s> communism removes the incentive to excel . <eos>
