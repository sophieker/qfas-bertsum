<s> not torture ? is it mistake to calling water-boarding torture ? <eos>

<s> - waterboarding seems to match the definition of the # bybee memo in which assistant aj jay bybee defined torture as `` physical pain amounting to torture must be equivalent in intense to the pain accompanied serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of physical function or even death '' . waterboarding certainly fits the criteria of `` impairment of physical function '' since breathing can obviously be considered a major `` bodily function '' . also because lungs are organ filling them with water does meeting the criteria of inducing `` organ failure '' . <eos>

<s> waterboarding but fits the bybee memo definition of torture <eos>
