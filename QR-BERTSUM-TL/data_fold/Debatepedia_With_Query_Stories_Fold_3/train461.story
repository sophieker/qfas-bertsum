<s> vs. public insurance : are co-ops a great alternatives to public insurance ? <eos>

<s> while it is entirely true that co-ops are a great option and should be encouraged they are not a substitutes for a national insurance plan . this has a lot to do with the fact that co-ops simply can not scale as well as public insurance to solve the problems of millions of uninsured americans . as house speaker nancy pelosi ( d-calif. ) said in august of # `` if someone thinks a co-op can working for their state let them go and do it . [ but they are no substitutes for public insurance ] . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> non-profit co-ops are great but no substitutes for private insurances <eos>
