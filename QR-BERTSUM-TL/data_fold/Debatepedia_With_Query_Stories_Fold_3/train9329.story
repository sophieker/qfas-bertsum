<s> competition : which more effectively allows competition for the people 's attention ? <eos>

<s> as everybody knows monopolies are sometimes formed under capitalist systems . corporations were first chartered with the aim of gaining a monopoly over anything area the monarchs chartered them in . so the need to monopolize is built into the basic logic of capitalism . the giant multinationals that dominate world trade are proof of this . on the other hand no monopolies exist in genuine socialism so there is no transfer of wealth to the centre or the pushing out of large locally group - two importance characteristics of monopolies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism is characterised by monopolistic not competition . <eos>
