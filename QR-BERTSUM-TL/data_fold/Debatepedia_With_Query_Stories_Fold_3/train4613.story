<s> does banning hate speech on campus infringe the right of free speech ? <eos>

<s> it is generally agreed that an individual s rights extend so far as they do not infringe the rights of another . minorities have a right to be free from verbal abuse and fear . if such rights are not being respected then it is necessary to legislate . this is especially important given the divers cultural and ethnic mix in our universities . the university authorities have a duty to ensure that the campus is a welcoming place for everyone and therefore it is necessary to censor hate speech . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the rights which we enjoy in democratic countries also come with responsibilities . <eos>
