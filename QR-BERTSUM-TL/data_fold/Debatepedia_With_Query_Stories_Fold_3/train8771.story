<s> social : would legalization entail heavy socio-economic costs ? <eos>

<s> if we need to produce a better society there is some rooms for `` big brother '' regulations to prevent citizens from doing harm to themselves . this is especially appropriate in the contexts of some individuals not having a `` choice '' in the matter in the sense that they grow up in an environment that exposes them to marijuana and in which they do n't have any knowledge of marijuana 's costs . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cannabis is the drugs for life 's losers <eos>
