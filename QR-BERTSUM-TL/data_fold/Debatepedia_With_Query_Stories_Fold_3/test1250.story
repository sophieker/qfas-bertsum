<s> guilt as criteria : should guilt be the primary criteria for trials not whether a defendant has been tried before ? <eos>

<s> when asked what did you see ? a witness is likely to reply what did i say last time ? ' . it s no longer a true test of evidence ; the evidence from the last trial is all presumed to be accurate and can t be satisfactorily challenged . [ 7 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> guilt is not verifiable in the same way in a second trial . <eos>
