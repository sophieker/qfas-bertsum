<s> jobs : does mountaintop removal cost/create jobs ? <eos>

<s> mountain justice : `` traditional mining communities disappear as jobs diminish and residents are driven away by dust blasting and increased flooding and dangers from overloaded coal trucks careening down small windy mountain roads . mining companies buy many of the homes and tear them down . dynamite is cheaper than people so mountaintop removal mining does not create many new jobs . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> mountaintop mining is generally not a big job-creator . <eos>
