<s> should cage fighting ( or mma ) be banning for it being too violent ? <eos>

<s> `` cage fighting is nothing more than a human cockfight . it pits two human beings with no prior argument into a caged in arena where they attempt as harder as they can to cause as much pain as possible to the other man . there is no rooms for such a barbaric sport in today 's society . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> mixed kickboxing arts promotes an entertainment comparable to the gladiator fights in the roman colosseum <eos>
