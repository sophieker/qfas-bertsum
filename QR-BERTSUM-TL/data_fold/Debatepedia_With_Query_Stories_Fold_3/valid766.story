<s> stability country : can afghanistan be making into a stability country/democracy ? <eos>

<s> while the we and nato would try to focus on state-building and democratic institution-building in afghanistan this is too grandiose a goal and unnecessary . the initial post- # / # goal was to get rid of the qaeda and prevent afg from continuing as a safe haven for terrorists . this goal remains legitimate and any larger state-building goals should be seen as non-essential . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us want not state-build in kabul but counter terrorist <eos>
