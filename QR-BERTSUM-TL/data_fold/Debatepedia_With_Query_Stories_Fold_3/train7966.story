<s> emissions : is naturally gas clean when burned for energy ? <eos>

<s> `` natural gas -- a fossil fuel '' . energy information administration . - `` natural gas burns more neatly than other fossil fuels . it has fewer emission of sulfur carbon and nitrogen than mining or oil and when it is burned it leaves almost no ash particles . being a cleaned fuel is another fact that the use of natural gas particularly for electricity generation has grown so much and is expect to grow even more in the future . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> naturally gas can replace fossil fuels that emit more greenhouse gasses <eos>
