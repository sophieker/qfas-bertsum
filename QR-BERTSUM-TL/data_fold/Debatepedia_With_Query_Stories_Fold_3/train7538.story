<s> momentum : is propel move in the direction of a common foreign policy ? <eos>

<s> this language is not too different from what we have heard with every attempt the eu has made to push for further political integration . the role of the common foreign and security policy ( cfsp ) as agreed upon back in # during the maastricht treaty was in fact presented very too along similar lines . fifteen years later however that united front has not been created . if anything the eu s political union and certain any attempts toward a common foreign policy have completely disintegrated when facing with the war in iraq and the larger war on terror . consultation collaboration and the attempted creation of a common set of values has not worked and is not likely to work in a climate <eos>

@highlight

<s> moves towards a common foreign policy have been only nominal . <eos>
