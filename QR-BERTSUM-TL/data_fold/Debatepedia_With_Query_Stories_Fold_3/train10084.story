<s> military humanism : would intervention improve the humanitarian situation ? <eos>

<s> noam chomsky 's the new military humanism makes the case that nato forces committed atrocities as bad or worse than the genocide that led to nato 's intervention in # . he argues that the united states and nato do not hold themselves to the same humanitarian international-legal standards as it expects from other countries . nevertheless the united states and nato are the most likely to lead any intervention in darfur . those that advocate for intervention should understand this reality and the accompanying risks of us-nato action . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us and nato humanitarian military interventions bring their own set of atrocities <eos>
