<s> health care : which candidate 's health care plans is superior ? <eos>

<s> hillary 's health health plans mandates that all uninsured citizens buy health care . many can not afford to do so and so wo n't . the problem surrounds what you do at that stage . do you then as barack critically asks punish these individuals by for instance dill their wages ? this would be highly divisive as it is in massachusetts and unpolitical . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hillary 's healthcare care plan has unenforceable unpolitical mandates . <eos>
