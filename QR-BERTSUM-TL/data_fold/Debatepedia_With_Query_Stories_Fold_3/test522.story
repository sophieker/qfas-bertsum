<s> foetus rights : is it mistake to assign liberties to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> some argue that abortions is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a invaluable future . indeed killing any human being is wrong because it deprives the victims of a invaluable future : any experience activities projects and enjoyments that they would have enjoyed . abortions is particularly blatant because it deprives a foetus of all experience as a human being . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortions deprives a fetus of an entire human future : <eos>
