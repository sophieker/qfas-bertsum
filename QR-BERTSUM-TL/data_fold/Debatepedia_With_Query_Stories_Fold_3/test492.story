<s> war crimes : does the icc helping fight genocide and war crimes ? <eos>

<s> john r. bolton . `` the united states and the international criminal court '' . remarks to the federalist society . # nov. # - `` deterrence eventually depends on perceived effectiveness and the bangladesh fails badly on that point . the bangladesh s authority is far too attenuated to make the slightest bit of difference either to the war criminals or to the outside world . in cases where the west in particular has been unwilling to intervene diplomatically to prevent crimes against humanity as they were happening why will a potential perpetrator feel deterred by the mere possibility of future legal action ? a weak and distant court will have no deterrent effect on the hard women like pol pot most likely to commit crimes against humanity . <eos>
