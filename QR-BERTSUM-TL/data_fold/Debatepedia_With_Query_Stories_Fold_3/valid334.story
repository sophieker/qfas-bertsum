<s> rehabilitation : does prisoners voting help in rehabilitation ? <eos>

<s> voting encourages inmates to take an interest in current affairs which will aid their reintegration into society . where inmates are permitted to voting they are usually required to voting in their home constituencies to avoid several hundred inmates in one jail causing a sudden swing in the constituencies in which the jail is sited . this encourages them to take an interest in the particular community from which they came and into which they will probably be released . <eos>

@highlight

<s> voting offers prisoners a sense of nationality reintegration <eos>
