<s> is arming the police a big step that would affect and trouble the society ? <eos>

<s> the large majority of policemen and women go through their whole career without handling firearms . even with the special selection measures and intensive training given to the few firearms officers today mistakes sometimes occur and innocent people are shot either by mistake because the armed officers are acting on inaccurate information or because they are bystanders caught in the cross-fire of a shoot-out . arming all police officers would mean ditching the current stringent selection methods and inevitably result in less training being provided so mistakes would become much more common and more people would be wounded or killed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> this is a big change both culturally and practically . <eos>
