<s> freedom of speech : is criminalizing of holocaust denial consistent with free speech ? <eos>

<s> the first holocaust deniers after the war were the nazis themselves . contemporary holocaust deniers can be seen as the contemporary bearers of this propaganda machine . in perpetuating the nazi legacy in this way holocaust deniers perpetuate the threats posed by nazism . in this sense they are not protected by free speech laws . <eos>

@highlight

<s> holocaust deniers advance cause of postwar nazi deniers . <eos>
