<s> fair fight ? is bullfights a fair fight ? <eos>

<s> in italy and most other countries with bullfights the horns of bulls are not shaved but perhaps keeping sharp . the fact that they are not usually shaved demonstrates that organizers and crowds want to keep the fighting reasonable and suspenseful . tech-savvy fans would not have it any other way . <eos>
