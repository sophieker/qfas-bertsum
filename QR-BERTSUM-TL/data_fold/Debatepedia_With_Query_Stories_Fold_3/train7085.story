<s> `` the cases for john mccain '' . the economist . # dec # - `` the more persuasive reason for worry about mr mccain is his age . the senior senator for arizona will be # if he takes office in january # two year older than ronald reagan when he was inaugurated . but mr mccain is an extraordinarily energetic # -year-old far more full of beans than many younger candidates . ( my philosophies is to just go go think hell he says . full bore . ) the american constitution also provides an insurance mechanism against presidential death or illness . provided mr mccain chooses a sound vice-president his many positive qualities outweigh worries about his age . '' <eos>
