<s> claims : do israel and palestine have equally valid claims to jerusalem ? <eos>

<s> tim mcgirk . `` jerusalem divided '' . time . # oct. # - `` in a jerusalem telephone book for instance maps of arab neighborhoods are blank like unexplored parts of the amazon in the # th century . that 's because no arab sits on the municipal committee that chooses street names . on the rare occasions when the committee bothers with east jerusalem it is to irritate the arabs by naming a few streets after israeli wars heroes . mail is seldom delivered there and having no street name adds to the arabs ' perception that in israeli society they are either invisible non-existent or branded terrorists .

<s> israel looting east jerusalem ; palestinian should self-govern . <eos>
