<s> depression : are women usually content with a past decision to abort ? <eos>

<s> this argument is partly a response to studies that claim that there is a correlation between abortion and mental disorders . the point is that this might be true but the causality of this correlation must be determined . it may be that those with existing mental disorders are more likely to take risks that lead to the need for abortion and that this is the explanation for the correlation rather than that abortion leads to mental disorders . <eos>

@highlight

<s> risk-taking and disorders lead to abortions ; not the opposite <eos>
