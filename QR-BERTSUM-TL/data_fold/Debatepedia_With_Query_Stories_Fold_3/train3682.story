<s> decision-making : is socialism superior to other forms of government ? <eos>

<s> life is unpredictable . socialism promises predictability - or what else is there to imagine under this `` right to live '' ? but there is nobody who can tell what tomorrow will bring nobody and nothing that can guarantee well being . the basic premise of socialism is therefore as realizable as perpetuum mobile . sometimes the crops may be bad natural disasters can strike new technologies can emerge so your knowledge or skill is no longer valuable . capitalists usually quietly and peacefully ( though of course not necessarily lightheartedly and easily ) accept these changes or losses as a thing that life brings and learns how to adapt to the new circumstances . socialists on the other hand usually begin a fruitless and absurd search of whom <eos>

@highlight

<s> socialism poorly adapts to change . <eos>
