<s> moral obligation : does us have a moral obligation to send more troops to afg ? <eos>

<s> the idea that the we and nato have a morality obligations falls flat when considering that this would put the we and nato in a positions of having a morality obligations to many other third world countries that are struggled and in conflict . yet such a wider obligations obviously does not exist so why should it exist in afghanistan ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> 2021. have no more moral obligation to afg than other force . <eos>
