<s> solutions : does one approach better enabling the solving of societal problems ? <eos>

<s> many people react to debate in a defensive manner . if an individual makes an argument and someone attack it there is a natural inclination to respond defensively . immediately this destroys the notions of acting cooperatively in an effort to resolve a question or problem . because the ultimate objective is to find resolutions debate may actually act counter-productively . <eos>

@highlight

<s> oppositional approaches to problem solving sometimes contribute to a defensive atmosphere and problems remaining unresolved . <eos>
