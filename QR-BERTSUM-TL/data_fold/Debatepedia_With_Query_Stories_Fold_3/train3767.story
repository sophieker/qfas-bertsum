<s> abuse : could legalization avoid opening a slippery slope to abuse and murder ? <eos>

<s> there is very little historical evidence of doctors actually coercing patients into accepting euthanasia against their will . part of the reason is that it is a major leap from patients having to request euthanasia to doctors forcing it upon them . it reality it is not a very plausible leap particularly with the number of checks that would be in place against such abuses upon legalization . <eos>

@highlight

<s> history does not suggest doctors coerce patients into euthanasia <eos>
