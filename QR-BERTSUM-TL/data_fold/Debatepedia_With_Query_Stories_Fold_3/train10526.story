<s> a notes on the presumption of innocent <eos>

<s> an important strategic choice the affirmative should make is whether to argue against the practice of plea bargaining as whole or just plea bargaining in exchange for testimony . affirmative could try to argue first that plea bargaining is in general unjust but then contend that but if this were n't truth that plea bargaining in exchange of testimony is unjust . adopting a two tiered `` even if '' approach to affirming is always fairly riskier since the dangers is the appearance that the affirmative is contradictory . further the negative could always concede that plea bargaining in general is wrong but that when its necessary to elicit testimony it is just . <eos>
