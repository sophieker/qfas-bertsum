<s> environment : is hunting environmentally friendly ? <eos>

<s> jimmy stewart - `` animals give me more pleasure through the viewfinder of a camera than they ever did in the crosshairs of a gunsight . and after i 've finished `` shooting `` my unharmed victims are still around for others to enjoy . i have developed a deep respect for animals . i consider them fellow living creatures with certain rights that should not be violated any more than those of humans . '' [ 19 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> animals better observed/photographed than killed for sport <eos>
