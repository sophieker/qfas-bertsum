<s> do citizens feeling great about armed police ? <eos>

<s> many law-abiding citizens who have no connections to the criminal underworld are horrified by armed police whom they regard as alien to their cultural frame of reference . lethal weaponry is a potent symbol of possibility brutality . this can undermine the ability of the police to be seen as a key constituent part of law society . this problem is exacerbated when this symbolic brutality is applied in ways that deviate from the expectation of law society for example through unfair racial profiling . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arming the police delegitimises their role as communities standards bearers . <eos>
