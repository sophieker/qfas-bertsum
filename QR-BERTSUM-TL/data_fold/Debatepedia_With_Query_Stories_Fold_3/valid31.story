<s> muslims that wear the headscarf are creating a separation between themselves and other people in a society . this is particularly true because the headscarf is design to conceal a woman 's appearance from others in societies ( namely men ) . in this way the headscarf is clearly design to isolate and separated a woman from others in a society . this is unhealthy for a woman and for other individuals that would benefits from interacting more deeply with that individual . <eos>
