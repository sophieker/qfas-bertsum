<s> labor ethics - is the tourism industry creating ethical domestic employment for host countries ? <eos>

<s> these multi-national corporations ( mncs ) are usually welcome despite the fact that the profit they make in a majority of cases does not stay within the borders of the host country . local labour is exploited because it is cheap environment is destroyed without punishment because there usually are no treaties or contracts to force the mncs to pollute less ( this applies mostly for the developing countries ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many hotels are part of large international chains choosing to exploit local labour purely because it is cheap . <eos>
