<s> cultural freedom : does arranged marriage breach the principle of cultural freedom ? <eos>

<s> . even within any ethnic community there is variety and difference . it is misleading to treat all arranged marriage as one homogeneous system . although cross-cultural elements are a part of the debate this is more than the west versus the east old ways versus new ways or patriarchal cultures dominating women . a part of the difficulty in understanding the variety of arranged marriage stemmed from the fact that many western cultures had arranged marriage or types of arranged marriage that were based on finance and patriarchy . this does not think all arranged marriage systems function in such a manner . rather such a viewpoint may be a case of observer bias where western critiques only see arranged marriage through their own <eos>

<s> the matters may be of culture liberty or multicultural liberty <eos>
