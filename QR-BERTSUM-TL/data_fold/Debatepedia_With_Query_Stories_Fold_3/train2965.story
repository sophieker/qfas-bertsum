<s> free speech : is pornography protected by free speech ? <eos>

<s> usually the debate over pornography does not relate to whether it should be banned as a whole but rather whether individuals should continue to watch it whether it can be healthy in marriages whether hotels should offer it whether prisoners should be allowed access etc . arguing against a ban on pornography based on free speech justifications is therefore a bit of a red herring . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debate over merits of porn usually do n't relate to ban . <eos>
