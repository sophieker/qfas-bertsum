<s> economics : which is more cost-effective or efficient ? <eos>

<s> capitalism is based on the idea that services and goods will exist only because there is a demand for them . they will not exist if persons do not want them as demand will fall and a company providing a good or service will simply go out of business . resources will not be wasted on the good and services not wanted and instead will eventually be putting behind those that are wanted . and the system constantly adjusts itself to make sure it supplies what what people actually want in what the amounts that are actually demanded . this is because a company will not generate much revenue to sustain supplying more than is actually demanded . socialism paradoxically relies to a higher extent <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism provide people with what they actually want . <eos>
