<s> burma : should china 's response to the burma crisis be cause for a boycott ? <eos>

<s> china is not responsible for taking action against burma . china has a foreign policy not to interfere in other countries ' affairs . it 's inaction during the burma crisis of # therefore is consistent with this policy which is generally an acceptable international principle with many nations choosing to adopt neutral or reserved foreign policies . while americans may adopt a more moralistically interventionist stance obviously this has led to many consequences in iraq yugoslavia somalia panama and in many other countries around the world . the case can certainly be made that a non-interventionist policy is ideal . <eos>
