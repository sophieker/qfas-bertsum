<s> individual liberty : should individuals be at liberty to using marijuana ? <eos>

<s> many people seem to be under the impression that the use of illegal drugs is something that be be forced on someone . however unless coerced by force this is normally not the case . because laws are a whole of our everyday lives we are taught what things are legal and illegal by law through life experience . by definition illegal drugs are not legal to use . since cannabis is illegal then use cultivation sell and distribution is illegal as well . one does n't have to be aware of the moral or health related issue that go along with something to know that it 's illegal . therefore if someone wishes to commit an illegal act then the punishment for getting caught is the punishment <eos>

@highlight

<s> use of marijuana ( illegally ) is a choice . <eos>
