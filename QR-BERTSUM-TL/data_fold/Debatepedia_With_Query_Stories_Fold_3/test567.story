<s> artificial turf fields are much more durable than grass ; because playability is much higher they allow broader access ; can be played on all the time ; in time of scarce fields they give youth sports organizations practice space they might otherwise not have ; the problem of spring and fall rains which result in cancellation of numerous games and practices slated for grass fields is eliminated ; one match on a muddy field can ruin the field for the rest of the season . <eos>

@highlight

<s> increased playability . <eos>
