<s> should on-line gambling be banned ? <eos>

<s> when it has been banned people have just used sites based in other countries . it is better to legalize and regulate on-line gambling than to drive gambling to poorly-regulated foreign operators . regulation can reducing the problem identify by the proposition . for example on-line gambling can be required to give personal details when registering ( e.g . occupation income ) . if this information suggests they are spending more than they can afford the company can block their credit card . in any case most on-line gambling do not get addicted . why should they be denied an activities that they enjoy ? <eos>
