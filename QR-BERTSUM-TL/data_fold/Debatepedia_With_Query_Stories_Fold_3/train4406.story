<s> efficiency : is the privatization of industries a exceptional economic course ? <eos>

<s> natural monopolies can emerged through the markets but their dominance inhibits the market forces that are most frequently cited as a source of efficiency . in such instances since market forces are not fully at work there may be fewer reasons to keep such a monopoly in the private markets and the nationalization of that monopoly might making sense . <eos>

@highlight

<s> natural monopolies are by definition not subject to competition and may be good administer by the state . <eos>
