<s> felix salmon . `` why the greek bailout won t work . '' reuters . may # # : `` the reason is that the bailout package really doesn t address the problem which is one of solvency perhaps than liquidity . the european loans are being extended at about # % which while much lower than market rates is still not low enough to make anything approaching a dent in greece s debt dynamics . and by the time the bailout package is exhausted if greece even gets that far its assemble ratio will be considerably higher than it is right now thank to both a rising numerator and a declining denominator .
