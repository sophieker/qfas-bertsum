<s> consumption : would legalization decrease drug-consumption ? <eos>

<s> - teenagers are often attracted to rebellious activities as their freedoms as individuals are expanded and the as the control of parents recedes . much research indicates that placing limitations on teenage activities may actually produce the unintended result encouraging the teenager to rebelliously disobey and break the limitations . similarly placing legal limitations on the consumption of marijuana may actually motivate teenagers to consumer the drug as a glamorous act of rebellion . this is flushed out by statistics suggesting that cannabis use in the uk has actually declined since its classification was lowered from b to c . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legalization of drugs will remove the rebellious glamor of it <eos>
