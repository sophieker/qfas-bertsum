<s> `` bush lifts ban on offshore drilling '' . cbs . 14 july 2008 : `` democrats say they are for drilling but argue that oil companies are n't going after the oil where they already have leases . so why open new protected areas ? they ask . democrats say there are 68 million acres of federal land and waters where oil and gas companies hold leases but are n't producing oil . '' <eos>
