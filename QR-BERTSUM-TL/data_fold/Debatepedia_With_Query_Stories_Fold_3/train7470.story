<s> debt : do developed states have a responsibility to increased aid ? <eos>

<s> this is one of the good contradictions of climate change : that while developed countries causing it poor countries may suffer the most . this is because many of the terrible effects may happen around the equator where the impact of drought and flooding may be most severe on water-supply and on crops and foods supply . due to this irony/unfairness developed nations are particularly burdens to provide climate aid to helped poor nations adapt . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor nations are most likely to lose from warming change . <eos>
