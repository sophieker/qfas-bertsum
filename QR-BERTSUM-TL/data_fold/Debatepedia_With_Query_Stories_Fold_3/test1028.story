<s> militia : is a handgun unimportant to a militia ? is the militia meaningless today ? <eos>

<s> historically the militias that resisted the british was a non state manage association of people that were fighting against tyranny . the wording of the second amendments preserves the spirit of that time and therefore the word `` militia '' can be relevant to nowadays as a symbol of the right of people to fighting against tyranny.in this way the spirit of the time is reflected in the letter of the law . <eos>

@highlight

<s> militias are relevant yesterday as a symbol of preventing tyranny <eos>
