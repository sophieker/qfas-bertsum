<s> democracy : does nato membership help liberalize countries ? <eos>

<s> . the policy that received strong support under the clinton administration involves regular consultations exercises and opportunities for education that seek to professionalize the civilian and military institutions of the republics of the former soviet union . this policy of genuine aid is preferable to the wish-list of democratic ideals that compose the criteria for nato membership . paradoxically were one of the republics actually able to achieve all the criteria delineated the necessity for their nato protection would be marginal . conversely were the republics predictably unable to realize these goals the protection of nato through expansion or pfp would be genuine . yet it is in these situations of tenuous stability that states will be denied proper civilian and military aid from <eos>

<s> stability in new democracies would be best achieved through `` partnership for peace '' <eos>
