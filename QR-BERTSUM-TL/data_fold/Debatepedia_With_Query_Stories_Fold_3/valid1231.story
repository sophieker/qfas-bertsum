<s> historical lessons : does history suggest the war in afghanistan can not be won ? <eos>

<s> peter navarro . `` orange grove : get out of afghanistan now '' oc register . september 25 2009 : `` during my senior year in high school in 1966-67 our local congressman came to speak to us soon-to-be-draftees about the necessity of the vietnam war . his basic pitch was a frothy combination of red menace yellow peril and domino theory . [ ... ] the speech rang as hollow as a beer keg after a frat party . [ ... ] today i get the same kind of hollowness in my gut every time i hear president barack obama and a gaggle of democratic and republican hawks offer eerily similar arguments for the afghanistan war . terrorism is the new red menace . yellow peril has morphed into radical islam . dominoes perhaps surprisingly <eos>

<s> fear-mongering used in escalating afg war was used in vietnam <eos>
