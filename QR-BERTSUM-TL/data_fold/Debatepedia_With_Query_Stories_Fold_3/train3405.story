<s> colleges/applicants : should colleges searching applicant profiles on social networks sites ? <eos>

<s> imagining that colleges do search on social networking sites to find candidates it should be understood that only the applicants which have becoming a members of such sites would be seeing and gain advantage . but what about those who do n't becoming a members in any of the social networking sites available on the web ? the problem is that there are bad students out there who are really smart and deserve university admission but pity for them they do not have enough resources to get a computer and establish a personal profile on a social networking site . therefore a system in which colleges search for applicants will only promote an unfair admission of students . <eos>

@highlight

<s> admission officers that searching profile put those without access at a disadvantage . <eos>
