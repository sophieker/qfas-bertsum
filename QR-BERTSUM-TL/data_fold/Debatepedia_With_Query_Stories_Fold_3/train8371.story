<s> tyranny of majority : is it wrong to call progressive taxation this ? <eos>

<s> carl henn . `` taxation without exacerbation '' . letter to washington times . # mar . # - `` many of the richest people support progressive taxation which provides some argument that progressive taxation is n't tyranny but rather a policy option with which mr. rahn disagrees . to call these tax policies `` tyranny '' is sloppy . why is it important to correct sloppy thinking ? because sloppy thinking has consequences . revolt may be an acceptable response to tyranny . it is n't an appropriate response to mismanagement . inflammatory rhetoric does not promote reasoned public debate . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> calling progressive taxation `` tyrannical '' is inappropriate <eos>
