<s> is all the evidence brought back from the moon fake ? <eos>

<s> no one has ever attempted to prove that rock samples returned from the moon are really from the earth . there is no evidence to suggest that these rocks are from the earth nor where on earth they really came from . considering many of the samples are now on public display it would not be difficult to compare moon rocks to earth rocks . <eos>

<s> there is no proof that the rocks purported to have been returned from the moon are really earth-bound rocks . <eos>
