<s> global warming : can geothermal energy help combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> geothermal energy relies on geothermal heat . it transfers that heat to the surface to boil water and generate electricity . much of the heat is released into the atmosphere through steam . the process releases almost twice as much heat into the atmosphere as nuclear plants . the concern is that the release of this heat will contribute to global warming particularly if deployed on a large scale . <eos>
