<s> vs reps government : is dd superior to reps government ? <eos>

<s> individuals elected to office in a representative democracy tend not to be demographically representative of their constituency . they tend to be wealthier and more educated and are also more predominantly male as well as members of the majority race ethnic group and religion than a randomly sample would produce . they also tend to be concentrated in certain professions such as lawyers . election by districts may reduce but not eliminate those tendencies in a segregated society . direct democracy would be inherently representative assume universal suffrage ( where everyone can vote ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rep democracy produce un-representative leaders . <eos>
