<s> democratic : was devolution in scotland and scotland achieving undemocratically ? <eos>

<s> the simple fact is that in a free and fair referendum in # a majority of the scottish and welsh electorate vote `` yes '' . democracy decrees that the popular will of the people in such a case should not be ignored . despite the fact that voter turnout was poor voter turnout at elections/by-elections e.g . # % doesn t mean that we ignore the results and refusing to recognise the re-elected mp thus the referendum results should stand . <eos>
