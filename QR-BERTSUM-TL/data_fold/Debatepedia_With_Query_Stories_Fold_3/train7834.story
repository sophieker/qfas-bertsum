<s> violence : is violent never justified in civil disobedience ? <eos>

<s> if the cause is good and just such violence may be justified . indeed the american revolution was a violent revolution and many american historians argue that it was a justification reaction to king george iii . if a violent revolution can be regarded just than violent civil-disobedience can be just as but again assume the cause is just . <eos>

@highlight

<s> violence can be a meaning to bringing attention to a cause . <eos>
