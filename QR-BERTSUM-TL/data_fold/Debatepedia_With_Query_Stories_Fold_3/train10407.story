[ ... ] that 's precisely what happened during the civilian new york trial of the 1993 world trade center bombers . the prosecution was forced to turn over to the defense a list of two hundred unindicted co-conspirators including the name osama bin laden . 'within ten days a copy of that list reached bin laden in khartoum ' wrote former attorney general michael mukasey the presiding judge at that trial 'letting him know that his connection to that case had been discovered .
