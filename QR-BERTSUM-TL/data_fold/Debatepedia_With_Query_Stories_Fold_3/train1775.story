<s> universal jurisdiction : is this icc principle legitimate ? <eos>

<s> henry kissinger . `` the pitfalls of universal jurisdiction : risking judicial tryanny '' . foreign affairs . aug. # - `` the doctrine of universal jurisdictions asserts that some crimes are so heinous that their perpetrators should not escape justice by invoking doctrines of sovereignty immunity or the sacrosanct nature of national frontiers [ ... ] the very concept of universal jurisdictions is of recent vintage . [ ... ] it is unlikely that any of the signatories of either the u.n. conventions or the helsinki final act thought it possible that national judges could use them as a basis for extradition requests regarding allegedly crimes committed outside their jurisdictions . the drafters almost certainly claimed that they were stating general principles not laws that could be enforced by national courts .
