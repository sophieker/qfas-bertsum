<s> justice/desert : are executions often required to uphold mujki desert ? <eos>

<s> if the death penalty is considered a `` proportional '' punishment for someone who commit # murder would n't we need a harsher sentence for a person that tortures and murders # people ? if proportionality is the model we might have to torture criminals in order to exert sufficient punishment . therefore the inherent flaw in a concept of justice based on `` proportionality '' is that it has no limits create a slippery slope to torture in the names of justice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rapists might `` deserve '' death but decency requires mercy <eos>
