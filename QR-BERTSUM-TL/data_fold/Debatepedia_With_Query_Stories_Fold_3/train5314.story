<s> civilians : who is in the right in regard to civilian casualties ? <eos>

<s> `` israel 's gaza defense '' . wall street journal . december # th # - `` israel 's air assault has resulted in more palestinian casualties but that is in part because hamas deliberately locates its security forces in residential neighborhoods . this is intended both to deter israel from attacking in the first place as well as to turning world opinion against the jews state when it does attack . by all accounts although the israeli strikes have hit their targets precisely enough to do significant damage to hamas forces -- both to its leadership and on sunday to the tunnels from gaza to egypt that hamas utilizes to smuggle in weapons and build its growing army .
