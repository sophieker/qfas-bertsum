<s> non-experts : is it invaluable or bad that non-experts can editing on wikipedia ? <eos>

<s> wikpedia has a very community-based ethic . this gives little credit to `` experts '' . in reason wikipedians often abhor `` experts '' . this undermines the involvement of experts and scholars in editing on the site which undermines the quality of articles as but as the credibility that the public affords to the site . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wikipedia 's anti-elitism has repaired its quality and credibility <eos>
