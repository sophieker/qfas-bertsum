<s> global economy : does free trade benefit the global economy ? <eos>

<s> some criticize the results of some modern attempts at free trade such as nafta . but others contend that such examples may not be a reasonable example of `` fair trade '' as it could be ideally built but rather of a extremely managed form of trade . therefore the failures of managed free trade up to this point should not be used too dramatically as a condemning of the potential of real `` free trade '' in the future . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is manage trading not free that is the problem <eos>
