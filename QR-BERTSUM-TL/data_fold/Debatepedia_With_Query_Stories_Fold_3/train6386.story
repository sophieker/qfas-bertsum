<s> `` the people '' : does `` the people '' confer an individual right or a collective right ? <eos>

<s> regarding a meaning of `` the people '' in another context the u.s. supreme court commented in united states v. verdugo-urquidez 494 u.s. 259 ( 1990 ) - `` `` the people '' seems to be a term of art used in select parts of the constitution and contrasts with the words `` person '' and `` accused '' used in articles of the fifth and sixth amendments regulating criminal procedures . this suggests that `` the people '' refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community . '' [ 7 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> the people '' in the second amendment refers to a collective right to arms <eos>
