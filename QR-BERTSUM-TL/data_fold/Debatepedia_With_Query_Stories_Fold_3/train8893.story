<s> foreign policy : <eos>

<s> barack obama ever said `` i apologize for america '' as so many off-base republicans have argued . rather he was separating himself from the harmful worldview of the bush administration that launched the war in iraq opened guantanamo and initiated enhanced interrogations ( or torture as many call it ) . he was criticizing bush 's policies and recognising the mistakes that his administration made which is completely different than `` apologizing '' for america . he has always talked about the example america provides to the world how it 's the `` greatest nation on earth `` and how it will always growing and lead the world . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama never apologized for us he repudiate bush policies . <eos>
