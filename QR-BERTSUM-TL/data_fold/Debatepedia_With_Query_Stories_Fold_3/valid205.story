<s> enforceability : could a globally taxes be enforceable ? <eos>

<s> there are two main enforcement mechanisms that could be adopted : # ) taxation of currency trades desks in a certain jurisdiction and # ) taxation of a certain currency . in the first case the jurisdiction would collect the money while in the second case the national bank significant with a certain currency would collect the money . given that most proposals suggest that the tax be sets at a very low level ( # . # % of transaction values ) it would not be worth it to trying to evade the tax . given that most transactions are now electronic transactions tracking mechanisms ( developed already to counter terrorist and criminal money laundering ) are easily accessible and monitored .
