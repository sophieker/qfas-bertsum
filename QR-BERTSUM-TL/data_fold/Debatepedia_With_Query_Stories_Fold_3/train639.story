<s> `` is carbon trading a market mechanism ? '' : `` there appears to be a misconception among many 'lay economists ' that carbon trading is a 'market mechanism ' while carbon taxes are not . however government control of the quantity of an item being sold is no more of a market based mechanism than government control of the price . where it counts carbon taxes make far better use of market forces than carbon trading schemes .
