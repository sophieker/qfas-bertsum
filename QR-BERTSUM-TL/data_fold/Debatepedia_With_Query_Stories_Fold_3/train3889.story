<s> ocean energy council : tidal energy - `` there is only one major tidal generating station in operation . this is a 240 megawatt ( 1 megawatt = 1 mw = 1 million watts ) at the mouth of the la rance river estuary on the northern coast of france ( a large coal or nuclear power plant generates about 1 000 mw of electricity ) . '' <eos>
