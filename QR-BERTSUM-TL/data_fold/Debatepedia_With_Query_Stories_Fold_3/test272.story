<s> resources : are annex i states more obligated due to greater resources ? <eos>

<s> developed countries do not have a greater obligation to combat global warming and provide aid for adaptation as a result of them having more resources . it would be generous of them to contribute more . but it is not a greater obligation or responsibility . the same is true of the wealthy working man who may choose ( or not ) to give money to those suffering from a natural disaster . it may be a good thing to give but it is no obligation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> resources of developed countries do not obligate climate aid . <eos>
