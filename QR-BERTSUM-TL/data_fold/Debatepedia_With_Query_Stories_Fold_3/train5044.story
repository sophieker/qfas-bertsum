<s> maintenance : are tidal energy plants easy and cheap to maintain ? <eos>

<s> tidal energy technologies have been around for centuries because it is so simple . barage systems are as simple and easy to maintain as a dam . turbine systems involve propellers rotating around an axis which is attached to a generator . the simplicity of this design makes it possible to design strong tidal turbines that require very few tidal repairs . therefore even if underwater repairs are expensive they are so infrequent that the costs are negligible in the long-run . <eos>
