<s> foetus rights : is it wrong to assign rights to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> no human beings are in an entirely different class . we are called not to murder human life not acorns . it 's not the stage of development it 's the precious value of humans . pro-lifers focus only on the early stage of development and ignore the specialness and reverence we should have for even a small ( but growing ) human life . a lives develop human fetus by definition is a human life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no one argues that an acorn or but an animal foetus has a sanctity or rights . <eos>
