<s> david carlin . `` why i 'm not a republican . '' inside catholic . september # th # : `` # . democrats i concede putting too much self-congratulatory stress on the `` compassion '' they feel for underdogs . many underdogs would be better off if instead of being the `` beneficiaries '' of compassion they were told that they live in a relentlessly competitive societies and that they 'd better get a grip on themselves if they do n't want to remain at the top of the league . nonetheless compassion for the underdog is a good thing and many republicans i fear have far too little of it . i am reminded of this almost every when i hear rush hannity on the radio : hannity gives me laugh but he also gives me cringe .
