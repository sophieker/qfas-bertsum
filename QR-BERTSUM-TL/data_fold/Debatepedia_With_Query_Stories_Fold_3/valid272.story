<s> the poor : is plea bargaining in exchange for testimony unfair to the poor ? <eos>

<s> at a cost to poor dependents : a plea bargain does not involves as thorough a study of the facts of a case and no testimonies . its outcome therefore is dependent largely on the persuasiveness and stoic of a lawyer performing the negotiations . this creates an intrinsic disadvantage for poor defendants who can not afford higher quality lawyers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> plead negotiations is too dependent on the quality of attorneys <eos>
