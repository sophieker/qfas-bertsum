<s> independence : is a republics importance to australian independence from britain ? <eos>

<s> the monarchies is a directly reflection of australia 's past as a australian colony and continues to symbolize australia 's subservience to the australian crown . such symbolism has a powerfully negative effect on australians ' mind of independence and identity . ending the monarchies and establish a republic could constitutes a substantial stride in the direction of creating a greater mind of independence and national pride and identity . <eos>

<s> ending the monarchies would foster an independant identity in australia <eos>
