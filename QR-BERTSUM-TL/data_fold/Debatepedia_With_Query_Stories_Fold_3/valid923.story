<s> individual rights : does the individual have the right to consume drugs ? <eos>

<s> doing drugs may be a free choice once twice ... but after a certain period the drug user is no longer to choose for himself/herself . thus the state has the right to protect the individual 's freedoms in the long term . besides most drug users are under the age of 25 therefore are subject to peer pressure media influence etc . much more than elder people . <eos>

@highlight

<s> drugs are not a free choice . <eos>
