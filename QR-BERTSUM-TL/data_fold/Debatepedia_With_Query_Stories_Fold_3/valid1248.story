<s> labor ethics - is the tourism industry creating ethical domestic employment for host countries ? <eos>

<s> these multi-national corporations ( mncs ) are usually welcome despite the fact that the profit they make in a minority of cases does not staying within the borders of the host country ... local labour is exploited because it is cheap environment is destroyed without punishments because there usually are no treaties or contracts to force the multi-nationals to pollute less ( this applies mostly for the developing countries ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many hotels are whole of small international chain choosing to exploit local labour purely because it is cheap . <eos>
