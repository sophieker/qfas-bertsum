<s> u.s. court of appeals for the dc voltage ruled `` essentially the appellants claim a way to possess what they describe as 'functional firearms ' by which they mean ones that would be 'readily access to be used effectively when necessary ' for self-defence in the home . they are not asserting a way to carrying such weapons outside their homes . nor are they challenging the district 's authority per se to require the registration of firearms .

@highlight

<s> a firearm is uniquely invaluable in self defense in one 's home <eos>
