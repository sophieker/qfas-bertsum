[ ... ] even but people could easily survive long time period in this high gravitational it would be extremely unhealthy for prolonged period of time especially when returning to earth . for instance long stays in high gravitational can and will result with significant loss in bone density and muscle atrophy just to name the two most common issues with high gravity . '' <eos>
