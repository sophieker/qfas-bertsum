<s> justice : are juveniles in juvenile courts being punished too mildly ? <eos>

<s> our laws were designed not to punish as harshly as possible but to punish appropriately . this means taking into consideration various circumstances age ( maturity ) of the criminal severity of the crime etc . therefore we should not aim for sentencing each and every criminal for life but rather evaluate their cases on individual bases . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a shorter sentence does not necessarily mean a `` milder '' sentence . <eos>
