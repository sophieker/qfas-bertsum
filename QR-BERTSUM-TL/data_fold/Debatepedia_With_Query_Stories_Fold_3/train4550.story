<s> economics : would a playoff be as economical ? <eos>

<s> daniel deceuster . `` the case for a college football playoff . '' bleacher report . march # # : `` think if usc and osu played in the rose bowl next season . each team would get a big cut of the revenues generated and a lot of money would go to their conferences the bcs and the television network broadcasting the game . [ ... ] now think if usc and osu are seeded # - # in the tournament and go all the way to the championship . each team would have played three home games to get there . [ ... ] think of how much revenue goes straight to the school much more than just the one rose bowl game that divides the revenue so many ways . '' <eos>
