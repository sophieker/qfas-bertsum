<s> sovereignty : do assassinations uphold the sovereignty in the international system ? <eos>

<s> sovereignty is not always inviolable . to the extent that a government acts wrongfully its legitimacy as the sovereign rulers of a state is diminished . a true despot may losing all legitimacy to govern his or her state through unjust acts . in such circumstances the sovereignty of the state ( which can only be held by a government or a tyrant ) is diminished and it becomes more legitimately to consider assassinations . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tyrants forgo sovereign liberties making assassinated attempts legitimately <eos>
