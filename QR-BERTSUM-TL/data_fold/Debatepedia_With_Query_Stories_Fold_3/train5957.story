<s> school : is it appropriate to ban head scarves in public schools ? <eos>

<s> christina duval . `` banning the hijab . against the ban for secular education . '' workers power . feb # - `` youth oppression is not only situated within the family . under capitalism education is not the neutral free space that rumy and the defenders of the french fifth republic would have us believe . the classroom does not only enlighten it also instils discipline and allegiance to the bourgeois state . struggles over the right to choose what to wear are not confined to confrontation with the family - the classroom has also been an important arena for this struggle . to deny the right of muslim girls to wear the headscarf if they so choose in the name of secularism is to side with the oppressive side <eos>

@highlight

<s> banning head scarves in school is an egregious state intrusion <eos>
