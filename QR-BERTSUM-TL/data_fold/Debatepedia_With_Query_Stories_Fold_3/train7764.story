<s> global law : can assassinations of tyrants be justification in global law ? <eos>

<s> despotism and oppression are obvious wherever they take place . it isn t just how democratic a regime is it is whether it uses its power to inflict great suffering upon its those or others against all human rights standards . if leaders guilty of genocide or other crime against humanity can be came to account through the normal democratic processes or the courts then fine . but if they can not then their those have the moral right to take up arms against them . often this will mean assassination . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if despots ca n't be came to judicial assassination is a good idea . <eos>
