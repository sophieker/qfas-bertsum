<s> aesthetics : are drilling rigs aesthetically tolerable ? <eos>

<s> while some contend that oil rigs are ugly to look at from the coast this is not necessarily the case for everyone . many like the imaginative stimulation it provides as it forces one to contemplate a rig drilling thousands of feet to a reservoir below and to contemplate the energy demands of modern society . this need not be a painful `` eye-sore '' and can often be quite pleasant . <eos>
