'' yahoo sports . june 13th 2010 : `` we should not impose western values on south africa . a ban would rob the tournament of part of its cultural identity leaving thousands of locals perplexed : could you imagine being told by an international body that you could no longer drink beer at american football games or fall asleep during baseball ? the south africans would n't take too kindly to having a national institution removed .
