<s> time : could the when consume by instantly replay be limited ? <eos>

<s> one option is to implement the nfl s red-flag systems which limits team to two replays per game . one is a broader option that allows operators in mlb s central replay office to stop the game to review a call . both of these systems would significantly limits the time consumed by a replay system . the maximum time added would be something think # minutes to a game in exceptional circumstances . this is but worth ensuring games are won fairly . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many replay system could adequately reduce time consumed . <eos>
