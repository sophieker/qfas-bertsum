<s> enforcement : is enforcing a ban feasible ? <eos>

<s> if non-muslims are forced to wearing the headscarf or other head-coverings in some muslims countries when they visit why is it that muslims women visit the west should be protected from nationalized the burqa/niqab in the west ? if the rule is that women must adopt the local custom then let that be the rule . <eos>

@highlight

<s> foreigners adopt local traditions in islamic countries ; same in west <eos>
