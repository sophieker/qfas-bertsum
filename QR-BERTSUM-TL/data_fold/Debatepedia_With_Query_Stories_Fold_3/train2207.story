<s> economy : would the universal languages be beneficial economically ? <eos>

<s> every benefits come with some sacrifices . if we do n't carrying out the `` global language '' just for the sake of the linguists and language teacher the world will never be able to develop . also good linguists and good language teacher are expect to be rather intelligent those they would arguably adapt quickly to some other activities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> universal language would remove cost of translations services . <eos>
