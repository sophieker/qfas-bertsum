<s> responsibility : are countries responsibility for historic debt ? <eos>

<s> in a number of poorer countries huge debts were amassed by the irresponsible spend of despots in the past who have now been overthrown ; yet the new government and the people of that country have to pay the prices for the dictator s actions . this is clearly unfair . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debt repayments often punish those not responsibility for creating debt . <eos>
