<s> utility in war : do land mines provide little military utility ? <eos>

<s> without landmines a country may feel it is necessary to expand the size of its army in order to protect its borders and people . this can become very costly for a nation . and once an army is up and running the country may get the idea why not use it ? . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nations will have to develop larger armies if they ca n't deploy landmines . <eos>
