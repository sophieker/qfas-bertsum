<s> not torture ? is it wrong to calling water-boarding torture ? <eos>

<s> -- waterboarding seems to match the definition of the # bybee memo in which assistant aj jay bybee defined tortures as `` physical pain amounting to tortures must be equivalents in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of physical function or even death '' . waterboarding certainly fits the criteria of `` impairment of physical function '' last breathing can obviously be considered a major `` bodily function '' . also because lungs are organs filling them with water does meet the criteria of inducing `` organ failure '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> waterboarding even fits the meehan memo definition of torture <eos>
