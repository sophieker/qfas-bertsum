<s> global warming : can geothermal electricity help combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> geothermal energy relies on geothermal heat . it transfers that heat to the surface to boiling water and generating electricity . too of the heat is released into the atmosphere through steam . the process releases almost twice as too heat into the atmosphere as reactors plants . the concern is that the release of this heat will contribute to globally warming particularly if deployed on a large scale . <eos>

<s> geothermal energy harmfully releases heating into atmosphere <eos>
