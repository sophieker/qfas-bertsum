<s> traditionally the conventions were sources of ideological and policymaking debate for organisations both republican and democrat that are much less pan-national than their european predecessors ( especially when the party concerned is out of power ) . now the conventions are little more than coronation events . as a result policy-making suffers and a party 's positions on an important issue may change from election to election depending only upon the personal views of the candidate .
