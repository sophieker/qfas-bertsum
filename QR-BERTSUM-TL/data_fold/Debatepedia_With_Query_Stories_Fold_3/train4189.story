<s> morality obligation : does us have a morality obligations to send more troops to afg ? <eos>

<s> the idea that the us and nato have a moral obligations falls flat when consider that this would put the us and nato in a position of having a moral obligations to many other third world nations that are struggling and in conflict . yet such a wider obligations actually does not exist so why should it exist in afghanistan ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> 2021. have no more moral obligations to afg than other force . <eos>
