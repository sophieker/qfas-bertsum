<s> religion : is turkey a secular country ? does religion have a role in this debate ? <eos>

<s> the new justice and development party ( ak ) government is not seeking to overturn the secular constitution although it does want to amend some laws that positively discriminate against devout muslims . these include rules such as the ban on women wearing headscarves in government buildings ; restrictions on expressing religious belief which would break human rights laws within the eu ! in any case millions of muslims already live within the eu ; excluding turkey from membership on the grounds of religion would suggest these european muslims were second-class citizens in a christian club . it would also presumably rule out future eu entry for albania bosnia and kosovo . the eu should welcome a state which could provide a positive example of how islam is <eos>

@highlight

<s> turkey is a fully secular state with a predominantly muslim population . <eos>
