<s> muddy slope : does criminalizing of holocaust denial open muddy slope to other bans ? <eos>

<s> the holocaust is currently uniquely in term of the certainty that it happened its scale and its effect on current politics ( i.e . the rise of the far right ) . criminalize it therefore does not risk opening a slippery slope to curtailing the exercise of free speech in other instances of a much lesser notability and degree of importance historically and in contemporary politics . <eos>

@highlight

<s> holocaust denial is a unique exception to free speech . <eos>
