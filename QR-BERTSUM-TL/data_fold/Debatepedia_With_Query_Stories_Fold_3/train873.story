<s> power abuse : can adult family members engage in sexual activity from a position of equal power ? <eos>

<s> those most likely to take up the opportunities offered by this change in the law live in remote isolated places where abuse is even more likely to be successfully concealed . the recent case of repeated sexual abuse on the island of pitcairn demonstrates the dangers of small societies determining their own moral agenda . this kind of abuse becomes much more likely when the state sanctions some of the acts concerned as the argument becomes about lack of consent which is much more difficult to prove than about incest itself . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legalizing incest increases the risks of abuse . <eos>
