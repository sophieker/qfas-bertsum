<s> proportionality : were israel strikes proportional to the hamas attacks ? <eos>

<s> hezbollah has stated that its objective is to destroy israel . such an existential threat goes far merely hamas ' rocket attacks as it portends much more destructive attacks in the future . this justifies defensive attacks from israel that go far responding simply to the hezbollah rockets and even justifies israeli efforts to fully demobilize or destroy hamas . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gaza assaults rightfully preempts hamas ' existential threats to israel <eos>
