<s> enforcement : is a ban on landmines enforceable over time ? <eos>

<s> it only stops nations that obey the law from using landmines . most nations contemplating invasion will ignore it deploying them aggressively to defend captured territory . on the other hands many nations that could use landmines defensively for themselves or for multinational defense of another vulnerable nation or people will observe the bans and thus weaken themselves and expose those they guard . the landmine should in fact be a primary tool of the united nations efforts to protect those in its care . nations that want to use landmines will do so regardless of the position taken by the usa ( or any other nation ) - as demonstrated by the previous prolific use of mines spite the mass of signatories to the ottawa <eos>

@highlight

<s> the bans has an asymmetric effect . <eos>
