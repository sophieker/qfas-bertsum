<s> worker 's rights : does efca strengthen worker 's rights ? <eos>

<s> rep. john kline ( r-minn. ) an opponent of the bill stated `` it is beyond me how one can possibly claim that a system whereby everyone your employer your union organizer and your co-workers knows exactly how you vote on the issue of unionization gives an employee 'free choice ... it seems pretty clear to me that the only way to ensure that a worker is 'free to choose ' is to ensure that there 's a private ballot so that no one knows how you voted . i can not fathom how we were about to sit there today and debate a proposal to take away a worker 's democratic right to vote in a secret-ballot election and call it 'employee free choice . ' '' [ # ] <eos>
