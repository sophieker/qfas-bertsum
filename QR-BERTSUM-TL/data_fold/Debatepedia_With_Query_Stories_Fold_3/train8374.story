<s> religion institutions : are religion institutions generally harmful ? <eos>

<s> which it unquestionally did with regard to the holocaust ignores the fact that the minority of nazis were catholics that the catholic church collaborated with the nazi state to the extent of organising the escape of defeated nazis to south america that hitler and the nazis regularly ( even if they did not actually honestly believe it themselves ) claimed that they were acted in accordance with god 's will and with his blessing - the belt worn by non-ss soldiers had upon it `` gott mit uns '' ( `` god with us '' ) and those senior nazis endorsed some form of paganism . the nazi government nor blanket endorsed or repressed religion both according to personal belief and political expediency . it was certainly not an athiestic government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the claim that the nazi governments was repressive of religion <eos>
