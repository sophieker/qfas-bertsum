<s> economics : is government ownership of water utilities economically efficient ? <eos>

<s> rich consumers in the developed world also waste water through extravagant use of luxuries such as garden sprinklers swimming pools lush golf courses etc . - a problem which will get worse as income inequality increases both between and within countries . demand management is needed to prevent waste and to ensure access for all including the poor something which pricing water in a purely economic way will not achieve . this is a job for governments accountable to their people not for private companies .

@highlight

<s> demand for water increases with population growth so it does not respond to market signals in the way other resources <eos>
