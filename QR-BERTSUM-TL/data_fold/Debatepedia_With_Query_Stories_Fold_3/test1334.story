<s> choice : do vouchers introduce beneficial choice to education ? <eos>

<s> vouchers do not provide all public school students with a choice to attend private schools . private schools can inherently deny applicants entry . the main problem with this is that many of the most needy disadvantaged groups are already being turned away by private schools so education vouchers may not provide them with any greater choice or access to private schools . public schools are open to all students and this is why the disadvantaged should be helped through the public school system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor often ca n't afford private schools even with vouchers <eos>
