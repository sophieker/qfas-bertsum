<s> irony : are developed state more obligation because poorer state are harmed most ? <eos>

<s> developed nations were not even concerned of the consequences of their emissions through most of the industrial revolution . therefore they were certainly not concerned that the consequences would disproportionately falling on poor developing nations . developed nations are not therefore responsible or culpable for these disproportionate consequences so they should not be disproportionately obligated to fight globally climate change on this point . <eos>

@highlight

<s> develop did not plan for emissions to harm bad most . <eos>
