<s> obama 's race : is it inconsequential that obama would be the first black president ? <eos>

<s> that obama is white has no bearing on his policies . it is neither an advantages nor a disadvantage . it should not be raised thus as something that will obviously promote racial equality by breaking historical barriers . to do so probably does more of a disservice to racial equality than anything else . <eos>

@highlight

<s> being white wo n't changing policies . <eos>
