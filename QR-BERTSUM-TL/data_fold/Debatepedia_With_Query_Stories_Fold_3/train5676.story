<s> crisis : which is the greater crisis inequality or warming change ? <eos>

<s> if climate change occurs in complete agricultural industries for example that rely on certain climates will be destroyed . if the temperature change does not do this the subsequent spread of new pests or diseases will present equally devastating risks to crops . this would reduce economic production as well as the provision of healthy foods subsequently worsening poverty and human suffering . decreased prevalence of drought particularly in the north and the depleting of water resource would have a particularly negative impact on poverty malnutrition and famine . for these reason fighting climate change is a priority in fighting poverty and should thus not be definition beneath poverty-reduction . this will happen in all societies around the world not just in the global south . <eos>

@highlight

<s> warming change should be addressed or poverty will worsen <eos>
