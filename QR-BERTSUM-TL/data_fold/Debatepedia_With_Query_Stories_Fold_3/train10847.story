<s> emeritus professor gordon grigg - university of queensland . `` kangaroos on defence lands - one view '' . march # th # : `` darting followed by lethal injection sounds simple and humane and is probably a good options for small numbers of animals . for animals at low density because you have to be close to shoot the dart and because it takes time for a dart to take effects the proximity of the shooters and the odd behavior of the darted individual all contribute to a stressful situation for the other kangaroos which will hop about frantically in great distress . '' <eos>
