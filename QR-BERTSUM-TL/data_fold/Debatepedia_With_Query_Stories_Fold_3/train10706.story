<s> economics : is solar energy economically sound ? <eos>

<s> because solar powers is very inconsistent it should be managed heavily . someone has to constantly monitor solar energy 's production engaging back-up sources when supply is low and stored energy when supply is high . this is inefficient and costly . and whenever solar powers is built an auxiliary source of powers should be built as well . this is costly . <eos>
