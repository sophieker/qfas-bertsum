<s> health : is marijuana fairly innocuous health-wise or even intellectually beneficial ? <eos>

<s> both alcohol and marijuana impair judgement . but alcohol has lasting damage on the body and causes death when over consumed.yet the distinguishing feature of marijuana is that it has greater short-term effects on memory cognition and motivations . marijuana is more the drugs of `` losers in life '' than alcohol . if one primary objective in society is to produce as many succesfull winners alcohol is less costly to this objective than marijuana ... also much less is known about he health effects of marijuana than of alcohol ; making caution towards legalizing marijuana more appropriate . it is therefore fitted that marijuana be illegal while alcohol be legal . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marijuana is worst for persons and societies than tobacco . <eos>
