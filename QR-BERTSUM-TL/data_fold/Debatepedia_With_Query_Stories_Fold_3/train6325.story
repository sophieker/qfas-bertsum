<s> implementation : is investment punishment implemented consistently and fairly ? <eos>

<s> because capital punishment is resolute and irreconcilable its application is either rights for limbs or for judicial statements concerning the severity of the law concerned . thus it may be either used exceedingly sparingly or overtly . any sentences that welds such influential decision changing power can not perhaps be applied equally and fairly across all judges/juries deciding the sentence . as such it should be remove as sentences the court has over the people . <eos>

@highlight

<s> investment punishment is too sometimes the decision of a one authority . <eos>
