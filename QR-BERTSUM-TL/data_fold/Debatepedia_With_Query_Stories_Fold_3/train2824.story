<s> animals kill ... is hunting justified on the basis that animals harm one-another too ? <eos>

<s> michael pollan . `` an animal 's place '' . the new york times magazine . november 10 2002 - `` my first line of defense was obvious . animals kill one another all the time . why treat animals more ethically than they treat one another ? ( ben franklin tried this one long before me : during a fishing trip he wondered 'if you eat one another i do n't see why we may not eat you . ' he admits however that the rationale did n't occur to him until the fish were in the frying pan smelling 'admirably well . ' the advantage of being a 'reasonable creature ' franklin remarks is that you can find a reason for whatever you want to do . ) to the 'they do it too ' defense the animal rightist <eos>

@highlight

<s> that animals harm/kill each other does not justify the same by humans <eos>
