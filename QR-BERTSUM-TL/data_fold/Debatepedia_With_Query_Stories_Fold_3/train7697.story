<s> `` success '' : is `` success '' in iraq difficult make withdrawal necessary ? <eos>

<s> at every stage of the war in iraq from # through # `` changes of strategy '' have been held out as the kernel of hope toward achieving `` success '' `` just around the corner '' . each time although `` changing '' the strategies has failed to bring coalition forces noticeably closer to `` success '' in iraq . things have rather steadily worsened . new claims that `` strategic changes '' will `` this time '' make the difference no longer have any credibility and need to be shut out on this basis . the main problem is that no strategic change can alter the fundamentals of the conflict ( below ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is not credible anymore to claims that success is possible `` this time '' <eos>
