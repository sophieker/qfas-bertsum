<s> iran problem : is new start key to addressing iran problem ? <eos>

<s> peter brookes . `` not a new start but a bad start . '' the hill . september 13th 2010 : `` drawing down us will a u.s. drawdown undermine american strategic deterrence a bedrock of our defense policy in the nuclear age encouraging other potential rivals to bolster their current or future arsenals ? and in a world that is arming not disarming could these major reductions in our nuclear force create ( or feed ) an image of american weakness and decline leading to misperception and miscalculation and conflict ? obama sees it differently believing u.s. leadership on disarmament ( even unilateral ) gives us greater moral standing in battling proliferation . but will others follow ? looking around the world there s no evidence of 'denuclearization discipleship ' so far . '' <eos>
