<s> declan mccullagh . `` should you be taxed to subsidize 'the new york times ' ? '' . cnet . september # # -- `` i 'm not sure what 's going to happen to newspapers in their current form but i am optimistic about the future of journalism . my own employer cnet networks has found a way to making money by publishing news and reviews without collecting taxpayer handouts . if readers ( or viewers ) continue to need classic reporting and i believe they will news organizations will find a way to meet that market demand . without a taxpayer bailout newspapers may not look exactly like they do today but journalism itself will remain alive and well .
