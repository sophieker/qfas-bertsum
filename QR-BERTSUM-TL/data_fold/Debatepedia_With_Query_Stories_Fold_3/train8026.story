<s> protecting non-smokers : is a ban necessary to protect non-smokers ? <eos>

<s> there are plenty of places ware there is no smoking allowed especially lately . you ca n't smoke at work you cant smoke in bars and so it is getting harder and harder to find places to smoke in public . so i do n't see why people are putting up a big fuss about the whole thing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if you dont like smoking or smokers then just leave . <eos>
