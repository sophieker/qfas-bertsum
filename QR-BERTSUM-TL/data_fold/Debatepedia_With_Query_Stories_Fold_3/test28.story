<s> social : would legalization entail heavy socio-economic costs ? <eos>

<s> presently cannabis is sold by dealers who have connections with the underworld . the legalization of cannabis will help facilitate the sale of the drug in establishments like amsterdam s `` coffee houses '' . this will shift the sale of cannabis away from the criminal underworld . the severance of this criminal link will ensure that the users of the drug no longer want to come into contact with organised crime . <eos>

@highlight

<s> illegal marijuana forces consumers to interact with crimes underground <eos>
