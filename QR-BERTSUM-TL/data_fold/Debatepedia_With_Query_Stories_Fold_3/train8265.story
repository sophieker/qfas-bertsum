<s> woman 's rights : does a lady have a right to her body that includes a right to abortion ? <eos>

<s> if one does not need to have a baby they should not have sex or they should take extreme precaution when having sex . sex is not a game . it is a serious matter of reproduction and life . if a woman plays with it and become pregnant she should be held responsible to carrying out the birth of her child . and it should be noted that the responsibility could ends at child-birth with it being possible to put a child up for adoption . the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy need not be major but they must be born by the mother and father . <eos>

@highlight

<s> women should be holding responsible for behavior lead to impregnation . <eos>
