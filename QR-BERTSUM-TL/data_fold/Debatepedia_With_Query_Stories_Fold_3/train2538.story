<s> dr. rick fitzgibbons of catholic medical association 7/20/05 - `` the peer-reviewed literature demonstrates that an inability to maintain committed relationships and rampant promiscuity are the norm in the homosexual lifestyle . to illustrate this one recent study in amsterdam by xiridou demonstrated that 86 % of the new cases of aids came from those in committed relationships and that those in casual relationships averaged between 16-28 sexual partners per year . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the homosexual culture displays `` rampant promiscuity '' and immorality . <eos>
