<s> responsible marketplace : can the market be regulated properly ? <eos>

<s> the donor of an organ or his family will stand to benefit considerably from the sale . but even the most impoverished individual will not choose to donating their heart or pulmonary and thus die . neither would a surgeon be prepared to conduct such an operation . but both a kidney and a piece of liver can be remove without substantial detriment . it is patronising to considering that the individual can not make a reasoned decision to donating or sell these organs . the family of a relative recently deceased ought also to be able to choose to save the life of another and simultaneously receiving some remuneration . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> persons and family should be trusted to act rationally in the sale of organs . <eos>
