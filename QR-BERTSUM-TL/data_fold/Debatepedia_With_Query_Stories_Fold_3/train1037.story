<s> us law : are voting rights for prisoners supported by us law ? <eos>

<s> it is common fact among government that the right to vote belongs to all legal aged citizens . while the opposing sides be arguing that criminals are not citizens one should remember that we continue to give them the right to an attorney and other such obvious inalienable rights . by doing this we recognize they are but citizens . and citizens have the right to vote . <eos>

<s> prisoners are but citizens . <eos>
