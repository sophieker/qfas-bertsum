<s> other states : is the dc handgun ban consistently with other states regulation ? <eos>

<s> starting from early # s initiatives for handgun bans began to be struck down as people opposed them higher-risk the # s all guns ban laws were struck down even in very leftist conceils comes to show that history proves the reluctance of people in the us to give up their rights of guns ownership for a public greater safe goal . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gun prohibition movement has traditionally failed in the u.s <eos>
