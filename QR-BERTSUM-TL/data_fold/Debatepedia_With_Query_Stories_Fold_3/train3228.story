<s> assisting quiting : would a ban help smokers quit ? <eos>

<s> many groups argue that a government should not try and shape the social choices of its citizens toward desired social ends ; people should be as free as possible to do what they want as long as their actions do n't violate the liberties of others . in this framework governments should not intervene in the personal choice of a citizen to smoke - through a public places smoking ban - for any expressed purpose of affecting a `` positive '' change in that citizen 's personal choices . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the government should n't play the role of big brother with a smoking ban . <eos>
