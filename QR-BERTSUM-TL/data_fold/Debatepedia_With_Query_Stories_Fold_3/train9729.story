<s> aborigines : would a cull be consistent with aboriginal interests ? <eos>

<s> kangaroos are native to ausralia and special to aborigines . aboriginal australians are totally opposed to the cull and have protested to the point that they are camping on the proposed culling site . aboriginals can not take a loss like this and really europeans invaded their lands and now they are try to kill the animals native to aboriginal country . that is not the way black australians should respect the those who lands they took over . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marsupials have been part of aborigines cultures for millenia . <eos>
