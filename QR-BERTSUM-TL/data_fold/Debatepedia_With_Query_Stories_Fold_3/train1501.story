<s> equality : do civil unions offer sufficient equality to gays ? <eos>

<s> the idea that opening civil unions to straights solves the problem of civil unions be `` separate but unequal '' fails a very simple test . while heterosexuals may have equal access to civil unions do gays have equal access to marriage ? no . clearly therefore allowing straights to participate in civil unions while continuing to deny gays the right to marry does not nullify the argument that civil unions are akin to `` separate but equal '' and actually unequal . <eos>

@highlight

<s> civil unions still `` separate but equal '' if straights can do it . <eos>
