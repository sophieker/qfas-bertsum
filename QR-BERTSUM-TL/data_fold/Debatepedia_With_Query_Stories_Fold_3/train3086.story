<s> disadvantaged : do recruiters target disadvantaged students ? <eos>

<s> there is evidence from both the uk and the usa that military recruiters target disadvantaged areas . they seem to think that poorer students will have few other career options so they will be more likely to join up . it isn t right that young people from poor backgrounds can be exploited in this way . why should they be expected to risk their lives much more than students from better-off areas ? instead schools and governments should make sure all students get equal chances in life . <eos>

@highlight

<s> military wrongly targets disadvantaged communities . <eos>
