<s> exploitation : does abortion protect or expose women to sexist/sexual exploitation ? <eos>

<s> there is a strange double standard being applied by opponents of abortion . the dignity of the fetus is glorified while the dignity of the child-rearer is seemingly ignored and even trampled . this is particularly regarding when more men appear to support abortion than woman ; it appear that men are more willing to trample the child-bearer ( a woman ) than the child . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is strange to defend the self-respect of a foetus over a child-rearer <eos>
