<s> school : is it appropriate to ban head scarves in private schools ? <eos>

<s> `` banning the hijab '' . workers power . nov # - `` my starting point is that secularism is a fundamental pillar of communist politics and therefore communist organisation must have this at the heart of their programmes and campaigns . this necessitates the demand for the complete separation of the state from religion which implies that state educational must be rigorously secular ( this is not to suggest that there should be a complete absence of religion from the curriculum ; on the contrary aspects of all the world 's major religions should be taught - but not dogmatic religious teach and ritual and certainly no privilege accorded to christianity - as well as critique of religion and the irreconcilability of religious 'truths ' with science ) .
