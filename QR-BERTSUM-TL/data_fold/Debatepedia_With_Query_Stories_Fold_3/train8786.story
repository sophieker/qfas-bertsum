<s> sterilization : is sterilization of kangaroos an inadequate alternative ? <eos>

<s> emeritus professor gordon grigg - university of queensland . `` kangaroos on defence lands - another view '' . march # th # - `` sterilisation has also been suggested and that is worth considering proactively when a population is small in order to heads off the problem before it arises . sterilisation is a waste of time once the population is large enough to be causing land degradation because the sterilised individuals will still be there continuing to feed for years to come . possibly some selective sterilisation would be worth considering in canberra after the culling has reduced the numbers sufficiently . '' without culling sterilization is ineffectual to help prevent the problem kangaroos pose in australia . <eos>

<s> sterilisation is not an effective response to kangaroos overpopulation <eos>
