<s> paul tetlock jason burnett and robert hahn . `` ban cells phones in cars ? '' . cato.org . december # # -- `` a prudent regard for safety does n't imply cells phones should be banned . americans are willing to tolerate some # # annually deaths from car accidents . if we wish to decisively curtailing automobile deaths the national speed limit should be set at # miles per hour and vigorously enforced -- yet we 're not willing to do that because that inconvenience outweighs the pleasure and efficiencies of being able to get places quickly .
