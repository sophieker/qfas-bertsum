<s> do the regulations work to stop terrorism ? <eos>

<s> the regulations on what can be taken onboard aircraft are not what stops terrorism . all terrorist attacks since the laws have been in place have been avoided not by these rules but before the attempted terrorists boarded the planes . these regulations do not do anything except annoy innocent passengers and do not help out the fight against terrorism nor have they stopped any terrorist attacks - the regulations are not what avoids terrorism . <eos>

@highlight

<s> since these rules have been in place all attempted terrorist attacks have been stopped before they happened . <eos>
