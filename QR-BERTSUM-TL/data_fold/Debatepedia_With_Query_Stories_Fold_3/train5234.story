<s> economics : are education vouchers economical efficient ? <eos>

<s> private sector schools require extra funds as the profit motive has to be met . they are therefore not necessarily cheaper for the taxpayer . vouchers that go toward private schools may therefore simply go toward lining the pockets of the investors of private schools . this is neither a fair nor an efficient use of taxpayer money . <eos>
