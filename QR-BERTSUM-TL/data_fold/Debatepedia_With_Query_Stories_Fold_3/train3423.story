<s> democracy : will a withdrawal be better for democratic in the world ? <eos>

<s> the domino theory depends on the premise that if the us withdraws iraq will turn into an islamist country which will then cause other countries to become becoming islamist . but it is a highly questionable notion that iraq would turn into an islamist country after a us withdrawal . this depends on iraq first turning into a failed states and its democracy government crumbling which is questionable and then islamist becoming the dominant political force in the country such that it would influence other countries to adopting islamist which are which both highly questionable premises . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the domino theory relies on a highly questionable notions of iraq turning islamist . <eos>
