<s> grow government : does us stimulus right/wrongly grow government ? <eos>

<s> the idea that government is `` bad '' and that any growth in government engender by the bailout is subsequently `` bad '' is false . government governs for the people and by the people . unless one argues that the people are bad government must be good . see government is good.com for an expansion on this argument . <eos>

@highlight

<s> government is good ; grow government with stimulus is not bad . <eos>
