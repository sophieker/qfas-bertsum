<s> judicial in representation . economic equity is often used to argue against progressives taxation on the grounds of representation being out-of-proportion to taxation : while the bottom # % in income in most countries pay over half the taxes [ # ] they only have # % of the voting weight . this argument can be reversal into the kleptocratic cases that if tax is to be progressives it should be accompanied by greater say in elections for those who contribute most . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the wealthy pay more taxes but are n't same more voting power . <eos>
