<s> teach the controversy : should the controversy be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> the idea that creationists reject mutation or naturally selection is ridiculous . these are observable facts . what creationists defending is the idea that these changes can not create new habitat and as a resulting a design a fashion and a creator is necessary . furthermore if schools do not teach competing theories it is comparable to teaching there is no alien life . this can not be proven or demonstrated however it would seem that if that fit in with their theory for the rest of biochemistry the evolutionists would teach it without question . <eos>

@highlight

<s> school should taught competing theory <eos>
