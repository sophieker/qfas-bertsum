<s> politics : does ( and should ) the vox populi matter ? <eos>

<s> according to fareed zakaria ( the future of freedom : illiberal democracy home and abroad ) especially less developed countries encounter problems when implementing basic democratic principles as majorities are able to systematically undermine the whole legal system as well as the protection of human rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> democracy can easily result in a `` tyranny of the majority '' . <eos>
