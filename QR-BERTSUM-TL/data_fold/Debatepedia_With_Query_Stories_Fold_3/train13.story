<s> peer review : is wikipedia perhaps better off without a formal peer-reviewed process ? <eos>

<s> at the moment it is completely in the hand of an individuals if he thinks a modification he intends is an improvement so there comes a point when a modification is as likely to damage the resource . if some system could be installed then you could protecting against crank attacks as well as misjudgment and ensuring a continually improving resource . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wiki should have a peer reviews process before edits are accepted <eos>
