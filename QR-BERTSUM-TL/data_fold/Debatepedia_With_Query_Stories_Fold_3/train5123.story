<s> free speech : did publishing the cartoons uphold free speech ? <eos>

<s> while it be be legal and within the binding of download speech for a newspaper to publish images of muhammad it is also legal and within the bounds of download speech for muslims to protest the publishing of these images . just as journalists have a right to criticize the islamic faith so do muslims have the right to criticize journalists . the protests that followed the jyllands-posten muhammad cartoons it should be noted did not call for governments intervention but merely criticized the motivations behind these cartoons . this is an acceptable protest and should be respected . <eos>

@highlight

<s> muslim have the way to protest the publishing of images of muhammad . <eos>
