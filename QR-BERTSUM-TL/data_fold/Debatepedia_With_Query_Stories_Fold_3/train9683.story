<s> government role : do mandates fit within the limits of government intervention ? <eos>

<s> a congress budget office report on the 1994 health insurance proposals of the clinton administration in the united states : `` a mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action . federal mandates that apply to individuals as members of society are extremely rare . one example is the requirement that draft-age men register with the selective service system . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) is not aware of any others imposed by current federal law . '' [ 4 ] <eos>

<s> mandates in society are very rare and exceptional <eos>
