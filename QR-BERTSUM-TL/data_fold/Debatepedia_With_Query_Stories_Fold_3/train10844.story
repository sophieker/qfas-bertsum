<s> jobs : does mountaintop removal cost/create jobs ? <eos>

<s> ashley judd . `` stop mountain top removal coal mining . '' the hill . july # th # : `` coal companies say appalachia needs mining for jobs . again false . coal mining jobs in appalachia have decreased by # percent as mtr is highly mechanized . explosives machines such as # story draglines and bulldozers have replaced more than # # jobs . those working mtr jobs have little to no social protections and often work in a climate of bullying and fear . many sites lack regulation oversight and enforcement as recent tragedies make sadly clear . the specious argument that appalachia must choose between jobs and people jobs and ancient mountains honoring our coal mining past and having a strong future must be retired .
