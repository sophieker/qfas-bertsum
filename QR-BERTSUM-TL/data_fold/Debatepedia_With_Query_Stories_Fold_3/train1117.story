<s> sovereignty : should states have sovereign control over their water resources ? <eos>

<s> - failed states are often incapable of managing their own resources and therefore foster conditions that degrade human rights . if we consider water a human right than poor water management by failed states could justify an international intervention to protect these human rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a global water commons would address the mismanagement of water resources by failed states <eos>
