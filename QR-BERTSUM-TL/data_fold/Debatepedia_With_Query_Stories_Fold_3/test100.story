<s> sovereignty : do assassinations upholding the sovereignty in the international system ? <eos>

<s> sovereignty is not always inviolable . to the extent that a government acts wrongfully its legitimacy as the sovereign rulers of a state is diminished . a truth tyrant be lose all legitimacy to govern his or her state through unjust acts . in such circumstances the sovereignty of the state ( which can only be held by a government or a tyrant ) is diminished and it become more legitimate to consider assassinations . <eos>

<s> tyrants forgo sovereign rights making assassination attempt legitimate <eos>
