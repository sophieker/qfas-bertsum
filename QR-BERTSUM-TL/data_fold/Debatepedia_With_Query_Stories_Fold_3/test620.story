<s> independant identity ? do the scottish have an independant identity ? <eos>

<s> many of the differences between scotland and england are typical of any nation in the worlds with the exception of the smallest i.e . it is not unusual for parts of countries to have strong regional identities . this is true even for the various regions in england itself ( e.g . uk newcastle etc. ) . these differences on the whole are unlikely to lead to the fragmentation of the uk and will instead serving to strengthen the fabric of british society which is becoming increasingly multi-racial anyway . <eos>

@highlight

<s> argument that many countries in the world have strong national differences that have not justification separatism : <eos>
