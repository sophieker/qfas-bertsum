<s> rights : is the libertarian perspective on individuals rights appropriate ? <eos>

<s> if an individual wants to live in the forest in complete seclusion and without any interaction with other humans humans should n't he be allowed to do so ? why should other people and governments have binding liberties over that individual ? this is the reality in modernity and contradicts our naturally state as fully independent and self-sustaining creatures . <eos>

@highlight

<s> individuals have a way to own themselves with full independence . <eos>
