<s> renewable : is geothermal a `` renewable '' resource ? <eos>

<s> geothermal is a renewable energy resource . it derives energy from the heat of the earth 's core and volcanic-thermal activity . the earth 's core will continue to producing huge amounts of heat for millions of years . humans can tap this energy by pumping out super-hot water heating thousands of feet inside the earth 's crust . this supply of super-hot water will ever run out as long as it is managed properly allowing it to be sufficiently replenished by rain-water draining back into the earth 's crust . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hydropower energy is a renewables resource when manage properly . <eos>
