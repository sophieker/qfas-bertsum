<s> japan 's case : is japan exceptional in the way that it committing atrocities ? <eos>

<s> that has not been the case with other countries that have committing atrocity such as cambodia : if it did perhaps they would have this restriction too . such a restriction not current elsewhere is hardly an argument for abandoning it where it does exist . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the constitutional restriction springs from the circumstances that lead to the governance of japan being administer by eastern powers . <eos>
