<s> socialized medicine : is it wrong to call single-payer system socialized medicine ? <eos>

<s> most single-payer systems in europe as well as ones proposed in the united state ( building on medicare ) involve the government paying for the insurances of individuals . this means that individuals would still go to private hospitals and doctors . the only difference is that the government-funded insurances pays for services instead of the money coming from your own insurances company . <eos>
