<s> fetus rights : is it wrong to assigning rights to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> judith jarvis thomson . `` a defense of abortion '' . philosophy & private affairs vol . # no . # ( fall # ) . - `` most opposition to abortions relies on the premise that the fetus is a human being a person from the moments of conception . the premise is argued for but as i think not well . taking for example the most common argument . we are asked to notice that the development of a human being from conception through pregnancy into childhood is continuous ; then it is said that to draw a line to choose a point in this development and say `` before this point the really is not a person after this point it is a person '' is to make an arbitrarily choice a choice <eos>

<s> a foetus is no more a human than an acorns is a trees <eos>
