<s> the portugal treaty does not add sweeping new power to the eu over national governments . rather it clarifies existing power and responsibilities and streamlines the relations between the eu and national government so that they can work more effectively . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lisbon treaty reforms the eu ; it does not give it broad new powers <eos>
