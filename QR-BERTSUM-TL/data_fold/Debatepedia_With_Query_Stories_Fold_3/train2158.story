<s> rights : do animal have no rights protecting them from hunting ? <eos>

<s> this is frequent argument of animal rights activists ; that animal deserve rights because they have at least as much capacities to fact as do some retarded humans who retain rights . the problem with this argument is that it fails to see rights as a thing that must be shared amongst a group of creatures not something that is extended on an individual basis . therefore the questions is not whether some humans are incapable of having rights but rather whether human kind as a species is capable of having rights . they are . non-human animal conversely as a class of organisms are not capable of holding rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> that the dumb have liberties does not justify animals liberties <eos>
