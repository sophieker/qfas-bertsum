<s> economics : is government ownership of water utilities economically efficient ? <eos>

<s> on a domestic level unmetered access to water means that consumers do not pay according to the quantity they use and so they will use it wastefully . at a national level subsidized water for farmers and industry encourages wasteful methods and inappropriate crops ( e.g . growing water-hungry cotton in california or central asia both naturally areas of semi-desert ) often with a damaging impact upon the environment . pricing water according to its true cost would promote more efficient and environmentally-friendly practices e.g . the use of drip-irrigation or dry farming in agriculture .
