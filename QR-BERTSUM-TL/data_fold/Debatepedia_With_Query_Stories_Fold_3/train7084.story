<s> family integrity : does human cloning harm the integrity of the family ? <eos>

<s> society freely allows single people to reproduce sexually whether by accident or design . existing lawful practices such as sperm donation allow deliberate procreation without knowledge of the identity of the father . surely it is preferable for a mother to know the genetic heritage of her offspring rather than accept sperm from an unknown and random donor ? moreover reproductive cloning will allow lesbian couples to have children genetically related to them both . it might be better for the welfare of the child for it to be born into a happy relationship but the high rates of single parenthood and divorce suggest that this is not always possible . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the `` family integrity '' argument is wholly unsuited to the modern age . <eos>
