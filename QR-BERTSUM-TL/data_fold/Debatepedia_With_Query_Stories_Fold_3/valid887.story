<s> enforcement : is a ban on landmines unenforceable over time ? <eos>

<s> it is obviously true that only those nations that obey law will obey the law . that is a rationale for never passing any law . there will certainly be some nations that seek to ignore the ban but as it gain stature and is embedded in the worlds s view as a cement rule that should never be broken such nations will eventually come around especially if the diplomatic and moral might of the united states is seen to be behind the ban . for examples foreign officer trained at us military colleges will increasingly view the use of mines as unacceptable . even if they do not at least usage will have been vastly reduced by all those nations that do obey <eos>

@highlight

<s> a ban can be enforce gradually over time . <eos>
