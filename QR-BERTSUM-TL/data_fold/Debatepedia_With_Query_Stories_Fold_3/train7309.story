'' winning thesis of the # secretary of defense national security thesis competition : `` if the ban is lifted basic respect of privacy will be required just as when women were fully integrated into the services . previously the civilian discovered a lack of sexual privacy as well as sex between male and females undermined order discipline and morale. # dorm and facilities upgrades will no doubt be required . sexual harassment regulations and sensitivity training would want to be updated and guidance from leadership would be necessary . these would not be insurmountable obstacles . '' <eos>
