<s> do the requirements work to stop terrorism ? <eos>

<s> the regulations on what can be taken onboard aircraft are not what stops terrorism . all terrorist attack since the laws have been in place have been avoiding not by these rules but before the attempting terrorist boarded the planes . these regulations do not do anything except annoy innocent passengers and do not helping out the fight against terrorism nor have they started any terrorist attack -- the regulations are not what avoids terrorism . <eos>

@highlight

<s> last these rules have been in place all attempted terrorists attacks have been stopped before they happened . <eos>
