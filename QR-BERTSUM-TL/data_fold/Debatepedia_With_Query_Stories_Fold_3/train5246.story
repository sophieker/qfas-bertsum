<s> famine : is vegetarians advantageous to the global fight against famine ? <eos>

<s> there is enough food in the world . the problems is that it can not be easily distributed to remote area internationally . thus an individual living in an industrial society who opts to adopt a vegetarian diet will unlikely free-up food that can then be distributed to remote area in the worlds afflicted by famine . <eos>

@highlight

<s> famine is not caused by a lack of food globally . <eos>
