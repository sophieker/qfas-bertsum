<s> teaching the controversy : should the controversy be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> these are observable facts . what creationists defend is the idea that these changes can not create new species and as a result a design a designer and a creator is necessary . furthermore if schools do not teach competing theories it is comparable to teaching there is no alien life . this can not be proven or demonstrated however it would seem that if that fit in with their theory for the rest of biology the evolutionists would teach it without question . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the idea that creationists reject mutation or natural selection is ridiculous . <eos>
