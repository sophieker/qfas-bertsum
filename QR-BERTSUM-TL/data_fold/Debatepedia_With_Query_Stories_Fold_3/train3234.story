<s> punishment : is jail time a suitable punishment for laser pointer use ? <eos>

<s> currently in nsw anyone caught with a laser pointer and without a permit can get a sentence of up to 14 years in jail . that is not a suitable punishment for not even doing anything dangerous . that is unfair . <eos>

@highlight

<s> jail time is okay but not up to 14 years in jail . <eos>
