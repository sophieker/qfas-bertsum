<s> military : is an individual right to a handgun importance to civilian preparedness ? <eos>

<s> some arguing that one of the main purposes of the # nd amendment is to enable citizen to train with weapons so that they are prepare for military service or the draft . if this is the case and if the military is fully capable of supplying citizen with guns upon entering the service or being drafted then it is appropriate to restrict citizens estabished to training purposes at gun ranges . in this case there is no need for citizen to own guns but only the need for citizen to train with them such that they are fully prepare to serve militarily . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if # nd amendment aims only at military preparedness gun should be available for training only <eos>
