<s> vs tribunals : are court good than tribunals for trying terrorists ? <eos>

<s> john c. eastman . `` military tribunals are beautifully constitutional . '' promotional center . november # : `` the fifth amendment requires indictment by a grand jury but specifically excepted from that requirement are `` cases arising in the land or naval force or in the militias when in actual service in time of war or public danger . '' in other words the women and women serving in our own military force are not entitled to the benefits of trial in civilian courts nor are civilian serving in the militias when they have been called into service . it would be odd indeed to read the fifth amendment as affording greater access to civilian courts to non-uniformed soldiers of terrorism waging war on the united states than it <eos>
