<s> effectiveness : will a standing troops be more effective than the current un civilian system ? <eos>

<s> especially in fighting situations . in additional in a truly multinational force there will always be a good many individual soldiers who could be suspected of taking sides in a particular conflicts ( e.g . muslim or orthodox christians in the balkan conflicts ) ; are such soldiers to be pulled out from particular mission thereby perhaps weakening the whole force ? a un army might also end up being very poorly equipped for if the advanced military powers start to see the un as a potential rival or adversary they will refuse to selling it their best arms and armour . <eos>

@highlight

<s> differences in language cultures etc . will seriously mar operational effectiveness <eos>
