<s> the route : is the route of the security barrier unfair to the palestinians ? <eos>

<s> civilians in the west bank settlements deserve as much protection against terrorist attacks as anyone else . while the estimates that half of the west bank could be annexed are blown out of proportion israel acknowledges that the barrier does sometimes depart from the green line and therefore includes parts of the so-called palestinian territory . yet the barrier is not intended as a political border between two entities but merely as a hurdle between terrorists and their victims as former israeli defence minister benjamin ben eliezer has put it . its exact route has been dictated only by security considerations for example the need to prevent snipers having a clear line of sight on roads used by israeli settlers .

<s> the security barrier merely connects israeli settlements in the west bank : <eos>
