<s> `` keep '' : does `` keep '' in the # nd amendment refer to an individual way to `` keep '' ? <eos>

<s> it is possible that the intention of the second amendment was for communities to constitute `` keep '' in storage their weapons but not necessarily for them to keep these weapons in their homes as personal possessions . it should be regarded that a keep is noun referring to a place of safer storage . to keep then to some extent has the notion of safer storage significant with it . thus a right to keep arms could simply mean the right to keep weapons in community safer storage . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` keep '' could confer only a collective right to keep and stores not a personal right . <eos>
