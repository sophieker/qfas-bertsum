<s> prisoner abuses - are women at greater risk of being abused if they become prisoners of war ? <eos>

<s> male prisoners also contend with the threat of torture and rape but it is quite possible that misogynistic societies will be more willing to abuse woman prisoners . the threat of female prisoners of war being misused in this way may adversely affect the way in which their captured male comrades react to interrogation . and in a media age the use of captured female soldiers in propaganda broadcasts may have a different effect on the television audience back home perhaps weakening the nation s determination and commitment to the war effort .

<s> the threat of increased abuse of women prisoners is a serious one . <eos>
