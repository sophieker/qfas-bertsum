<s> democracy : is the superdelegates system adequately representative and democratic ? <eos>

<s> it is true that political parties are currently given the powers to choose the nominee that they desire through a process largely of their choosing in accordance with the right to association laws . but if it is claimed that the general election must be fully democratic why then not the primaries ? the caucuses are in fact where most partisan voters choose to their candidate . most democrats will vote in the general election for whichever democratic nominee arises and most republicans will vote in the general election for whichever democrat nominee emerges . thus the real `` choice '' for most citizens is made in the primaries . as such it is where citizens ' have the most powers of choice through their vote and it <eos>

@highlight

<s> voters should be completely empowered to choose primary nominee . <eos>
