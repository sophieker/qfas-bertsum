<s> economics : is an emissions trading system economical ? <eos>

<s> the main problem is that baseline emission allowances for companies are basis on their past emissions . for this reason a companies has the incentive to emit as much as possible when these baselines are being sets so that the baseline is above or at what the companies is already emitting . if a companies successfully trick the system in this way they will be able to emit carbon as they had before with no reductions being achieved . <eos>

@highlight

<s> companies will pollute overly before starting carbon trading . <eos>
