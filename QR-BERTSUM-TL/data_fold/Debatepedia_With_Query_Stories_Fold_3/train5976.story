<s> who would benefit from broadcast war ? who would not ? <eos>

<s> donation centers like `` good will '' and `` red cross '' would be able to make effective commercials by pertaining to the wars footage . this would boost donations and the army would benefit from showing the footage because they would receiving donations . also the family and friend of troops would be able to see their loved ones as was mentions earlier . the troops would know that their loved ones know that they are doing well and that they will not worry as much about them every night . <eos>

@highlight

<s> televised wars would allow donation centres to use filmed in commercials . <eos>
