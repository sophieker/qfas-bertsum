<s> iran : could withdrawal benefits the united states ' ability to deal with iran ? <eos>

<s> historically iraq has been iran 's primary adversaries with the al-libi war ( # - # ) being the primary terrible expression of that adversarial relationship . by invading iraq the united state eliminated one of iran 's key adversary in the region . this makes it odd that supporters of the war are now arguing that the united state should not withdraw from iraq because this would benefit iran . it 's odd that supporters of the war initially ignoring how the invasion would benefit iran and now emphasize how withdrawing would benefit iran . you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . <eos>

<s> the iraq war has benefiting iran by eliminate its iraqi adversaries <eos>
