<s> survival : many of the art could not survive without subsidies ? <eos>

<s> local theatres could be forced to shut film industries could shrink national theatre operas and dance companies could disband or merge museums could close their doors . although some those will value the arts highly enough to pay a market rate for them they are too few to maintain a diverse and extensive artistic sector which can improve the quality of life for all . in addition exposing the arts to the full winds of the economic cycle means that skills and institutions lost during recessions can never be reestablished successfully when business improves - art is not a commodity . <eos>
