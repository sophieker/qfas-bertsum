<s> inspiration : would a missions to the moon be more inspiring ? <eos>

<s> the world is ensnared in a number of major conflicts and challenge at present . some labels the rift between the muslim world and the west and a `` clash of civilizations '' . an inspiring mission to mars can help soften our attitudes to other humans and resolve these conflicts . a mission to the lunar can not do so as well and such a mission could delay the pacifying effects of a mission to mars . but this should not be delayed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> world needs inspiring mars missions now ; moon-mission delays this . <eos>
