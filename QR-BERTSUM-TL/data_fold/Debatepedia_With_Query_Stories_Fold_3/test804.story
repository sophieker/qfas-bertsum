<s> popular opinion : what are the opinions of australians on a republic vs. a monarchy ? <eos>

<s> it was the particular form of the republic offered which was criticised as the main reasion for the defeat of the referendum . supporters of the republic disagreed about the best proposed mechanism for replacing the monarch and prime-minister with either a head of state appointed by the parliament ( which was widely criticised as being undemocratic ) or with a directly-elected head of state ( which was widely criticised as moving australia away from the proven westminster system toward an american-style presidential system even though many parliamentary republics directly elect non-executive presidents ) . many republicans voted no therefore on the specifics of the referendums despite supporting the terms principle of moving toward a republic . a referendums on the terms principal of electing a head <eos>

@highlight

<s> the # referendums was rejected on specifics not the principle of republicanism . <eos>
