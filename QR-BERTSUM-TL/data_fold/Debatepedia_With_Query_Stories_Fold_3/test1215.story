<s> spirit : should `` merry christmas '' be taken in good spirit ? <eos>

<s> organizations and businesses that have a policy of saying `` merry christmas '' risk being seen as favoring christians . a non-christian that receives the message `` merry christmas '' could certainly therefore feel their faith is being excluded or just under-considered and could thus react very negatively to the message . subsequently while `` merry christmas '' certainly makes christians happy it carries the risk of offending non-christians . no matter what the intended `` spirit '' of `` merry christmas '' this risk is real for non-christians . `` happy holidays '' in so-far as it is less likely to offend is therefore in better keeping with the christmas spirit . <eos>

<s> `` merry christmas '' can offend non-christians . <eos>
