<s> security : is multiculturalism better for the safety and secure of a nation ? <eos>

<s> discriminatory against any culture produces racial hatred and a lack of regard and tolerance for those who discriminated . so what is better for the safety of the people ? accepting all cultures and thus not angering those cultures who may acts upon anger or simply refused some cultures and setting oneself up as a target ? it seems the former . <eos>

@highlight

<s> multiculturalism 's tolerance is a better principle than assimilation 's exclusivity . <eos>
