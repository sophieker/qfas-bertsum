<s> consumer safety : are gm foods safe/healthy for consumers ? <eos>

<s> the most common forms of alteration have been cross-breeding and irradiation . cross-breading involve breeding plant variations together to achieve desirable characteristics . irradiation involve blasting seeds with alpha rays to produce genetic mutations from which desirable variations are selected . both are law and are not considered `` genetic modification '' . but of course they are essentially equivalent making it wrong to alienating the process of `` genetic modification '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> conventional foods have always involvement genetic tampering <eos>
