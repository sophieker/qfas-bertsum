<s> undemocratic ? is the electoral university undemocratic ? <eos>

<s> - the fears of the electoral university surround instances in which the popular vote does not coincide with the electoral university results . but these fears are exaggerated principally because of the rarity of this occurring . this result has really only happened once in american history first in # with samuel harrison 's victories of grover cincinnati and then with the election of president bush in # . the # and # election result in which this occurred can not fairly be counted against the electoral university mainly because the result were directed by voter fraudulent and partisan factionalism . because it is so uncommon that the electoral university does not reflect the popular vote it is hard to say that the electoral university is <eos>

@highlight

<s> seldom has the loser of the us popular voting won the electoral university <eos>
