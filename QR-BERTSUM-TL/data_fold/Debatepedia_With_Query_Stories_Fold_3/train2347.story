<s> crops : are kangaroos significantly damaging crops ? <eos>

<s> if kangaroos are eating crops in specific areas why not move them to other habitats that are capable of housing them and that are not near crops ? this is an adequate solution to crop destructions and avoids the less humane action of culling them . <eos>

<s> moving kangaroos would address crop destructions in specific areas . <eos>
