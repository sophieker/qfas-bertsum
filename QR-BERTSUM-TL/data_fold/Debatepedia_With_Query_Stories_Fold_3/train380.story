<s> religious liberty : is the prohibition of school prayer consistent religious liberty ? <eos>

<s> the first amendments precludes state interference in the free exercise of religion . formal schools prayer merely assists pupils in the free exercise of their religious beliefs the suggestion that those children who wish to engage in prayer would initiate spontaneous prayer without the direction of staff is hopelessly unrealistic . when a congregation attends any formal service of worship they are engaged in the free exercise of religion notwithstanding the fact that the member did not write the prayers or hymns or passages they hear speaking sing or recite .
