<s> regional stability : is turkey and its area neighborhood relatively stable ? <eos>

<s> turkey is already a long-standing member of nato the defence club to which the large majority of current and prospective eu states belongs . this means that any security crisis on turkey s border already involves its european neighbours . furthermore as the eu has begun to develop its own defence identity outside nato it has had to involve turkey over issues of planning and access to nato assets . finally engagement between turkey and the eu has greatly reduced historic animosity between turkey and athens and held out hope for a solution to the division of cyprus showing the benefit of a closer relationship .

<s> turkey 's proximity to conflicts zone would not endanger the eu . <eos>
