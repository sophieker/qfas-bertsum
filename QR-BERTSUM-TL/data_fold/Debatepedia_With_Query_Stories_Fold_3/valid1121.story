<s> home-heating : is natural gas an important source of home-heating ? <eos>

<s> natural gas must have its own plumbing infrastructure in homes buildings cars and gas stations that use it . this infrastructure does not yet really exist . building and maintaining it would be expensive and would take time ; time which in the context of global warming we may not have . <eos>

@highlight

<s> natural gas requires a separate and special plumbing system . <eos>
