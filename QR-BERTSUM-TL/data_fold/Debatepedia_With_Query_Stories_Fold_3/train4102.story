<s> frozen embryos : should frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization be opened to research and funding ? <eos>

<s> according to a washington post article `` # # embryos frozen in the us '' # / # / # `` about # percent were earmarked for research ; # percent for destruction and a like number for donation to women ; and # percent for quality-assurance studies . most of the rest -- about # percent of the total -- were reserved for ongoing fertility efforts . the survey detailed in the may issue of the journal fertility and sterility did not ascertain how long embryos had been in storage -- a detail some experts said would make clear that most embryos saved for further fertility work are unlikely to be used for making babies . frozen embryos can remain viable for a decade or more but with each passing year <eos>

<s> the vast majority of the # # frozen embryos in the united states will either be stored indefinitely or destroyed <eos>
