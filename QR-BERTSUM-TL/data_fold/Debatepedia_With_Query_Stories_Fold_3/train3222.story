<s> prisoner abuses - are women at greater risk of being abused if they become prisoners of war ? <eos>

<s> a prevalent theme in many nationalist conflicts is to extinguish the bloodlines of the enemy culture and to proclaim that the enemy is trying to do the same to them . this manifests itself especially in the different balkan conflicts as mass murder of the men of the village and a systematic rape of the women . it is unlikely that women from a third intervening power in this situation will be treated any differently if that kind of fearsome mentality has already set into the minds of combatants .

@highlight

<s> the presence of women on the battlefield can increase the odds of physical abuse and sexual trauma . <eos>
