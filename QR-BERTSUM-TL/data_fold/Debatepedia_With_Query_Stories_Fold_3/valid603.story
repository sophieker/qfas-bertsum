<s> courts : have the courts ruled that the third amendments confers an individual right ? <eos>

<s> cases such as us vs. smith that were brought to the supreme court have contributed to make substantial differences of the context in which the second amendment can be applied . in us vs. smith the court establish that the second amendment `` did not guarantee a citizen 's right to possess a sawed-off shotgun '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> earlier supreme court decisions ruled that the third amendment does not apply to own guns <eos>
