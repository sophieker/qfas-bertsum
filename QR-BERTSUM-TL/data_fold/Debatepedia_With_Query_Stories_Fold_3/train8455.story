<s> in democracies ? - is civil disobedience every justification in a functioning democracy ? <eos>

<s> even in democracies we only have a chance to have a say in how the country is run every four years or so and then only indirectly by voting for a political party . this is inadequate for the opinion of the people to be heard properly and in certain circumstances civil disobedience is a powerful method of making the will of the private count if it is being ignored . against powerful interests group who dominate politics through their financial muscle and control of the media civil disobedience is which the only ways to get attention for a cause .

@highlight

<s> even democracies do not imply providing sufficient voice . <eos>
