<s> management : can nationalization improve the management of banks ? <eos>

<s> somebody has to run banks . those that are currently in management positions are better suited than those who are not . while some managers may be to blame for the crisis the majority are doing a good job . if the goal of nationalization is to replace existing or bad managers it will fail . it will remove the good as well as the bad managers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> current managers are best in crisis ; nationalization wo n't help <eos>
