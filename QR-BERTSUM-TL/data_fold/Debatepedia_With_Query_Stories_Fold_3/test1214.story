<s> family violence : does arranged marriage resulting in more abused and marital violence ? <eos>

<s> in the former case this is because they are very vulnerable . sometimes they are from far away from home don t speak the local language or dialect and are totally relying on the wife s house and family . the lack of a support network the language to appeal for help or knowledge of their rights makes women in arranged marriages disproportionately likely to suffer abuse . in the latter case arrangements commodifies women who are bartered between the female heads of houses . this is not acceptable within an egalitarianism model of citizenship and does not fits with a western model of rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> arranged marriages is bad both for the individual women concerned and for women typically in society . <eos>
