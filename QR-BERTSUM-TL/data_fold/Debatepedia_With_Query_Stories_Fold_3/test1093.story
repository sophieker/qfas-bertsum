<s> crops : are kangaroos considerably damaging crops ? <eos>

<s> kangaroos are breeding quickly and slower than they are dying . they are shark and are running out of food in their natural habitats . this means that they are frequently resorting to australian crops as a means of sustenance . culling kangaroo populations will decrease the resource depletion occurring in their natural habitats will enabling kangaroos to survive on their natural habit alone and sustainably and will decrease the necessity of kangaroos to consume crops as a means of survival . this will saving farmers crops increase their productivity and return and generally increase gdp across australia . <eos>
