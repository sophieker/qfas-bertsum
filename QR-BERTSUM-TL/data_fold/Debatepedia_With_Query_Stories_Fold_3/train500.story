<s> economics : what are the economics of carbon capture and sequestration ? <eos>

<s> `` no we do n't need ccs . '' rsc : `` to better understand the relative importance of the cost of ccs and its effectiveness in avoiding co # emissions we performed a comparison of carbon avoidance via ccs and using alternative energy technologies . ... considering ratios all three alternative energy technologies considered were found to be much more cost-efficient than ccs at avoiding co # . the carbon avoidance ratio ( ie the co # amount avoided by a $ # . # trillion investment in alternative energy over # gtco # ) was determined for each technology using ccs as a base case . wind nuclear and geothermal power had co # avoidance ratios of # . # # . # and # . # respectively . in order for ccs to be competitive with wind and nuclear the cost of <eos>
