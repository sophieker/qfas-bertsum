<s> does trading with human liberties abusers encourage human liberties abuses ? <eos>

<s> while it is truth that poor working condition and human liberties violation should be frowned upon it is also truth that the state of abject poverty is often worse and that employees are more than willing to partake in such condition for this very reason . while this is no excuse for violators and their habits should be encouraged to change it should be recognized that employment under harsher condition is better than no employment at all . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor working conditions are good than no work . <eos>
