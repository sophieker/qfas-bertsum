<s> cultural value ? is the flag clearly racist or does it have higher cultural value ? <eos>

<s> furthermore it is not as if every southerner or even most southerners owned slaves . only the wealthy plantation owners did and it also was not as if anyone could have simply freed their slaves and made the problem go away as it was nearly impossible for free blacks to find employment . while slavery was a great evil it was not something which could be fixed with a snap of the fingers and the fact that there were slaves in the south does not make the confederate flag a racist symbol . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the confederate flag represented more than racism ( a complicated issue ) : <eos>
