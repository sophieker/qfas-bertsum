<s> religion : is the ban tolerant/respectful of the muslim faith ? <eos>

<s> because this is only a ban in french public buildings muslims are free to wear the hijab anywhere else . because there is such a low muslim poulation and the hijab is allowed in most places it 's really not very hard just to abide by the french laws that have been in place for over a decade . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the ban only applies in public buildings . <eos>
