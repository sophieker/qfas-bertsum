<s> democracy : are the primaries sufficiently democratic ? <eos>

<s> in the past `` super delegates '' have been a way for the democratic parties to secure a candidates at their convention . these elected officials make up a significant portion of the delegate and are not bound to vote for a particular candidates besides who they want to vote for them . this meaning that the electorate has no influence on who these `` super delegates '' vote for . in a close election this can mean a large number of people with no cement ties to the electorate will decide the democratic candidates for the general election . <eos>

@highlight

<s> complicated secondary elections create confusion abroad <eos>
