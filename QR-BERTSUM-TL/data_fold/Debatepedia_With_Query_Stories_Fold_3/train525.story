<s> religion : do vouchers rightly/wrongly support religious schools ? <eos>

<s> education is used to inculcate values that the society believes in and to promote social and civic awareness . religious schools promoting anti-female policies for example should not be receiving taxpayer funding in the form of vouchers . this violates the constitutional separation of church and state . state funds can not be separated from state control . it matters not whether the state is not directly making the choice to fund religious schools . taxpayer funds should not be allowed to be directed toward religious schools .
