<s> economics : is libertarianism economically beneficial ? <eos>

<s> jonathan stein - `` once we begin distinguishing the many forms capitalism can take analytic utility is lost by retaining talismanic terms like `` free market . '' there is no national economy in the world today that is not a mixed economy which also means that there is no market that is free or even `` mostly '' free . rather markets are structures that are culturally bounded always regulated and genetically dependent on government intervention for their reproduction . never are they simply `` permitted . '' '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> free market capitalism is a non-existent myth in modernity <eos>
