<s> property : is the communist perspective on collective owners of property appropriate ? <eos>

<s> - benjamin franklin - `` all property surely except the savage 's temporary cabin his bow his hoop and other little acquisitions absolutely necessary for his livelihood seems to me to be the creatures of public convention . hence the public has the rights of regulate descents and all other conveyances of property and even of limiting the quantity and uses of it . all the property that is necessary to a man is his natural right which none may justly deprive him of but all property superfluous to such purposes is the property of the public who by their laws have created it and who may by other laws dispose of it . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> society must collectively own many forms of property through government <eos>
