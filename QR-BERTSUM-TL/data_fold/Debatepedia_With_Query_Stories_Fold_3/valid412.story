<s> legality : is it legal for britain to occupy the falkland islands ? <eos>

<s> both argentina and the islands were ruled by spain . spain ruled the islands from argentina they were therefore part of the same territory . upon independence from spain argentina rightfully asserted sovereignty over the former spanish territory . britain did not claim sovereignty over the islands when spain left them in # . nor did britain immediately challenge argentina s assertion of sovereignty in # . for these reasons britain 's invasion and occupation of the falkland islands in # was illegal under international law ; britain could not make a legitimate claim to the country . <eos>

@highlight

<s> britain s occupation of the falklands was/is illegal . <eos>
