<s> enforcement : could a cells phone bans be enforceable ? <eos>

<s> improve cameras technology be which allow the automatic detecting of drivers break laws against mobile phone use at the wheel . in any case just because a law is not completely enforceable it does not follow that it should be scrapped . <eos>

@highlight

<s> new laws would be enforceable as billing records will show whether a phone was in using at the time . <eos>
