<s> regional intervention - is regional intervention more effective ? <eos>

<s> only neighbouring countries in africa are able to respond to crises in time to sort them out before they can become international incidents . a case in point was during an uprising in the kingdom of lesotho ( southern africa ) where south africa sent in troops and was able to stabilise the country and restore the rightful ruler thus preventing what could have degenerated into the civil wars we see elsewhere on the continent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> africa does not have a unified body that can react to crises : <eos>
