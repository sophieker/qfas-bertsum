<s> jewish interests : does right of return help/harm israeli interest ? <eos>

<s> there are many things that israel can and has offered to palestinian refugees : compensation assistance in resettlement and return for an extremely limited number of refugees based solely on family reunification or humanitarian considerations . but an unlimited right of return for all refugees and their descendants simply goes too far . this is largely because it is purely unworkable to allow millions of palestinians to return back to a territory that is already overcrowded . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unlimited right of return goes a step too far . <eos>
