<s> theory : is negotiation better than a direct military action ? <eos>

<s> hardly can we negotiate with terrorists insurgents or guerilla . as these groups violate the pillars our society stands on - freedom justice democracy etc . - we need to act instead of prevaricating in national parliaments or international bodies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> deeds not words . <eos>
