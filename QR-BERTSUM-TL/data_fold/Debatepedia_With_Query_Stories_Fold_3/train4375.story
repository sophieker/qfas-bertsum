<s> security : would a missile defense system increse europe security ? <eos>

<s> john brookes . `` the case for europe missile defense '' . heritage . marches # # - `` despite the ranges of concerns about missile defense it should be emphasized that missile defense is a defensive not offensive weapon . indeed the dominant design of the missile defense interceptor warhead does not even contain an explosive charge ; traveling at # # miles per hour it destroying the missile warhead by the sheer force of the collision . therefore the idea that missile defense is an offensive system as those have suggested is demonstrably false . in a way missile defense is like an umbrella ; it is only needed if it rains . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> missiles defences are inherently offensive not offensive <eos>
