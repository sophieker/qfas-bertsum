<s> security : are international security courts for sanctioning cuba unfounded ? <eos>

<s> sanctions are often a `` softer '' better alternative to the use of military meat . this has some resonant in the cases of cuba . in # three us civilian planes were shot down by the cuban air force nearby cuba . the america states could have responded on some proportional level militarily . president clinton decided however to use sanctions instead to punish the cuban regime with the helms-burton act . therefore the continued sanctioning of cuba through # and to present was to some extent the preferred alternative within the clinton administration to military action against cuba . <eos>

@highlight

<s> # helms-burton bill justly followed cuba shooting down two military airplanes <eos>
