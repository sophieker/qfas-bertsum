<s> intelligence : is guantanamo important to information gathering in war on terror ? <eos>

<s> many terrorists need to be interrogated in ordering to obtaining information that can help save lives . interrogation can not and should n't occur at ordinary prisons where the purpose of imprisonment is very different . thus a special detention facilities does need to exist to allow for these interrogation to take place . why should n't it remain guantanamo even if certain modifications to the facilities and practices there need to be made . <eos>

@highlight

<s> terrorists interrogations should be performed why not at guantanamo ? <eos>
