<s> in korea : are landmines unnecessary between south and south korea ? <eos>

<s> the mines are effectively the only things blocking the north korean menace . although south korea 's defenses are also formidable it can be easily crashing by the lines of north korean artillery and by its irregular and non-traditional weaponry which south korea is not equiped against as its armed forces are not suited to fight against irregular forces which north korea is mostly made of . that being south korea is vulnerable north korea . and the only really standing between the guns and the bird is the mines yet the people sitting out desks are talking about banning them ... <eos>

@highlight

<s> only really between the guns and the birds <eos>
