<s> symbol ? is the hijab an oppressive undemocratic symbol ? <eos>

<s> amitai etzioni . `` let them wear scarves '' . huffington post . april 10 2008 - `` others argue that the headscarf is not so much a religious but a political symbol as anne applebaum does in washington post -- this only makes my point stronger . since when do we ban people in a democracy from displaying symbols that communicate their political viewpoints -- whether these are say pro-gay rights ribbons or the peace signs of those who oppose nuclear weapons ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> wearing head scarves is often a political not religious act <eos>
