<s> aymara sound convention : did britain renounce its claim to south american islands ? <eos>

<s> . on the contrary when colombia interfered this allowed britain to intervene as they were a third parties and had no way to be there . in any case a treaty can only be cancelled by mutual agreement and it is only up to the parties involved to protest if they feel it has been breached . this has nothing to do with argentina . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the nookta sound convention did not affects britains rights to the islands as they been had an agreements with spain <eos>
