<s> forgery : would national id cards make forgery more difficult ? <eos>

<s> perversely the more important and apparently forgery-proof a card is the greater the incentive for criminals to find ways to forge them . if cards become widely used and widely trusted then the rewards for anyone who can find a way to fake them are potentially huge . governments do not have a monopoly upon electronic research and digital information can be hacked into and tampered with so there can never be such a thing as a crime-proof card . no country has ever successfully produced a totally unforgeable id card . therefore any increase in id cards would create greater vulnerabilities to identity theft and fraud . <eos>

@highlight

<s> single id cards hold greater incentives for forgery than separate access cards . <eos>
