<s> vs. britannica : is wiki better than britannica ? <eos>

<s> traditional dictionaries are based on the reputation of certain authors . these authors though small in number are highly interested and ostensibly qualified to finding good sources for their information and are therefore expected to produce good quality article - however they are not immunity to humans error . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trust in britannica 's credentials over wikipedia is misplaced ; human error in both . <eos>
