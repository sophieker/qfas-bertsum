<s> military aid : is aiding pakistan 's military insufficient compared to a unilateral strike ? <eos>

<s> the criticisms about the aid given to the paksitani government reflect a gross inadequacy on the part of the u.s. as the leadership that brokered the aid . it clearly failed to check up in proper intervals that results were being made . therefore any inabilities on the part of the pakistani military to deal with threats there is in part the fault of the united states and should therefore not be a justification for us unilateral action . <eos>

@highlight

<s> misuse of us military aid is partly the blame of the united states and ca n't justify unilateral us action there <eos>
