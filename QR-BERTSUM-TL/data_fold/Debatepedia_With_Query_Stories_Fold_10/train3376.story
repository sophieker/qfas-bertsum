<s> there is some information in the world that is essential to know as a means of communicate effectively and analytically with other individuals in society if as a citizen or in the marketplace . standardized tests help ensure that all students learn this important information . it is true that this information can be cut-and-dry and perhaps even boring including history literacy ( reading comprehension ) and math . yet it is nevertheless essential so testing for it and ensuring students know the information is socially and educationally valuable . yet it is also true that this essential information does not constitutes all the information that a community may believe their child should know . <eos>
