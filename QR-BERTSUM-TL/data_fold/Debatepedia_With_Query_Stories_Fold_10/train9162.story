<s> compromise : are health insurance cooperatives a good compromise ? <eos>

<s> that something is political difficult with significant opposition does not mean it is a bad idea . it says nothing about the underlying merits of the plan . in fact this argument seems to be used frequently as a means to side-step the debate on the merits of the plan which is distasteful and un-principled . opposition to the public plan and in favor of a co-op should be based on the actual underlying arguments of whether one or the other would be better for america not on whether one or the other is popular or politically convenient . <eos>

@highlight

<s> political difficulty of public insurance is no argument against it . <eos>
