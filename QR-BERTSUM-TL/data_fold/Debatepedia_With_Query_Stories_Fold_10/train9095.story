<s> free speech : is military recruiting consistent with free speech ? <eos>

<s> the military has unmatched resources to dedicate to marketing and recruiting . no recruiters from other industries can match this . this is why once again military classes are categorically different in terms of how aggressively they can pursue recruits . <eos>

@highlight

<s> non-military recruiters lack similar resources for recruiting . <eos>
