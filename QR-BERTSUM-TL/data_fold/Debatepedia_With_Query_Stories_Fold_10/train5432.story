<s> illegal immigration : does arranged marriage boost illegal immigration ? <eos>

<s> . illegal immigration is often motivated by the want for a better life using underhanded methods . at times that method may be an arranged marriage but it may also be a dating marriage or more likely it may be finding any way to sneak into a country . arranged marriages are pretty public they often involve religious and cultural ceremonies a great deal of expense ( families travelling abroad ) and an include an entire network of people ; more importantly in many cultures where arranged marriage is common the dissolution of a marriage is a shameful situation for the individuals involved especially if the dissolution stems from something as superficial as trying to get an entry visa . <eos>

<s> the cause of illegal immigration is not arranged marriages <eos>
