<s> electric grid : are electric cars compatible with electric grids ? <eos>

<s> electricity demand is lowest at night time . this is a great time therefore for electric cars to charge-up . electric cars would therefore add electricity demand when the grid is capable of supplying it . for this reasons electric cars will not strain the electric grid and may not force large grid upgrades . <eos>
