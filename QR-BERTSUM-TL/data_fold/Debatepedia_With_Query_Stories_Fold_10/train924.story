<s> full of rules described as `` policies '' and `` guidelines '' with a hierarchy aimed at enforcing these and with many individuals promoting instruction creep . it is asserted that this has been used to delete useful info and informative images and to deface articles through over-application of bureaucratic processes . debates as part of the bureaucratic process divert individuals from editing and improving articles . <eos>
