<s> npov : is wikipedia 's neutral point of view ( npov ) sound ? <eos>

<s> most if not all contributors have a political bias even if they pretend not to or think that they do n't . effectively they are all working to undermine articles another ways or one as politics defies npov . yet attempts to define wikipedia : political dispute continue to fail in part because people who pretend to be `` not political '' claims it 's just editorial problem not a real world issue creeping in . <eos>

@highlight

<s> politics defy and can not easily be handling by npov . <eos>
