<s> mission : are the missions of charter schools sound ? <eos>

<s> charter schools and the competition they introduce produce a two-tiered education system in which public schools are essentially abandoned for what are supposedly better charter schools . this is because charter schools have the power to deny students enrollments if they do not qualify generally on the basis of merit . this stands in contrast to public schools that must accept those in the district that enroll . the problem is that this creates an `` exclusive '' tier in the public schooling system leaving public schools with those that are `` less qualified '' . this degrades public schools and their intellectual environment and makes it harder for public schools to show statistical improvements and obtain needed funding . instead of this why not make public schools work <eos>

<s> charter schools create two-tiers ; lets public schools fail <eos>
