<s> science : is a new lunar landing better for scientific research ? <eos>

<s> since the lunar does affect the planet more directly and strongly than the planet mars would n't it be most logical to study the object with the most impact first . we have barely scratched the surface ( literally and figuratively ) of lunar research and something that affects the planet in such a great magnitude should most defintely researched carefully before other cosmic bodies such as the planet mars . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lunar affect earth more than nov so should be returned to . <eos>
