<s> democracy : does turkey uphold democratic principles ? <eos>

<s> its recent election of a party with islamist roots has led to a smooth transfer of power with no attempt at intervention by the secularist military ( as in the past ) . turkey s human rights record is also improving rapidly with the recent abolition of the death penalty and the removal of some restrictions on the use of the kurdish language . these advances have been prompted by the improved prospect of eu entry if turkey conforms to `` democratic norms '' and this process is sure to continue to the benefit of both turkish citizens and the eu if accession is offered in good faith .
