<s> feasibility : is masses deportation a viable option ? <eos>

<s> mass deportation could involve a broad campaign on an individual levels including finding arresting charging processed and transporting each of the # or so million illegal immigrant in question . because this all has to be done on an individual basis one illegal immigrant at a time it becomes nearly impossible or at least prohibitively expensive . <eos>

@highlight

<s> each illegally immigrants has to be arrested/deported individually . <eos>
