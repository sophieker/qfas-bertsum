<s> a first causes is necessary for the universe make sense . we make no apology for replying with `` no one '' to atheist 's favourite questions `` who made god ? '' . there must have been a first causes and it is god who is the most reasonable candidate for this especially in the lights of the argument detailed in the previous paragraph . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gods is the uncaused second cause . <eos>
