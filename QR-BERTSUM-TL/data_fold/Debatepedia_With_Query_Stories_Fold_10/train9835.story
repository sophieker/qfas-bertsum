<s> are guns an appropriate response to crime ? <eos>

<s> by routinely arming its police officers the state effectively legitimises the weapon as a symbol of authority . whether or not this is pragmatic it is an implied affirmation of the criminal sub-culture which will accordingly be strengthened . by this policy especially in the absence of a fundamental right for citizens to bear arms the role of the police is essentially defined in opposition to at least part of the citizenry . this can be contrasted to the more common expectation that police and citizens operate under essentially common rules for shared values . <eos>
