<s> raul a. reyes . `` arizona 's un-american immigration law . '' los angeles times . april # th # : `` when she signed this law gov . jan brewer stated that she would not tolerate racial profiling . yet at a news conferences she was able to answer the question 'what does an illegal immigrant look like ? ' if she does n't know how are police to know ? because arizona 's law offers no guidelines as to what constitutes a sabti suspicion ' that someone is undocumented police will possibly resort to profiling of latinos on an unprecedented level . is n't goldberg outraged by these apparent violations of the # th amendment 's protect against unreasonable search and seizure ? or of the # th amendment 's equal protect clause ? guess not .
