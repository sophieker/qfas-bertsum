<s> rights : which system good protect rights ? <eos>

<s> the terms `` invisible foot '' was coined by e.k . hunt . explanations of how capitalism crushes human relations can be found in lives inc by douglas rushkoff and parecon : lives after capitalism by jackson albert . the arguments are too long to make them here but this side has made a few of them in other parts of this debate so you can look at them for a brief introduction to the idea . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism is no `` invisible hand '' but a crush foot . <eos>
