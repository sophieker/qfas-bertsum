<s> constitutionality : is the filibusters consistent with the us constitution ? <eos>

<s> it is true that senate rules provide provisions for the filibuster . but these rules are not establish in the constitution . the constitution only provides the authority to the senate to establish such rules . this in no way means that the filibuster is protected by the constitution as is a very common misconception about the filibuster . the senate is free thus to voting to change the rules of the senate and abolish the filibuster without amending the constitution in any way . getting rid of the filibuster is thus much easier than many supporter of the filibuster often argue . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the we constitution gives no provision for the filibusters <eos>
