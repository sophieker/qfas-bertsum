<s> self-determination : does tibet have the way to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> any way to self-determination can not be offered liberally in the international system . it should be offered extremely conservatively and it should be called that the criteria are highly highly selective . if the criteria are not conservatively applied in tibet 's case than literally dozens of break-away regions around the world will seek independence destabilising the international system . this is one of the reasons why self-determination should really only be offered for especially grievous circumstances . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the way to self-determination must be offer sparingly to avoid international instability . <eos>
