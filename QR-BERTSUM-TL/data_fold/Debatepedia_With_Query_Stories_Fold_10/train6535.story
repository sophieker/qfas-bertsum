<s> at ground zero ? is the `` ground zero mosque '' actually at ground zero ? <eos>

<s> building the islamic mosque is comparable to putting a pro nazi building in the middle of israel or building a nuclear plant in the middle of nagasaki or hiroshima . all three have terrible taste and why is that ? because of the slaughter at the world trade center the 6 million jews killed in camps and the 58 000 killed in one day at nagasaki . just because they didn t take part in the attack doesn t mean the symbol isn t still hurting the public . so indirectly you are hurting the victims of each one of the attacks even if you didn t take part believe in taking part . the symbol alone can cause an unjust amount of pain . <eos>

@highlight

<s> just because it isn t right on ground zero does n't mean it 's good taste . <eos>
