<s> prolonged isolation : is prolonged isolation a legitimate tactic ? <eos>

<s> prolonged isolation might be uncomfortable and upsetting for and individual but it does not go so far as to cause severe pain and suffering . the operative word here is severe . there is no physical contact between the interrogators and the prison no physical pain and only mental disarray and frustration . all suffering is moderate and temporary . it therefore can certainly not be considered `` torture '' and can be justified in certain exceptional instances when information is needed and can likely be obtained through this technique . <eos>
