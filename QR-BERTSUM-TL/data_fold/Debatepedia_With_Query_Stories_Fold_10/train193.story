<s> importance : would dna testing have an important impact in solving crimes ? <eos>

<s> the most serious violent crimes notably the offenses of rape and murder are most commonly committed by individuals known to the victim . when the suspects for the commission of a crime are obvious dna detection is superfluous . moreover it is invidious to propagate the belief in the public that crimes can be solved or criminals deterred by computer wizardry . unless the dna is used to identify a genetic cause for aggression violent crimes will continue to be committed .
