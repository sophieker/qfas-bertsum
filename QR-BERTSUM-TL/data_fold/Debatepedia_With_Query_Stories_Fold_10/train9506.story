<s> ideology : is socialism inherently pernicious ? <eos>

<s> whatever rhetoric may be used the reason of ownership of property is having control over the use and disposition of said property . when another speaks of `` collective '' ownership another is really speaking of government ownership . as a practical matter then the representatives of the state then grant usage of property to individuals who then effectively own it . the real questions is if individuals will gaining the use of property through the exchanges of their own productive labor or if they will gaining its use through political influence . communism is simply a newer atheistic forms of feudalism with divine way of kings replaced with political way of the commissars . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` collective '' owners is an sick defined concept . <eos>
