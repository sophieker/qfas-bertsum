<s> harm : is smacking harmful for children ? <eos>

<s> the 'no ' side of this arguments said that it is okay to slap children in the context of a loving family environment . the environment is most of the when not 'loving ' and smacking a child is not loving and compassionate for it . most of the when smacking occurs out of that context and most parents who slap their kids are not exactly `` loving '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if a child is being slapped that is not exactly a loving family environment . <eos>
