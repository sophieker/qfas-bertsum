<s> public interest : is official english in public interest ( safety etc ) ? <eos>

<s> official english does not constrain the government to always in every situation providing only english in its services . it rather makes a general rule that the government is not obligated to provide these services but allows for the government to provide services in other languages when there is an exceptional compelling state interest to do so particularly for health safety tourism economic development and for libraries ' foreign language materials . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> official english has exceptions for safety health etc . <eos>
