<s> soldiers : would an early withdrawal honor us soldiers ? <eos>

<s> commanding troops means making the choice to put them in harms way or withdrawal them from harms way . command decisions have nothing to do with soldiers feeling `` unsupported '' . it is their duty to serve . making the emotions of soldiers a factor in command decision entirely corrupts the nature of command responsibilities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hiding behind `` support the troops '' abrogates the responsibilities of command <eos>
