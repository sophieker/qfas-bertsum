<s> female preferences : do females prefer circumcised penises ? <eos>

<s> `` circumcision alters sexual function '' . national organization of circumcision information . opposing views - `` the movements and skin contact an intact man needs to reach orgasm are compatible with the movements and skin contact a woman needs to reach orgasm . the dryness abrasion and chafing complaints of some women along with their inability to have an orgasm are oftentimes complications of circumcision . a circumcised male has little lubrication of his own and he removes much of a woman 's vaginal lubrication with every outstroke . in addition a circumcised male needs longer strokes to stimulate the small sensitive area ( frenular remnant ) on the underside of his penis to reach ejaculation . each long outstroke distances him from the woman 's clitoris making it harder for her <eos>
