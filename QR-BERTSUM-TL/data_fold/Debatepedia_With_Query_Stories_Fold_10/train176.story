<s> international security : is the situation in darfur a threat to the international system ? <eos>

<s> history likens sudan 's actions to that of hitler . precedence shows that countries that start with internal acts of terror are very likely to extend their terror beyond their borders . hitler 's germany is a prime example of a country that rallied for geographical extension following a removal of domestic human rights . the analogous issue of darfur does not bode well for the future of africa if we are non progressive . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sudan is a threat beyond its own campaign of genocide . <eos>
