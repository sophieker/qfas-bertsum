<s> detainees treatment : are detainee treated adequately in gitmo bay ? <eos>

<s> many believe that due to the emotional separating between terrorist and the rest of society whose doctrines they threaten and evident pathological and intolerable nature of their action they should not be treatment the same as other citizens . to do so would be to justify their existence and coupling their crimes with those of robbery . surely attempted mass murder and religious cannibalism is grounds for treating detainees differently . providing their is sufficient evidence that these inmates are terrorist and do pose an immediate threat to society then guantanamo is not only justified but recommended . <eos>

@highlight

<s> terrorists do not deserves luxuries treatment . <eos>
