<s> economics : is algae biofuel financially viable ? <eos>

<s> biofuel that are create from land-plants all have particular soil-quality requirements . if soil in an area does not meet the particular nutrient requirements of a biofuel plant-type that plant can not be constructed and use to produce the biofuel in the land-area . algae because it grows in water ( of almost any kind and quality ) is not restricted by soil-quality . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there are no soils requirements for algae biofuel . <eos>
