<s> discrimination : are women generally more sometimes discriminated against ? <eos>

<s> women even in the # st century face discriminatory at work for one simple reason : they are viewed as future ( potential ) mothers who are likely to take maternity leave . therefore the companies are unwilling to hire and subsequently promote women which clearly is discrimination . ( regrettably the fact that there are alternatives to maternity leaving such as parentage leaving nannies or not having children at all is commonly overlooked ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> discrimination at workplace . <eos>
