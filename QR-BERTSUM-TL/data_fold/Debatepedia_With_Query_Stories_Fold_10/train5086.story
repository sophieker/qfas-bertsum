<s> decency : is bullfighting decent or does it verge on animal torture ? <eos>

<s> bullfighting bloodbath.com : `` bulls are not the only creatures to suffer in bullrings . the tormented bull does not understand that it is the man on the horse 's back that is causing his pain only that he is in agony . he therefore sees the horse as his enemy as much as the man . it 's not unusual for horses used in bullfights to be so badly gored by the bulls that they have to be killed but only after they have been dragged from the ring and the view of the spectators . '' <eos>

<s> horses suffer in bullfighting as much as bulls . <eos>
