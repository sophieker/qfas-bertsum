<s> rating/voting system - would it be beneficial ? <eos>

<s> if implemented on a larger scale this system could be a useful feedback for the editors - which argument needs developing better explanation new evidence or which are well developed and accepted by the public on the other hand . also no vote has ever been neither # % reliable nor accurate - there is no absolute truth so these words does n't even make sense in this context . vote is an expression of one 's ( possibly wrongful ) feeling about some subject . vote reflects opinion about a subject how can this possibly be accurate/inaccurate ? the outcome of a poll consequently reflects the distribution of opinion ( s ) among people - again this distribution may be a wrongful one ( in somebody 's eyes ) but getting info about it <eos>

@highlight

<s> voting system would provide feedback . <eos>
