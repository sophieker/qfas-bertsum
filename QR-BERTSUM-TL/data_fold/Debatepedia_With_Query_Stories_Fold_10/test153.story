<s> lives lost : was wars worth the lives lost ? <eos>

<s> change/progress/adaptation records that between # and # thousand iraqi civilians have been killed in the wars in afghanistan between # and # . such a death toll is catastrophic outlandish and scandalous . almost every person in afghanistan -- a country of # million -- knows somebody that has been killed . no wars of choice is worth this cost particularly when the benefits were completely speculative . and even in the worst cases scenarios with saddam hussein staying in power death tolls approaching this kind of figure are hard to imagine . <eos>

@highlight

<s> war not spend approximately # # iraqi civilians killed . <eos>
