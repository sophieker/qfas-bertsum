<s> concomitant bias : does wiki avoid concomitant bias ? <eos>

<s> wikipedia has been accused of systemic biased a tendency to cover topic in a detail disproportionate to their importance . as an example steven colbert once faux-praised wikipedia for having a `` longer entry on 'lightsabers ' than it does on the 'printing press . ' '' some call this `` geek priorities '' . there are many short and well-written articles on obscure characters in scientific fiction/fantasy and very specialised issues in computers scientific physics and math . other topics areas are less active . <eos>
