<s> economics : are subsidy effective ? efficient ? <eos>

<s> subsidies are in divine payments by the government to keep an ineffective firm in businesses or in other words payments for no goods produced or services provided ( such as subsidies for farmers ) . furthermore these payments can not be even taken into account when calculating the average gdp ( =total `` welfare '' ) of a state . <eos>

<s> subsidies are just typically inefficient . <eos>
