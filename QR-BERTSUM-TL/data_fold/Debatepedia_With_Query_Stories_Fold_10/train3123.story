<s> maintenance : are tidal energy plants easy and cheap to maintain ? <eos>

<s> the disintegration of some tidal energy turbines and barages is unavoidable . the problem surrounds recovering the lost parts . while disintegrated wind turbines ( a common problem ) can be easily retrieved on land it is nearly impossible to recover disintegrated tidal energy parts from the sea . therefore these parts may float around as a hazard to both boats and marine wildlife . <eos>
