<s> democracy : are the primaries adequately democratic ? <eos>

<s> while it may be important to have a system in which some state are first in the primary election is it necessary that it always be new hampshire and iowa ? no . why not have a rotating system in which different states are given the right to go first each year . <eos>

@highlight

<s> primary elections distribute power unequally among voters <eos>
