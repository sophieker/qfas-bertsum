<s> is prostitutes a criminalized crime ? <eos>

<s> there are many danger related to all kinds of law professions . a person working in a factory risks dismemberment chemical burn and in some cases even death . a consumer of any product equally risks injury due to defective parts or shoddy construction . in everything we do we are choose a levels of risks that is acceptable . the risks of a client catching an std is known and the client is willing to take that risk . to use that as a terms for victimization would be silly when you could catch e-coli from a bag of spinach . <eos>

@highlight

<s> quick-charging no more harmed than other workers/consumers . <eos>
