<s> consumption : could legalization increase drug-consumption ? <eos>

<s> this will be the cases amongst all groups - addicts previously casual user and those who were not previously users . addicts will still steal to fund their habit because they want all the drugs they can get and because addictions means they find it hard to holding down regular jobs . if drug provision is strictly regulate an illegal black market may remain . <eos>

@highlight

<s> higher prices caused to legalization of drugs will increase consumption <eos>
