<s> economics : would public owners of water be more cost-effective than a global commons ? <eos>

<s> - for profit companies are managed by individuals with a direct for-profit stake in the efficiency and productivity of their company . if they manage their companies poorly they lose money . if they manage their companies well they profit . it is this direct profit-interest at the managerial level that ensures for-profit companies in terms perform efficiently . conversely there is not profit interest at the managerial level in government-owned companies . if the government-owned companies performs highly effectively or somewhat effectively it matters less to executives of these companies because it does not typically affect them monetarily . thus for-profit companies have a higher incentive structure for the efficiency operations of its companies and the empirical evidence generally demonstrates this to hold true . <eos>

@highlight

<s> water privatisation is more financially efficiency <eos>
