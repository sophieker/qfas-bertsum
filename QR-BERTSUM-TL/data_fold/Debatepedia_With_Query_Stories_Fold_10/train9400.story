<s> efficacy : can carbon capture and storage be effective ? <eos>

<s> ipcc has provided estimates of air emissions from various ccs plant designs ( see table below ) . while co # is drastically reduced ( though never completely captured ) emissions of air pollutants increase significantly generally due to the energy penalty of capture . hence the use of ccs entails a reduction in air quality . <eos>

@highlight

<s> ccs coal plants emit less co # but more pollutants <eos>
