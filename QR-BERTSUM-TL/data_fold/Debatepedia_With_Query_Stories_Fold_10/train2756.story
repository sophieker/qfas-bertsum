<s> a vast majority of our previous relationships is nurtured only via computers social networks sites or chat rooms . no longer do young those going out and chat they sit at home and write short messages instead . this of courses damages not only the relationships themselves but which ruins our ability to express ourselves in speech . <eos>

@highlight

<s> communications become impersonal . <eos>
