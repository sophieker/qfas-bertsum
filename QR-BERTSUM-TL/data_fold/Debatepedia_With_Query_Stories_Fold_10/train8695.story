<s> illegally immigration : would id cards help stem illegally immigration ? <eos>

<s> non-citizens seem centrally to enter in violation of laws for the purposes of participate in financial transactions . if a ) all our money was instantly electronically traceable and auditable and b ) all financial transactions required an access key to participate and to access our financial systems then c ) those without access keys could not be paid . thus the incentive to enter illegally would be removed . note this would not be the same as making the value of `` legal tender '' revocable . it would only require that a `` financial access key '' be presented to gain access to our financial systems and conduct a transaction . <eos>

<s> id card could be used as a tool to deny illegally immigrants access to mainstream financial systems . <eos>
