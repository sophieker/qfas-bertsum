<s> crime : is crime outside of dispensaries manageable ? <eos>

<s> the legitimate place of dispensaries in supplying individuals that suffer from illnesses with access to medicine must be separated from the crime that may or may not surround them . this crime is unrelated to the fundamental mission of medical marijuana dispensaries so it should not be used against them just as crime surrounding other legitimate businesses can not be used to argue against the legitimate purpose of these businesses . <eos>

<s> medical marijuana is unrelated to crime that surrounds dispensaries . <eos>
