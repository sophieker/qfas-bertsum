<s> dominion : do humans have dominion over animals ( and a right to hunt them ) ? <eos>

<s> animals lead independent lives with independent goals that typically have nothing at all to do with humans . a good example are fish living at the floor of the ocean . how can humans have `` dominion '' over these fully independent creatures ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> animals are independent creatures that do n't exist to serve humans <eos>
