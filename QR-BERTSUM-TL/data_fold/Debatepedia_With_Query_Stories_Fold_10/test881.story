'' the salt lake tribune . october # # : `` when a significant number of patients is unable to pay for health such as the # percent of americans currently in that situation not only do costs increased for everyone but quality of health decreases as limited humans and materials resources are drained to support those unable to financially contribute to the system . [ ... ] evidence strongly supports that these issues already significantly affect all of we direct or indirectly . when someone no insurance gets sick we all get to pay the price . '' <eos>
