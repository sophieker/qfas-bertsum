<s> should a government have the right to draft its citizens into military service ? <eos>

<s> a government becomes oppressive under the following two conditions : ( # ) when a government infringes upon the rights of individuals ( # ) when a government has rights that the citizens themselves do not have a military draft meets both these conditions ; it infringes upon an individual 's right to consent and the citizens themselves do not have the right to draft others so the government demanding military service of these individuals would be imposing a double standard . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a military draft is reflective of an oppressive government . <eos>
