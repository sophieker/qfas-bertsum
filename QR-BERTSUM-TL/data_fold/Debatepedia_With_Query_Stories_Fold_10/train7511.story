<s> physicians : is free universally health care reasonable to physicians ? <eos>

<s> one can not have a right to other people 's services . does a physician not have the free right of association and contract with patients ? why would physicians be forcing to perform free or government-set prices for their labor ? why should n't they be able to charge market value for their services ? did they enter into their practices with the understanding that they would not be able to charge fair market value ? no . they are generally service providers like any other that expect fair market-driven compensation . universal health care would deprive physicians of this liberty to charge market-value by imposing government pricing on their service almost certainly at a discounted rate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a way to health care violates the rights of doctors <eos>
