<s> resources : are develop state more obligated with more resources ? <eos>

<s> developed state obviously have more wealth to employ in combating globally warming . these more able countries have a responsibilities to employ their available financial resources toward fighting globally warming . developing countries also have this obligation to commit as much as they can but because they have far fewer available resources their obligation and commitment will merely be smaller . developed nations are uniquely obligated to employ these higher available resources in the fight on globally climate change . <eos>
