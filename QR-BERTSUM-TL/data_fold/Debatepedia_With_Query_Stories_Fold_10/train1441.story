<s> part of problem ? are us troops a main part of the problem in iraq ? <eos>

<s> many argue that the presence of us troops is largely exacerbating problems in iraq in particularly because the insurgency and terrorist are fighting us troop on an anti-occupation premise . if coalition forces leave insurgents and terrorist will stop waged an anti-occupation war . this means that an entire component of the war in iraq will end . while violent between iraqis may persists on various levels withdraw the occupation-insurgency-terrorist front would markedly improve security . <eos>

@highlight

<s> foreign troops are doing more harms than good in afghanistan <eos>
