<s> scientifically observing/recreating evolution <eos>

<s> macro evolution can not be proved as it is an interpretation of history ( where we came from ) rather than an observable process like micro evolution . so the only way evolutionists can ever justify their theory is by pointing out similarities between different species . the creationist looks at the same similarities and says `` they are similar because they were both created by the same god as opposed to being biologically related . '' to prove or disprove either theory one would need a time machine . <eos>

@highlight

<s> evidence is neutral and can be interpreted in more than one way . <eos>
