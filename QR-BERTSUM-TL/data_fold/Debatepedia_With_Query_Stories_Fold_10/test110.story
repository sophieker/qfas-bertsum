<s> saving offenders : would castrate help `` save '' offenders from themselves ? <eos>

<s> court testify has displayed that many sexual murderers would dearly like to be free of their overwhelming sexual urges . for this fact they often request castration in order to save themselves from themselves . in the same sense forcing castration of repeat sex offenders can save these individuals from themselves . there are plenty of examples of these kind of individuals but one particularly notable one is james jenkins a sexual offender held in a virginia jail who castrate himself with a razor in order to relieve himself from his urges . he says in # to the seattle post : `` castration has done precisely what i wanted it to do . i have not had any sexual urges or desires in over three years . <eos>
