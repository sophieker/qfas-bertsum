<s> deficit : will balanced budgets help solve debt/deficit ? <eos>

<s> kathy white . `` guest commentary : a federal balanced budget amendment would hurting the economy . '' denver post . july # th # > `` traveling back in time is no way to prepare for the future . you meet the future by making investments that will pay off . families take long term loans to buy homes and pay for college . businesses borrow to take advantage of modern technologies and more efficient facilities . states and local governments borrow to build and maintain roads dams schools and prisons . denying the united states government that same basic tool would jeopardize generations of progress . indeed a balanced budget amendment would be like forcing a family to pay the entire cost of a house up front or making a college student <eos>

@highlight

<s> balanced budget amendments undervalues loans and debt <eos>
