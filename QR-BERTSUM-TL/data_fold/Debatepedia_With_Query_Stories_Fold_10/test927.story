<s> sexuality role : does pornography play a constructive role in sex ? <eos>

<s> watching other people perform a sexual act can help one to fully discern and realizing the actual silliness and emptiness of sex ( from the consciousness point of view ) hereby enabling one to build-up a healthy distance from the whole issue . by watching pornography one can train sexual self-control which can come handy either during the sexual act or in the process of consciously avoid it ( resisting seduction respecting partner 's mind ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sex improves self-discipline with distance from sex . <eos>
