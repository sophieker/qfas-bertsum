<s> current measures to tackle drugs at the source ( i.e . by detaining dealers and breaking the supply chain ) are not succeeding . it is particularly importance to protect teenagers at an impressionable age and at the time when their attitudes to education greatly affects their whole lives . some sacrifices of human rights is necessary to tackle the drug problem . <eos>

@highlight
