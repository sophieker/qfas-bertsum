<s> alternatives : are alternatives to animal testing inadequate ? <eos>

<s> the main reason why many alternatives to animal testing are not being used is that they are impractical or too costly ; it is not because alternatives do not exist . the problem with this is that it makes it appear as though it is only valuable to save animal lives when it is practical . this places the dignity of animal life far below its actual value . <eos>

<s> alternatives are not being used when it is not practical which is wrong . <eos>
