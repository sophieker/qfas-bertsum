<s> child protections : do pat-down scanner protect rights of minors ? <eos>

<s> terrorists groups do not do age discriminatory when it comes to situations of terrorist 's acts . however # the photographs can be obscures or face can be covered while scan showcasing pictures like these . # the pictures are ghostly ( i.e they don affect privacy issues for minors ) # the new full body scan machines are well equipped to making such secure checks are not obscene . we should n't gamble with lives on issues which can be tackled by policies & technology . <eos>

@highlight

<s> scanner can be modified to accommodates children . <eos>
