<s> is the federalization of europe going to benefit europe politically ? <eos>

<s> once unified europe will become an ( even more ) important negotiating and trading partner ; among the largest economies in the world . it will have a population of # million more than the united states and russia combined . it will be the world s largest trader and generate one quarters of global wealth . it presently gives more aid to poor countries than any other donor . its currency the euro comes second only to the us dollar in international financial markets . france germany poland - these countries can hardly ever negotiate something with giants such as the us or china . europe as one country stands a good chances of putting its message across effectively . <eos>

@highlight

<s> higher influence . <eos>
