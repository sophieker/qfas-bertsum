<s> hurricanes displace living plants and animals into areas that may need more nutrients . think of it this way if a possum dies on a highway and is left on the pavement animals can eat the meat but the decomposition is lost on the asphalt the same holds true for a tree growing on a sidewalk . the hurricanes actually move the nutrients to a more accessible place .

@highlight

<s> hurricanes actually help the envrionment . <eos>
