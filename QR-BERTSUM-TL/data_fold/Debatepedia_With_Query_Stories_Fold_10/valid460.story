<s> china bloc : does china have the capacity to form a threatening political bloc among nations to counters other global powers ? <eos>

<s> as the largest recipients of international aid and a very reluctant donors china is certainly not buying herself any allies . china is not even a cultural leader for ethnic chinese populations exemplified in its failure to demand un or asean intervention in indonesia in # - # during the persecutions of the ethnic chinese sector of society . for two thousand years china abhorred the notion of international interdependence and claimed that she was big enough simply to learn from the outside world whilst controlling her own destiny . although economic globalisation has modified this approach there is no evidence that it has evolved into an aggressive or expansionist philosophy .

@highlight

<s> for such a large country the influence that chinese exerts over other nations is astonishingly small . <eos>
