<s> regulation : could/should the state make drug-consumption safer ? <eos>

<s> in practice this usually just means making drugs purer and therefore perhaps more deadly and addictive . many illegal drugs are closely related to potentially dangerous medicines whose prescription is tightly restricted to trained professionals but the proposition would effectively be allowing anyone to take anything they wished regardless of the known medical dangers . in addition the offer of purer drugs will encourage many who are currently put off by the uncertain risks of drug taking to begin drug abuse . it also implicates governments in drug-taking by making them the guarantor of purity standards . furthermore the state can provide services like needle exchanges to minimise the secondary risks of drug use without legalising drugs themselves . <eos>

<s> there is no such thing as a safe drug ( regulated by the state ) . <eos>
