<s> vacation : will getting rid of winter vacation be tolerable ? <eos>

<s> another of the historical reason for avoiding school during summer was the lack of air conditioned during summer months . this is a problem throughout the united state and southern canada especially for younger buildings . school buildings classrooms in particular tend not to be well ventilated . this is not a handicap when buildings have to be heated but is when an younger building is retrofitting for summer use . room air conditioners are usually inappropriate for spaces with high ceiling and lots of volume - typical of most classrooms . they would also require electrical retrofitting . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those schools buildings are not built for summer use . <eos>
