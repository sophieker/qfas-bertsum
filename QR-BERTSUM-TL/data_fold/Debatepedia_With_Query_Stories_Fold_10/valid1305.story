<s> # war : were britain 's actions in the # war illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> . the junta was ordered to remove their forces from the islands under resolution # . as this did not happen the british forces intervened . as for the belgrano it was outside of that exclusion zone but that was no law ! britain had the right to attack anything in self defence including military bases in argentina if need be . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the british had permission from the un to use reasonable force to retake the islands <eos>
