<s> cap : will enlargement fit with common agricultural policy ? <eos>

<s> this is where land and labour costs and environmental standards are much higher than in the east . the prospect of newest entrants receiving vast subsidies under the common agricultural policy ( current cost $ # billion per annum ) would make this danger worse while the collapse or reduction of the cap under the strain of expansion would be catastrophic . not only would a collapse of the agriculture industries of current members be an economy and strategic disaster it would have grave environmental consequences . <eos>

@highlight

<s> expansion could decimate farming in eastern europe . <eos>
