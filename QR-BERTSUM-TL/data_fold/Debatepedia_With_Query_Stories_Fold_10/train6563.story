<s> society : does mandatory services help solving social ills ? <eos>

<s> ilya somin . `` why mandatory 'national service ' proposals target the young . '' volokh conspiracy . september # th # : `` at this point i know some ethicists will claim that the young `` deserve '' any politics setbacks they suffer because they do n't participate in politics enough . such arguments overlook the obvious fact that many of the politics disadvantages of the poor ( e.g . - lacking of money lacking of accessing to politics office lacking of experience ) are ones that they ca n't easily offset . and whatever the validity of the terms view that the young should spend more time on politics activity i hope we can agree that forced labor is not a proper punishment for spending too bit time on politics .

<s> mandatory service unjustified to increased political engagement . <eos>
