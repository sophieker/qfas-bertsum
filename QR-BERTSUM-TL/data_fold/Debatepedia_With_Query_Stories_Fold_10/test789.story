<s> who would benefit from televised war ? who would not ? <eos>

<s> they might often receive hate mail because they show soldiers in combat killing the enemy . this also puts the reporters in danger because they are as much of a soldier as any other in the enemy 's eyes . this would make getting a reporter out there much harder and the news company would have to give a huge raise for the conditions that they were working in . also this might make people who are thinking about joining the army change their mind after they see what the field conditions are like . this would make it harder to fill in empty spots left in the army from victims of war . <eos>

<s> televised war puts reporters in a very dangerous position . <eos>
