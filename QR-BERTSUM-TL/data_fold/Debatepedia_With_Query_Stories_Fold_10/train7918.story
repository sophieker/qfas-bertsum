<s> clone : is cloning fair to cloned humans ? <eos>

<s> if clones are treated poorly by society they will lead less happy life as others . if they are treated well they will likely lead equally happy life as normal people . because their happiness will depend largely on how we receiving them we need only adjust our attitude to be more receptive . banning cloned because we will oppress them is not fair ; it punishes clones for our failures . <eos>
