<s> economics : is reactors electricity economical ? <eos>

<s> mark hertsgaard . `` the true costs of nuclear power '' . mother planet news . april/may # : `` the best case against nuclear powers as a globally climate remedy begins with the fact that nuclear-generated electricity is very expensive . despite more than $ # billion in federal subsides over the past # years ( roughly # time more than solar wind and other renewables energy sources have received ) nuclear powers still costs substantially more than electricity making from wind coal oils or natural gas . this is mainly due to the cost of borrowing money for the decade or more it takes to get a nuclear plant up and running .
