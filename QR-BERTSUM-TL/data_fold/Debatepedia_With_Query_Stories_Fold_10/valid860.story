<s> rights : is the libertarian perspective on individual liberties appropriate ? <eos>

<s> persons are independent in their ability to make moral choices based on their own moral compass . persons therefore must be held accountability to themselves . libertarianism acknowledges that persons must be accountability in this way while major government programs and welfare programs do not ( making persons accountability for other other individuals ) . this undermine the dignity of an individual as their own free moral agents . in general if an individual wants to make poor choices it is importance that they alone are held responsible for the consequences . this is the only way to taught persons to take responsibilities for themselves and change . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those are free moral creatures accountable to nobody but themselves . <eos>
