<s> vs. gas tax : are gasoline economy standards exceptional to a gas tax ? <eos>

<s> ezra klein . `` gas taxes vs. cafe standards '' . the american prospect . # nov # -- `` gas tax unlike cafe increases are basically impossible to pass . particularly now . it 's one thing to sneak in a gas taxes when fuel is cheap but convincing americans of it when they 're demanding a drop in gas prices is not i think a sound recipe for politics survival . it just wo n't happen . on the other hand # % of americans support an increase in cafe standards . that does n't make it easy ; the auto industry is a powerful lobby . but they 're going to fight a gas taxes too so i 'd rather our politicians be battling back with an overwhelmingly popular proposal rather than running into industry opposition <eos>

@highlight

<s> fuel economy requirements good ideologically than gas taxes <eos>
