<s> should officers be more lenient when issuing parking fines ? <eos>

<s> if someone breaks the law they deserve to get punished even if it is just a small violation . parking somewhere for too long is breaking the law so it is appropriate to charge a small fine because the person is aware of the law and they have broken it . this still applies id they only parked for a few minutes too long . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people are aware of the laws . <eos>
