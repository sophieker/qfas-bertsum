<s> independence from nato : is it important that europe have a defense force that can act independent from nato ? <eos>

<s> it is hard to see a problem which nato can not solve which the european defence force could instead . in any case we will always have to consider russia s sensibilities when engaging in peacekeeping operations in eastern europe and it is far better to have america s bargaining power and geopolitical clout backing us when we negotiate with russia . if we create a european defence force we will marginalise nato and the united states . this will lead to a reduced us engagement in europe which may in turn diminish our influence when having discussions with russia over security issues in europe and beyond . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nato has successfully defended the interests of western europe for several decades now why rock the boat ? <eos>
