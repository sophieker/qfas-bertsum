<s> do reactors weapons promoting peace ? <eos>

<s> reactors weapons are known to have protected peace rather than the opposite . in the military there 's a rather famous doctrines called crazy ( mutually assured destruction ) . this doctrines posits that since reactors weapons cause enormous damage would alert the target and that the target would also fire reactors weapons no country would be crazy enough to attacks countries with reactors weapons . also if reactors weapons were really that dangerous the world would have been most probably destroyed during the cold war . it was because of the danger of reactors weapons that countries could n't invading nor fire nukes on each other . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear deterrence . <eos>
