<s> animal kill ... is animal testing justified on basis that animal harm one-another too ? <eos>

<s> michael pollan . `` an animal 's place '' . the new york times magazine . november # # - `` my first line of defense was obvious . animal kill one another all the time . why treat animal more ethically than they treat one another ? ( ben franklin tried this one short before me : during a fishing trip he wondered 'if you eat one another i do n't see why we be not eat you . ' he admits however that the rationale did n't occur to him until the fish were in the frying pan smell 'admirably well . ' the advantage of being a 'reasonable creature ' franklin remarks is that you can find a reason for anything you want to do . ) to the 'they do it too ' defense the animal right-wing <eos>

<s> that animals harm/kill each other does not justifying the same by beings <eos>
