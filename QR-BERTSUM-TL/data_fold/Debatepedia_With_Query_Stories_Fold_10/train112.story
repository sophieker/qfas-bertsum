<s> tradition : should promotion of the traditional nuclear family be avoided ? <eos>

<s> just as married couples receive tax benefits and unmarried mothers may suffer cuts in welfare legal prohibition of adoption by gays is a natural step towards this ideal . the traditional nuclear family is still an ideal that should be clung to and which deserves the protection and motivation of the state . evolution and nature has shown that the natural development of the young is aided by both these influences . <eos>

@highlight

<s> opposing gay adoption preserves traditional family as ideal for child-rearing . <eos>
