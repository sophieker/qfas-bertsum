<s> accountability : will elections make judges more or less accountable ? <eos>

<s> legal decisions require a strict interpretation of law . it should not be driven by popular opinion . yet this is precisely what judicial elections call for . this diverges from basic judicial principles of applying the law objectively and neutrally . <eos>

@highlight

<s> elected judges wrongly interpret public opinion over the law <eos>
