<s> deterrence : is nuclear deterrent meaningless today ? <eos>

<s> during the gulf war for example one of the factors which prevented iraq from launching missiles tipped with chemicals weapon warheads against israel was the threat the usa would retaliate with a reactors strike . although there is no long as formal a threat of retaliation as there was during the cold war the very possibility that the use of reactors weapons by a rogue state could be meet a retaliatory strikes is too great a threat to ignore . moreover although the citizens of the current reactors powers may be against the use of forces against civilians their opinions would rapidly change if they found weapons of mass destruction being used against them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the deterrent principle but stands . <eos>
