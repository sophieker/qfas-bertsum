<s> climate aid should be directed only at responding to humanitarian crises that may result from climate change . it should not be directed at preparing sectors of an economy to adjust . the marketplace can handle these adjustments good as government are not likely to making consistent accurate market prediction about which sectors and which companies are likely to benefit or lose-out from climate change . <eos>

@highlight

<s> climate aid should only be for crisis not development . <eos>
