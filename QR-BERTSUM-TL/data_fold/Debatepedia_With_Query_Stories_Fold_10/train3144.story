<s> lftr reactors : are liquids fluoride thorium reactors ( lftr ) a great idea ? <eos>

<s> unlike pwr lftrs operate at low pressure which is unfavorable because of lower electrical loads on reactor vessels and other parts of the machinery hence lowering the risk of accident . it also decreases the size of containment building required to attach the reactor . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tibor reactor operates at low pressures . <eos>
