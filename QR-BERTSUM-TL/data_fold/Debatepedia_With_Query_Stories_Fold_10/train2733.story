<s> personality : does debate affects people 's behavior in a positive way ? <eos>

<s> sadly debate tournaments can be also seen as an opportunity to get drunk with one s friends because parents are far out - and tournaments s organizers do not ( usually ) care . worst still peer pressure cause but younger children to join such `` parties '' which is clearly harmful for their healthcare and personal values . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debate tournament are not just about debating . <eos>
