<s> legitimacy : was the invasion of iraq illegal/illegitimate ? is continuing it illegal/illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> while the justifications can be debated until the cows come home the reality in iraq and the us presence there must be addressed at face value . actions now must be based on considerations of the best interests of the united states iraq the region and the world at large . any withdrawal that is based purely on the legal justifications going into the war would turn a blind eye to the present moral considerations and would thus be amoral and possibly immoral . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the us has to make the best of iraq irrespective of faulty justifications going in . <eos>
