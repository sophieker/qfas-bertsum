<s> brien jackson . `` in defense of the filibuster '' . below the fold . february # th # : `` having the filibuster as an option still restricts a relatively small majority that may not even acurrately reflect the will of the electorate from ramming through unpopular aspects of their agenda . [ ... ] the most picture-perfect argument for the senate is ironically that old bugaboo the # election . until jim jeffords bailed on the gop republicans controlled the house by # votes had the majority of a # - # senate split based on the tiebreaking vote of the vice-president and of course had control of the white house despite getting fewer votes for the office than the democratic candidate . additionally they lost seats in both houses of congress <eos>
