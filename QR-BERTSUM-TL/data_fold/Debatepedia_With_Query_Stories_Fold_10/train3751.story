<s> `` do n't ban four loco in n.h. '' the new hampshire editorial . november # th # : `` do n't take away individual rights . if you want to discourage something educate us on its risks . it makes more sense to convince us to follow a practice than to force it upon us ( particularly in this case when it 's not that hard to get across the state 's border ) . education is the way to go . we gladly published a guest op-ed on tuesday from unh health services and we believe the media 's coverage has made the risks obvious .
