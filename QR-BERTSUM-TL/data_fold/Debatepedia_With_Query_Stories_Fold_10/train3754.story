<s> demographics : would the demographics in afghanistan allow for a partition to happen cleanly ? <eos>

<s> some have argues that afghanistan can not or should not be partitioned because there is too much integration between the sectarian groups there . yet this demographics integration is changing more and more over time with shia shia and kurdish groups continually separating out into their corresponding communities and regions . this means that the demographics conditions for the partitioning of afghanistan are becoming increasingly unfavorable over time . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the partitioning of iraq could simply formalize the sectarian separations that are occur more and more on the ground now : <eos>
