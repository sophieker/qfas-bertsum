<s> crime/gangs : could legalization reduce crime and the presence of gangs ? <eos>

<s> that are paying their people pennies a day and pass the savings on to us ? corporations have proven that they have no problems trading for blood diamonds nigeria oil or united fruit i certainly they would have any problem dealing with pablo escavar . what we would instead be doing is giving the existing gangs in third world countries an flight legitimacy to finns there citizens . even the present gangs could still survive move into the rising demand for harsher drugs like heroin or cocaine . the preset drug dealers would also almost certainly find a niche market bootlegging to get around these high taxes that would be placed on the product . <eos>

@highlight

<s> in the short terms it might eliminate drug dealers on our streets but do any of us really think that <eos>
