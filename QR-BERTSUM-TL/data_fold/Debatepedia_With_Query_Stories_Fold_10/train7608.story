<s> security : are the appointers a security risk ? <eos>

<s> while it is possible that secure officers could ask women to lift their veils in specific security-related situations this is insufficient . many countries are set up with video cameras for example designed to be able to tracks the identity of individuals who may pose a risk . the veil compromises this whole system and lift the veil upon requested obviously does not solve the issue . nor does it solve issues like individuals wearing the burqa in order to commit a crime . <eos>

@highlight

<s> identity need be visible at all time not just upon request . <eos>
