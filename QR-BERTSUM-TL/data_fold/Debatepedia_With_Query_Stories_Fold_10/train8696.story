<s> the landing sites can be viewed from space by moon-orbiting spacecraft . the landing sites themselves can be viewed and photographed by spacecraft in lunar orbit . in fact in 1994 the clementine lunar orbiter photographed the landing site of apollo 15. in 2001 scientists at brown university in rhode island compared the photographs of the apollo 15 landing site from clementine to pictures taken during the apollo 15 mission from the endeavour command module . the scientists were able to locate the lander at the exact point on the lunar surface delimited by nasa during the mission . <eos>
