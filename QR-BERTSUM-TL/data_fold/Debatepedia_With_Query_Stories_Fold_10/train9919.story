<s> perfect-every-time outsourcing : are exemption justified in context of outsourcing ? <eos>

<s> develop countries often outsource manufacturing/emissions to develop countries . for this fact develop countries should not be treated on equal terms and develop countries should be given exemption for the dirty outsourcing for foreign countries . china has complained on this point that it is `` the place where the us effectively outsources much of its pollution . '' it has called for joint international responsibility for at than part of china 's emissions and has made private in jan # # violation of chinese environmental law committed by multinationals in china . other develop countries have a similar problem in which they are accused of polluting too much when they are merely the manufacturing engine of develop countries that outsource to them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> develop outsourced reciprocation to developed . <eos>
