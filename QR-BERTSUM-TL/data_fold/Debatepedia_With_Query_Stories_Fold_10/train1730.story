<s> voter participation : do closed primaries improve voter participation ? <eos>

<s> the closed primary would be seen as great for voter participation . second the closed primary allows nonpartisan or independent voters to participate in the nominating process . if these voters are allowed to help select the nominees then they be be more likely to vote in the general election since one of the candidates would be someone the non-partisan voter voted for . also a moderately member of one party be agree more with a candidate for the nomination of another party . this voter will have more of an incentives to participate in the general election if there is a nominee whom he or she agrees with . <eos>

@highlight

<s> open primaries increase independents ' participation in general election . <eos>
