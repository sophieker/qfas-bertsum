<s> deep water oxygen depletion : is this a consequence of algae blooms ? <eos>

<s> when organic bloom detritus sinks into the abyss a significant fraction will be devoured by bacteria other microorganisms and deep sea animals which also consume oxygen . a large bloom could therefore render particular regions of the sea deep beneath it anoxic and threatens other benthic species . <eos>
