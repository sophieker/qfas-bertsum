<s> private safety : is the using of cell-phones while driving a private hazard ? <eos>

<s> if one is early there is little difference in apologized while in their car over a cell phone and apologized in front of their bosses at the office . so they should have the restraint to drive at the speed limit arriving early and being willing to apologies then ; an apologetic cell phone call in a car to a bosses should n't be the cause of one being able to then relax slow-down and drive the speed-limit . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those should not explain in car on phone why they are running late . <eos>
