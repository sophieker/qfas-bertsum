<s> steven pearlstein . `` it 's time to give up on the public option '' washington post . august 19 2009 : `` the public option has become for the left what `` death panels '' have become for the right -- an easily understood metaphor that can be used to wage an ideological war over the issue of big government and mostly a sideshow . '' <eos>

<s> public option is only an ideological symbol for the left <eos>
