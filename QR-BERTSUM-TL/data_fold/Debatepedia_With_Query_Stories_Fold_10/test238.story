<s> presume that some or most abortions should be discouraged is # months a good cut-off ? <eos>

<s> while one might better give the benefit of the doubt to important question of `` when does life begin '' to conception by # weeks we have sufficient development in the fetus/baby to have a very developed and recognizable human babies form with movement and we have heart beating and brains waves . these two pulse and brains activities are measurements for if one is `` alive '' even as an adult . so while abortion might remain legal prior to # months after # weeks abortion should definitely be opposed discouraged or unlawful ( with some minor legitimate exception perhaps ) . there should be no exception for states or vagueness about `` medical necessity . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> any cutoff definitely should n't be any later than 1 months : <eos>
