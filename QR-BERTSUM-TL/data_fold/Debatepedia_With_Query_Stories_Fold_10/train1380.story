<s> energy needs : is the tgd an important supplier of china 's energy needs ? <eos>

<s> china is very inefficient in its energy use . if it were to increase efficiency its energy demands would shrink substantially or at least they would n't spiral upwards as fast as they are . the three gorges dam therefore might not have been necessary if china had adopted a more efficient approach . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china needs greater energy efficiency not the tgd <eos>
