<s> is killed civilians `` for the greater good '' justifiable ? <eos>

<s> natural rights are violated due to deaths by terrorists . imagine rights as a infinte number no matter what you multiply it by it 's but infinity and that is the value of rights . how do we know we acheived for the greater good ? we do n't the greater good is justice and justice is never attainable because it may be justified in one 's eye but not the other . thus it is n't justified to killing an infinite number of rights for justice because we can not achieve justice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> violates rights and justification can not be achieved . <eos>
