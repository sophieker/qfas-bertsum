<s> morals : can assassinated be justification on morality terms ? <eos>

<s> by assuming the power to take life arbitrarily even in an supposedly good cause we cheapen the values of life itself . many terrorists murderers or indeed dictators would and have claimed similar legitimacy for their violent actions . only if we ourselves respect humans rights totally will our promotion of these values seem valid to others . states that use assassination as a political weapon will soon find that others seek to turn it against them . <eos>
