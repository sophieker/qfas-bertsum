<s> tradition : is tradition inadequate to ban gay marriage ? <eos>

<s> traditions can be making traditions can be destroying traditions can be followed . just because something is traditional does n't think that we should follow them . during the middle ages bathing and washing was considered sinful and untraditional . does that think that we should not bathe and wash just for the sake of tradition ? no . like this traditions disappear when they making no sense and when we no longer need them . traditions are making because we need them . we 're entering a new age . let 's face it . the rules do n't apply anymore and traditions are rapidly disappearing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> how about washing ? <eos>
