<s> thomas dematteo a non-practicing christian from dingmans ferry delaware usa : `` there are pastors and ministers who are permitted to marry and it does n't affects their job in doing god 's work . i really do n't see a problem with priests being able to wed. '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> marriages and family do not distract from priesthood <eos>
