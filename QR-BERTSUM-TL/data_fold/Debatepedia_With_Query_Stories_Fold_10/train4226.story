<s> teaching the controversy : should the controversies be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> the idea that creationists reject mutation or natural selections is ridiculous . these are observable facts . what creationists defend is the idea that these change can not create new species and as a resulting a design a designer and a creator is necessary . furthermore if schools do not teach competing theories it is comparable to teaching there is no alien life . this can not be prove or demonstrated however it would seems that if that fit in with their theory for the rest of biochemistry the evolutionists would teach it without question . <eos>
