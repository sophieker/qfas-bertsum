<s> irrespective of what kind of work they are doing this deprives them of something so importance that we make it compulsory for all children . although the minimum legal requirements can sometimes be provided by tutors on the set or sports academy it can be hard to keep performance and education in necessary balance when one appears to bring so those immediate rewards both in terms of fame and money .

@highlight

<s> if children are work or performing they are not spending their time in formal education . <eos>
