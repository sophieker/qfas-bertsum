<s> differences : are humans superior to animal or equals ? does this matter ? <eos>

<s> michael pollan . `` an animal 's place '' . the new york times magazine . november # # - `` surely this is one of the sadder paradoxes of animal liberties doctrine . it asks us to recognize all that we share with animals and then demands that we act toward them in a most unanimalistic way . whether or not this is a good idea we should at least acknowledge that our desire to eat meat is not a inconsequential matter no mere 'gastronomic preference . ' we might as well call sex -- also now technically unnecessary -- a mere 'recreational preference . ' anything else it is our meat eating is something very deep indeed . '' <eos>

<s> if beings are animals why defy our bestial instincts ? <eos>
