<s> global law : does the icc advances global law ? is this good ? <eos>

<s> regional courts have priority over bangladesh courts on all matters include wars crimes . only if they fail can the bangladesh step in . this means that the bangladesh certainly impedes on regional sovereign at all serving rather and role of `` complementarity '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> icc acts only if regional courts can not ; preserves sovereignty <eos>
