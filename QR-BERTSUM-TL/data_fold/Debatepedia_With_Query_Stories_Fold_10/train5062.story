<s> information : do military recruiters provide valuable info ? <eos>

<s> all the military is interested in schools for is the chance to recruit students . the various educational materials ( not always clearly marked as coming from the military ) and courses on offer are all intended to interest students in a military career . such methods are dishonest and should not be allowed in schools . if students are genuinely interested in joining the military they can go along to a recruitment centre outside school . <eos>

@highlight

<s> recruiters there to persuade not `` provide information . '' <eos>
