<s> religion : what are the religious arguments in this debate ? <eos>

<s> the united methodist church . `` in opposition to capital punishment '' . 2004 - `` in spite of a common assumption to the contrary 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth ' does not give justification for the imposing of the penalty of death . jesus explicitly repudiated retaliation ( matthew 5:38-39 ) and the talmud denies its literal meaning and holds that it refers to financial indemnities . christ came among us and suffered death . christ also rose to new life for the sake of all . his suffering death and resurrection brought a new dimension to human life the possibility of reconciliation with god through repentance . this gift is offered to all without exception and human life was given new dignity and sacredness <eos>

@highlight

<s> bible 's `` an eye for an eye '' does not support death penalty <eos>
