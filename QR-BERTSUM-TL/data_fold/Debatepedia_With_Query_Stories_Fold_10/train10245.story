<s> wealthy : is a progressive tax system fair to the wealthy ? <eos>

<s> progressive taxes are often so complicated and with so many loopholes that the wealthy are able to evade their obligations . as a result they end up paying a smaller rate than other less wealthy citizens . a flat tax would eliminate this unfair tax avoidance and force the wealthy to pay their full burden . <eos>

@highlight

<s> progressive tax systems open door to unfair tax avoidance <eos>
