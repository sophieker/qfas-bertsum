<s> is it necessary to charge fat passengers extra when flying ? <eos>

<s> airline companies charge ridiculously large amounts for excess baggage weight . and fat people are usually more than just a few kilograms over the limit . they even charge for a bag just # kg ( # . # pounds ) overweight . if a person is so fat that the airline needs to pay more for fuel consumption the airline ca n't afford to pay out of their own pocket . fat people are usually more than just a few kgs overweight . if the airline ca n't afford bags and luggage that is too heavy then really they ca n't afford to pay for fat people either . a small fee for overweight passengers certainly would be sensible and okay . <eos>

<s> they charge a lot for excess baggage there is n't a difference . <eos>
