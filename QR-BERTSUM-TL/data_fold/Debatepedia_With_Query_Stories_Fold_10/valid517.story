<s> hiv/aids : is church policies on contraceptive appropriate in context of hiv/aids ? <eos>

<s> there are clearly harms that result from even a small proportion of the world s # . # billion baptised catholics ( # m and # m of whom live in africa and latin american respectively ) failing to using condoms to protect against aids . in # there were # m hiv/aids sufferers worldwide # . # m of whom lived in sub-saharan africa with the total figure predict to double by # . the catholic churches is thus partly responsible for at least some of the # . # m deaths every years from hiv/aids . whilst the trend in european nations is towards lapsed catholicism in africa strict obedience to the churches s teachings remains strong and so it is reasonably to assume that the churches could prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths <eos>
