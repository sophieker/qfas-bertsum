<s> sovereignty : should states have sovereignty controls over their water resources ? <eos>

<s> - failed states are often capable of managing their own resources and therefore fostering conditions that degrade human rights . if we consider waters a human right than poor waters management by failed states could justify an global intervention to protect these human rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a global water commons would address the mismanagement of water resources by failing states <eos>
