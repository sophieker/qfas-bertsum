<s> families : do the families of patients have an interest in euthanasia ? <eos>

<s> the dying have a profound sense of shame and guilt being in the condition that they are and causing their family substantial burdens and strains . if euthanasia is available they may choose it simply out of this sense of guilt which would be wrong . no regulations can prevent this from occurring particularly because the patient would give the appearance of choosing euthanasia completely voluntarily . and it would be voluntary but in the context of guilt rather than self-interest . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the ill will feel pressure to seek euthanasia to avoid burdening family <eos>
