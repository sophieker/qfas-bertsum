<s> elected individuals frequently appoint those to high positions based on their mutual loyalty as opposed to their competence . and these appointed officials are not appointed by citizens and can not be recalled by them . in a direct democracy these officials would be elected by and could be recalled by citizens . this means that these officials are too more accountable to citizens and the democratic process .
