<s> national identity : do the roma have a strong cultural and national identity fitting for independence ? <eos>

<s> of the several hundred delegates who gathered at the prague congress few were democratically elected and none came from hungary home to the most politically conscious gypsies . few gypsies in the ghettoes have ever heard of the organisation . indeed a reluctance to vote and the difficulty of holding democratic elections and producing an accountable and representative leader for an ill-defined transnational minority is one of the practical stumbling blocks to granting the roma nationhood . romany people see themselves indistinctly if at all . romany culture is one of patriarchal families and sometimes clans but never a nation . even the 17 romany parties within slovakia failed to form a national coalition due to mutual dislike .
