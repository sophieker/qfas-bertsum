<s> making we safer ? : is internment actually making we safer ? is it a good counterterrorism strategy ? <eos>

<s> the proposition 's arguments rely upon the accuracy of secret intelligence which supposedly identifies individuals planning terrorist acts but which can not be reveals in open court . past examples suggest that such intelligence is often deeply flawed . for instance when internment was introduced in northern ireland in # over # of the # original detainees were released within two days when it was realised much of the special branch intelligence that had been used to identify them was incorrect . recent intelligence failures in the campaign against al-qaeda point to the difficulties western intelligence services have in penetrate and understanding non-white groups while intelligence on iraq 's weapons programmes was also clearly flawed . so not only will many of the wrong people be unjustly <eos>

@highlight

<s> giving the governments the power to detain suspects without due process of law will not make society any safer . <eos>
