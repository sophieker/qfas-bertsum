<s> economics : is compulsory vaccination economical ? <eos>

<s> vaccines themselves are expensive to develop in the lab and to mass produce for widespread compulsory vaccination programs . in addition to these upfront costs organizing compulsory vaccination programs across an entire country can be very complicated and expensive . for instance mechanisms must be set in place to ensure that the program is indeed compulsory which means establishing a database of those that have and have not received the vaccine . <eos>
