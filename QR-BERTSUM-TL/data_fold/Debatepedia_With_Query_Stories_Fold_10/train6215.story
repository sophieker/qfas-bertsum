<s> is the caps great for consumers ? <eos>

<s> consumers pay money to governments in taxes . the governments pays this money to the eu which in turn uses this money to keep prices high . scrap the cap would lower prices and be much good for consumers . it is the scrap of the cap which will maximise consumers choice allowing consumers a download choice between local or international traditional or standardised agricultural products . if there is no demands for local produce then it is a complete waste of money to keep local agriculture going artificially produce unwanted goods at tax-payers expense . <eos>
