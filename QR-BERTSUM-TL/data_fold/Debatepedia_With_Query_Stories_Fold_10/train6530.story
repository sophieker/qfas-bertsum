<s> individual vs. collective : does the # nd confer an individual or a collective way to arms ? <eos>

<s> the language of the second amendment creates a situation in which the right to bear arms applies only to the militia . the second amendment reads `` a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed . '' the first clause clearly qualifies any right to bear arms as solely for the purpose of maintaining `` a well regulated militia '' for `` the security of a free state '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> # nd amendment applies only to the collective right of the militia to bears arms <eos>
