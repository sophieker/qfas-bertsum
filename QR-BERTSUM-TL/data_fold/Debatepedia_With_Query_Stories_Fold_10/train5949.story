<s> distinct identity : does tibetan have a distinct regional identity ? <eos>

<s> china has many different group with many different historical cultural geographic and linguistic characteristics . tibet is only another of those groups . why should this warrant that it become independent ? in modern multicultural societies similarities should be rejoicing rather than exploited to dividing a country . <eos>

@highlight

<s> in a multicultural society tibet 's uniqueness does not warrant independence <eos>
