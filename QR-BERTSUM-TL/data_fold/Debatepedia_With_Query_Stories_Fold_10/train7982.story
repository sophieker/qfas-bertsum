<s> mothers ' health : is it important to mother 's health ? <eos>

<s> salma hayek argued : `` i gained a lot of weight i had gestational diabetes . the pregnancy was really difficult for me . i thought as soon as this baby is out i m just going to lose the weight super fast because i m going to breast feed and everybody tells you that if you breastfeed it s going to come out like this it s a lie ! it s not true . except for a couple of exceptions the only reason people lose weight like that when they re breastfeeding it s because they re not eating and they re breastfeeding and this is not good for the baby . you know how they tell you it takes nine months to get it <eos>

@highlight

<s> breastfeeding does not necessarily help women lose weight <eos>
