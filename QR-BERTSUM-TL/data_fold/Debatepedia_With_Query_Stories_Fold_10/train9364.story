<s> self-defense : would a hand-guns ban leave adequate means of self defense ? <eos>

<s> there is little evidence that a handgun is a more effective as a means to self-defence than a rifles or a shotgun . at a minimum there is nothing to suggest that a shotgun and a rifles are ineffective as self-defence weapons . some suggest that a shotgun is actually a superior choice for purpose of self-defence as it is a more devastation weapons to an assailant than a handgun which may only slightly impair an intruder . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rifle and shotguns are as effectiveness as handguns in self-defense <eos>
