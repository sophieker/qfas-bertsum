<s> self-determination : do the islanders have a right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> the fact these people who are mostly white are accusing anyone of stealing land would make a horse laugh . bsas control grew from the province of bsas in # to a nation the size of india in # years annexing much land from the native peoples in particular patagonia . they themselves mounted a campaign of implanting populations in patagonia during the # - # period to seize control of land that was left by the spanish and south american governments for the natives without their consultation . these implanted people many ironically of british decent ( welsh ) are perfectly entitled to self-determination according to the argentine government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the argentine government conquered land from the native peoples in south america years after the british re-establishment prompting hypocrisy <eos>
