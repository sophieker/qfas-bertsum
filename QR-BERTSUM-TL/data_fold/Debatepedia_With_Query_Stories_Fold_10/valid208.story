<s> moon-to-mars : would colonizing the moon aid a mission to mars ? <eos>

<s> gregg easterbrook . `` moon baseless '' . slate . dec. 8 2006 : `` do n't we need a moon base to go to mars ? no ! when george w. bush made his mars-trip speech almost three years ago he said a moon base should be built to support such a mission . this is gibberish . all concept studies of mars flight involve an expedition departing from low-earth orbit and traveling directly to the red planet . stopping at the moon would require fuel to descend to the lunar surface then blast off again which would make any mars mission hugely more expensive . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> colonizing the moon is not a logical step toward mars <eos>
