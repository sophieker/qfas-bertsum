<s> barbarous procedure : is partial-birth abortion a barbarous procedure ? <eos>

<s> on this basis it may be appropriate to conclude that a unborn fetus and a convicted death-row criminal should be treated with a similar level of decency . given that most liberal democracies prohibit violent forms of capital punishment it may then follow that liberal democracies ( and others ) should prohibit the common methods of partial birth abortions on the grounds that they are excessively violent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a ban on partial birth abortions would stop other even more `` gruesome '' forms of late term abortions . <eos>
