<s> negative impact ? has the effect of feminist campaign been negative in society ? <eos>

<s> feminist should recognise that in many profession the unequal representation of women reflects the reason that relatively few women want to work there in the first places rather than the reason that women are discriminate against by employers . if employers feel pressured to accept women over better-qualified men this can cause resentment both among male competitor and among women who do not want to feel they have an unfair advantage . campaigning for women in certain undermines the principle that women can compete on equals terms with men . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many feminist campaigns on issues such as positive discrimination in employment actually damage the women they claims to help . <eos>
