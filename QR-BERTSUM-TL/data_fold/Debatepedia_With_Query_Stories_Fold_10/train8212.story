<s> vandalism : does wikipedia handle vandalism adequately ? <eos>

<s> while most instances of page blanking or the addition of offensive material are soon reverted less obvious vandalism has remained for longer periods . for example a user made several racist edits to martin luther king jr. day that were not reverted for nearly four hours . [ 54 ] columnist sujay kumar commented : `` while wikipedia says that most vandal edits are removed within five minutes some falsities have managed to go unnoticed . an outlandishly fake entry about larry king 's uncontrollable flatulence was posted for a month . '' [ 2 ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> many vandalisms on wikipedia are not corrected for months <eos>
