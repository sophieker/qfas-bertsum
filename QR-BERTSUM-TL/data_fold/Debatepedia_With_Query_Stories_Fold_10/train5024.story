<s> global warming : can hydropower help cuts emissions fight global warming ? <eos>

<s> forests and plant life are important dioxide sinks sucking co # ( a greenhouse gas and contributor to globally warming ) from the air in the processes of photosynthesis . forests are therefore important in the fight against globally warming . killed trees by cutting them down to make room for dams and their infrastructure by flooding them upstream under a dam 's reservoir or by diminish downstream nutrient flow all eliminates these important dioxide sinks . this only contributing to the greenhouse gas effect and globally warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> dams eliminating forests that absorb co # from the atmosphere . <eos>
