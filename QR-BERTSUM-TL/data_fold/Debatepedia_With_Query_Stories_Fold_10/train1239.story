<s> security : are pre- # borders best way to security ? <eos>

<s> ehud olmert : `` we can never totally return to the indefensible pre- # borders ... we simply can not afford to make israel [ # miles ] wide again at its center . we ca n't allow the palestinians to be a couple [ miles ] from [ tel aviv 's ] ben gurion airport in the age of shoulder-fire missiles with the capacity to shoot down jumbo jets . but that does n't mean we must remain in every corner of the west bank or in gaza where fewer than # # jews living next to # . # million palestinians have been protected by twice as many soldiers . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> pre- # borders would be too insecure and dangerous <eos>
