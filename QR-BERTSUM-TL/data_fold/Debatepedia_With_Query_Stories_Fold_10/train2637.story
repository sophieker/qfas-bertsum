<s> reanalysed evidence : should cases be subject to a reanalysis of the evidence after the firs trial ? <eos>

<s> vast improvements in the technology of crime-solving have occurred in recent times . dna testing voice identification technology facial mapping techniques that reveal faces underneath masks - all can now solve case and show guilt in individuals who escape from punishment occurred only because of a lack of satisfactory evidence . for example in # when hanratty stood trial for the a # murder ( a gruesome offences where the abused victim was shot in her car and left to die on the motorway ) semen stains on the victim s underwear could not be investigated use the technology of the day . he was convicted anyway on the facts but if he hadn t been and thank to advances in technology the sperm turns out <eos>

@highlight

<s> newest techniques make a reanalysis of evidence possible later on : <eos>
