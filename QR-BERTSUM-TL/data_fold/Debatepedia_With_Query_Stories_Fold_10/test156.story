<s> economics : is the price of full-body scanners reasonable/worth-it ? <eos>

<s> they can cost around $ 150 000 each . this is very expensive when considering that any proposal to have a comprehensive system of full-body scanners in nations internationally would require hundreds of these machines . this is particularly true when you consider that many of these machines must be placed in an airport in order to maintain short security lines .
