<s> global warming : is solar power key to reducing emissions and fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> because photovoltaic energy can not supply energy at night and is depend on good weather it requires back-up sources of energy to fill the gaps . these back-up sources are often coal-based since coal is the predominant fuel driving electricity production . this means that photovoltaic power 's inconsistency has positive consequences for the environment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> inconsistent solar energy requires back-up sources ( carbon-based ) . <eos>
