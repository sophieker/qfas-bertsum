<s> environment : is offshore drilling consistent with environmental preservation ? <eos>

<s> drills were made to do three things . drill drain and devastate . drills drill for oil drill oil while devastating the area around it . no matter how advanced technology is used there will be accidents . even after years of using electricity and making safety regulations and devices there are still thousands of electrocution cases each either . this proves that even if advanced safety measures are taking there will be accidents and tragedies . the drill is just like this . no matter how safe it is made to preventing accidents it will have accidents . also the drill draining and burning it causes is enough to devastate the ecosystem . why try to deny the truth ? <eos>
