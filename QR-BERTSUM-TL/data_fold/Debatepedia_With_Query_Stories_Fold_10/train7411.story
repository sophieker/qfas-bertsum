<s> democracy : is the superdelegate system sufficiently representative and democratic ? <eos>

<s> many arguing that the superdelegate system is undemocratic because superdelegates are not binding to voting in accordance with the electotrate 's will . the problems with this argument is that it does not considering the fact that most superdelegates are elected representatives of the electorate . they are therefore representative to some degrees of the electorate . as such the process is fairly democratic . <eos>
