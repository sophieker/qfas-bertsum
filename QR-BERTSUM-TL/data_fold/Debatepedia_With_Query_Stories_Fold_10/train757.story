<s> ceo pay : is constraining ceo pay with progressive taxes a good idea ? <eos>

<s> the presumption under a progressive tax system is that society can determine what is too low and too high of an income . yet this is a highly subjective question for society and government to be involved in . the markets are a far better suited for answering this question . <eos>

<s> progressives wrongly presume society can determine proper income <eos>
