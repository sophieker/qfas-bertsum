<s> should a government have the right to draft its citizens into military service ? <eos>

<s> at it 's very core the government 's duty is to protect the rights of it 's citizens from those that will violate them such as criminals or foreign invaders . if this principle is accepted then all the other augment in favor of drafting other then national defense ( training for real life rites of passage nationalism and loyalty employment etc ) will automatically become irrelevant since they are not things that are within the purpose of the government and any interference into those matters will be a violation of their proper role . and in the case of national defense if a country is popular and supported by their own citizens than it should have no lack of volunteers to defend the ideals and principles <eos>

@highlight

<s> conscription is a violation of the proper function of government . <eos>
