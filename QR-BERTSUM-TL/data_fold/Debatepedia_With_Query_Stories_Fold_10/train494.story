<s> identity : do id cards help citizens upholding their identity ? <eos>

<s> we should be moving toward independent separable access key so any one key may be retired or revoked without affect others . for example a senior whose visions is too poor for driving may but need to money a check ; losing access to driving should not think losing access to checking . <eos>

@highlight

<s> one 's identities should not be linking to access keys such as a driver 's license . <eos>
