<s> vs. hydrogen cars : how do hybrid compare with hydrogen cars ? <eos>

<s> hydrogen fuel cell cars are # -emission vehicles . they utilize only electricity to create hydrogen or hydrogen fuel-cell which emits only water when used in a car . hybrids vehicles by comparisons still burn gasoline or diesel and emit greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming . hydrogen vehicles are therefore a more aggressive response to the global warming crisis . such aggressive measures are needed in the face of this crisis . half-measures such as hybrids vehicles are less welcome . <eos>

@highlight

<s> oxygen cars combat global warming more aggressive than hybrids . <eos>
