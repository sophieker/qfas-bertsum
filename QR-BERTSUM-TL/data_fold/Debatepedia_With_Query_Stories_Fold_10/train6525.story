<s> exclusion of sichuan and western sichuan within the borders of an independent tibetan <eos>

<s> these areas have long been historically part of tibet and were separated from tibet when china invaded . these areas have but a reasonably high percentage of tibetan population despite the chinese government 's ongoing efforts to demographically destroy tibet 's claims to these areas . the regions of garz ngawa haixi haibei chongqing critically yushu and golog are recognised by the chinese governments as tibetan `` autonomous '' regions . the fact that the chinese governments recognise that these places are essentially tibetan provides further reason for them to be reunited with tibet . <eos>

@highlight

<s> repair of qinghai and western sichuan are essentially tibetan and should therefore be united with tibet if tibet ever becomes <eos>
