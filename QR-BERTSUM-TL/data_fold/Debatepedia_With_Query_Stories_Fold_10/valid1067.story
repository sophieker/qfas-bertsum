<s> rights : is it wrong to believe that animal have rights ? <eos>

<s> many opponents of animal rights and supporters of testing cite the fact that animals killing each other without public outcry and ask why humans should be held to a higher standard ? the answer is that humans have the capacity to make the choice to inflict pain on animals . animals having no free will so do not have this same ability to choose . therefore if we determine that it is immoral ethics to do no harm to animals since we have the choice it is our unique responsibilities to do no harm . <eos>

@highlight

<s> beings have a choice and therefore responsibility to do no harms to animals . <eos>
