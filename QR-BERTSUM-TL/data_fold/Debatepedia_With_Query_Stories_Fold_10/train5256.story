<s> education : is compulsory service good for education ? <eos>

<s> ilya somin . `` why mandatory 'national service ' proposals target the young . '' volokh conspiracy . september 24th 2007 : `` at this point i know some moralists will claim that the young `` deserve '' any political setbacks they suffer because they do n't participate in politics enough . such arguments overlook the obvious fact that many of the political disadvantages of the poor ( e.g . - lack of money lack of access to political office lack of experience ) are ones that they ca n't easily offset . and whatever the validity of the general view that the young should spend more time on political activity i hope we can agree that forced labor is not a proper punishment for spending too little time on politics .

<s> mandatory service unjustified to increase political engagement . <eos>
