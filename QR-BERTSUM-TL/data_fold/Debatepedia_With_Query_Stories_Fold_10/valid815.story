<s> environment : does a profit-driven society help the environment ? <eos>

<s> as companies and individuals are concerned about their current financial profit they are effectively harming our environment . and contrary to economy the environment can hardly be restored . we are exacerbating our natural resources we are reluctant to fight global warming and these decisions are driven by the care for profit . this clearly is unsustainable and wrong . <eos>

@highlight

<s> environment and economy is not a zero-sum game . <eos>
