<s> moral : is it morally right to expand the eu ? <eos>

<s> current eu policies ( e.g . on global trade the environment ) reflect the interests of its members effectively a rich states club ; it is not in the interests of these states or their citizens to dilute the present relative homogeneity of interests with several poorer nations with different priorities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> mixing rich and poor states in eu mixes interests . <eos>
