<s> other countries : do other countries have official languages ? <eos>

<s> many people today believe that the us is the `` # '' country in the world in several important ways ; perhaps being *different* from countries with an official national language is one of our advantages . it certainly fits with america 's inclusive history and culture . the united states has never been known to follow . why should it do so by adopting english as its official language ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> no official language makes us unique internationally . <eos>
