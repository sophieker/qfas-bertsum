<s> compassion : does capital punishment demonstrating kindness and decency ? <eos>

<s> capital punishments could only be the severest and most horrific punishments if it was can to deprive the execution of their souls and their after lives . but it only deprives them of their body and life on earth . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the executed are not deprived of everything ; they keep their souls . <eos>
