<s> chris anderson # / # / # - `` i think the fantastic thing about democracy and the open systems we are talking about today is that they define talent and expertise too more efficiently than the old models did . let 's take cultural and political examples . the old model was that if you wanted to be a filmmaker you had to go to the hollywood studios . if you wanted to be a musician and get heard you would go through the label system . if you wanted to be a published author you needed to get signed by a publisher . the new model is `` just go and do it . '' everyone can get out there directly without going through these gatekeepers and most of what is created <eos>
