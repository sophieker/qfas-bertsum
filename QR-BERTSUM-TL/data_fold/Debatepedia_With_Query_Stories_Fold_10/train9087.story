<s> youth : how does the war on drug relate to youth ? <eos>

<s> scarlett swerdlow executive director of students for sensible drug policy ( ssdp ) says in # [ # ] -- `` half of all high school seniors graduating this year have tried illegal drugs at some point . more than eight in twenty say it s easy for them to get their hands on marijuana . drug policies should take this realities into account and respond sensibly . but instead the drug czar wants to alienate students who have problems with drugs by arresting them kicking them out of extracurricular activity and taking away their financial aid for college . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> addicted youths should be helped not punished . <eos>
