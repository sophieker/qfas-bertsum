<s> stig jagerskiold in # in which he argues that the right of return was specifically as an individuals and not a collective right : `` ... [ it ] is specifically to apply to persons asserting an individuals right . there was no intention here to address the claims of masses of people who have been refugees as a byproduct of war or by political transfers of territory or population such as the relocation of ethnic germans from northern europe during and after the second world war the flight of the palestinians from what became israel or the movements of jews from the arab countries . '' [ # ] <eos>
