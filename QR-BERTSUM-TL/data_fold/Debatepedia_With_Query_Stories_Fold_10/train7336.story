<s> ambiguity : is `` free speech '' too ambiguous a concept requiring government clarification ? <eos>

<s> many political theorists argue that checks and balances need to be put in place in order to prevent governmental abuse . the right to freedom of speech is too importance to leave in the hands of government . an independent judicial or politically-independent body for evaluating such circumstances is the only place that can efficiently guarantee . <eos>

@highlight

<s> government can not be trusted as arbiter of free speech ; it is a god-given and inalienable right . <eos>
