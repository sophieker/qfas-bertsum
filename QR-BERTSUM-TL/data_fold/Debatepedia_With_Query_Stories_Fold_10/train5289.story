<s> consumption : would legalization decrease drug-consumption ? <eos>

<s> `` how to stop the drug wars . '' the economist . mar # th # : `` fear [ of legalisation ] is based in large part on the presumption that more people would take drug under a legal regime . that presumption may be wrong . there is no correlation between the harshness of drug law and the incidence of drug-taking : citizens living under tough regimes ( notably america but also britain ) take more drug not fewer . embarrassed drug warriors blame this on allegedly cultural differences but even in fairly similar countries tough rules make little difference to the number of addicts : harsh sweden and more liberal norway have precisely the same addiction rates . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> drug prohibition does not correlate with increased using <eos>
