<s> meritocracy : does the election of judges fit with the idea of a meritocracy ? <eos>

<s> democracies even representative have nothing to uphold other than letting the voters have a voice . by it 's very nature a democracy would do nothing to preserve a precedence on any sort of merit or qualifications . what 's even worse is the fact that voters care very little about merit and any elections show it . there is no real correlation of experience to votes won if one looks back at an history of elections . to allow for a meritocracy to occur with choosing judges people who actually appreciate merit must be the deciders . those people are no the average voters because as winston churchill once said `` the best argument agaisnt democracy is a five-minute consversation with the average voter . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> democracies have no obligation to merit . <eos>
