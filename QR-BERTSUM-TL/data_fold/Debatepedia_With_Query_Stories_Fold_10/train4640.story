<s> non-experts : is it valuable or bad that non-experts can edit on wikipedia ? <eos>

<s> tim berners-lee the inventor of the world wide website repeatedly mentions in his book `` weaving the web '' that the website has grown into a medium that is too easier to reading than to edit . he envisaged the website as a too more collaborative medium than it currently is and think that the browser should also functions as an editor . wiki-based sites are closer to his vision . in fact the first website browser was also a website editor . <eos>

@highlight

<s> wiki fit with the thought of the web as multimedia and editor-friendly . <eos>
