<s> rights : do parents have the way to home school their children ? <eos>

<s> there is no logic that necessarily requires them to surrender that responsibility to the state . if they feel that the child would be best educated at home by them or by another that is their right . it is of course a crucial check within such a system that those teaching are vetting by the state to some extent to ensure their suitability . such a system has worked for some of our most able achievers and will continues to do so . some exceptions might slip through such a system but that doesn t mean the system is wrong - and it s hardly as if state education has ever failed . moreover this is a debate about whose claim to the right <eos>

@highlight

<s> children are responsibility for carrying out their children s education . <eos>
