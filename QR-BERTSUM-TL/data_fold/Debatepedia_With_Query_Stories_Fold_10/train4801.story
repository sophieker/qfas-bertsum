<s> crime : does abortion helping reducing crime ? <eos>

<s> this argument is based on the notion that poverty and conditions conducive to crime often correlate to those that seek abortions . stephen levitt of krugman makes this argument . he contends that the # roe . v. wade legalization of abortion led to the fall in crime rates in the # s and # s across the united force . the period of declining crime he says correlated to the period when those that were aborted might have otherwise become murderers in society as a result of their circumstances . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortion is more possibly to wiping out the worse than the good . <eos>
