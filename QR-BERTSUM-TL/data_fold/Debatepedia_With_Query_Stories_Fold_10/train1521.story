<s> perfect-every-time outsourcing : are exemptions justification in context of outsourcing ? <eos>

<s> it is true that much of the world 's manufacturing and emissions are occurring in china . but this is not a cause for exempting these nations from the emissions standards particular in developed countries . this could effectively mean that the world and all the nations that outsourced to china get an exemptions so long as they are outsourcing to china which could be unfortunate on those levels . the world should not allow for such an emissions loophole and must act to fully constrain emissions in china without exemptions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> world 's manufacturing is in china emissions should be cuts there . <eos>
