<s> patentability ? are gene sequences patentable under existing law ? <eos>

<s> biodiversity of this planet is the common heritage of humankind . living organisms are no one 's inventions and therefore never be proprietary and put under private control . living organisms should not be placed on the same level as human technnical inventions . patent may make access to genetic resources more difficult and in some cases blocks that access altogether . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gene are part of nature so should not be patented <eos>
