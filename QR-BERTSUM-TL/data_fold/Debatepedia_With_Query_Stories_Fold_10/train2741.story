<s> culture : is bullfights a culture creative practice ? <eos>

<s> international movement against bullfights : `` the truth is if a creatures suffers then there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration . all animals are sentient beings that experience joy happiness fear and pain in the same way that human beings do . we can have no right whatsoever to make them suffer for our `` enjoyment '' . if any torture inflicted to an animal deserves condemnation bullfights are the worst kind of torture since they are performed solely in the name of entertainment . we must end the animals ' torture and stop these shows of brutality and violence . it is too large a step from the intentional wrongful of pain on an animal to the torture and killing <eos>

@highlight

<s> inflicting pain for the purposes of entertainment is wrong . <eos>
