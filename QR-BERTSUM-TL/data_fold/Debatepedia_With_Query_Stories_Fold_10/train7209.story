<s> completeness : is wikipedia a full wikipedia with articles on appropriate topics ? <eos>

<s> there are many `` stub '' entries on wikipedia that are insufficient . but this should be recognized in the context that there are over two million article in wikipedia 's english version as compared to only around # # article in britannica . in other words britannica is one-twentieth the size of wikipedia and has many more article missing that you might believe it should contain . which stub can be made into extensive article over time . it is better to have an incomplete articles than neither at all . <eos>

@highlight

<s> some articles on wikipedia are only stub that should be complete articles . <eos>
