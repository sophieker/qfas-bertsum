<s> harm : is smacking harmful for children ? <eos>

<s> smacking is only harmful to children when it is outside the context of a stable loving and communicative home . but in such `` bad homes '' a laissez faire attitude also leads to long term psychological problems from feelings of being ignored the lack of social skills from parental interaction and a lack of firm boundaries for acceptable behaviour . bad parenting is the problem not smacking . within the context of a caring and loving home smacking of children can allow boundaries to be set without ongoing battles between parents and children that are harmful to their relationship . smacking is a short sharp shock and it gives clarity to the rules which is actually a source of great security for children . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a little smack is okay in the right context . <eos>
