<s> democracy : does direct democracy uphold democratic principles ? <eos>

<s> the formation of political parties is considered by some to be a `` necessary evil '' of representative democracy where combined resources are often needed to get candidates elected . however such parties mean that individual representatives must compromise their own values and those of the electorate in order to fall in line with the party platform . in direct democracy political parties have virtually no effect as people do not need to conform with popular opinions .

<s> political parties are unfortunate consequence of rep. democracy . <eos>
