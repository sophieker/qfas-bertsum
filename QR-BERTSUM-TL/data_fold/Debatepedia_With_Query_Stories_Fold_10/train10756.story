<s> economics : what are the sociology of carbon capturing and sequestration ? <eos>

<s> `` do we really need carbon capture and storage ? . '' rsc : `` a key piece of tsouris and aaron 's argument is that for a given investment we would have twice as much impacts on co # emissions reduction by investing in wind energy than we would have by installing ccs . in a deft move he has admitted that prices be be volatile but using the most cost estimates today give this # : # leverage for wind ( nuclear is even better ) . balderdash ! this is akin to comparing whale oil and mineral oil prices in the late # th century . whale oil was cheaper than mineral oil meaning mineral oil required an initial fillip from government . but shortly thereafter the industry took off and prices fell drastically <eos>

@highlight

<s> ccs will become cost-effective as it scales <eos>
