<s> self-defense - is self-defense a good reason for gun ownership ? <eos>

<s> the supreme court case warren v district of columbia estabished that there is no right to police protection and that there is no contract between the individual and local police . in short the court has ruled that each person is responsible for his/her own protection . <eos>

@highlight

<s> individuals are responsible to defend themselves as police are not . <eos>
