<s> teaching the controversy : should the controversy be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> many groups contend that evolution directly instructs that genesis is wrong . if this is true than allowing only the teaching of evolutionary theory directly undermines a religious doctrine . young impressionable students are more likely to believe such teachings . this should not be the case . public schools should allow for the teaching of all salient doctrines and theories . no favor should be given one way or another . this principle is known as `` freedom of religion '' and is protected in the united states by the establishment clause . this clause ensures that no favor or dis-favor be given to any religious doctrine yet this is precisely what is happening if creationism is prevented by the state from being taught in schools . <eos>

@highlight

<s> preventing the teaching of creationism violates freedom of religion . <eos>
