<s> self-determination : do the islanders have a right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> argentina does not recognize the right to self-determination of the inhabitants of the malvinas/falklands citing that they are not aboriginal and were brought to replace the argentine population that argentina claims was expelled after the re-establishment of british rule in # . in other words britain illegitimately settled the falklands and now is trying to give these settlers the right to determine their future which would obviously favor keeping the malvinas under the british flag . it is illegitimate therefore to use `` self-determination '' to settle this dispute . argentina 's historical and territorial/geographical claims to the islands are paramount . <eos>

@highlight

<s> brits now dominate the malvinas ; self-determination can not apply <eos>
