<s> democracy : does direct democratic uphold democracy principles ? <eos>

<s> given that voters decide on single issues instead of a package of policies that might not fully be in the voters ' interests the people are freer to choose what is the best for them . in a representative democracy however these package deals are usually comprehensive programmes that are altering after the elections are held . that means that politicians from the party that forms a government are free to choose which part of each package works the best -- for them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> direct democracy checks the tendency towards package deals . <eos>
