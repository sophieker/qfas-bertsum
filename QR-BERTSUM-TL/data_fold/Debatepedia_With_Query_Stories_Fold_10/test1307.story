<s> self-improvement : does wikipedia 's models often towards refinement and perfection ? <eos>

<s> articles seem to be getting rapidly more polished . articles have a tendency to get slowly better and better particularly if there is one person working on an article with reasonable regularity ( in that case others have a tendency to help ) . there are some articles we can all point to that started out life mediocre at most and are now at least somewhat better than mediocre . now suppose this project lasting for those years and attracts those more people as seems perfectly reasonable to assume . then how could articles not be burnished to a scintillating luster ? also how could the model itself not continue to evolve and improve ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> wiki is a work in progress and self-correcting . <eos>
