<s> punishment : can torture be justified as an added form of punishment ? <eos>

<s> - if some terrorist have inflicted a massive amount of pain and suffering are n't they due a proportional amount of punishment . is n't this their due desert ? or at least should we flinch at the notion that the most evil of them are experiencing only a tiny fraction of the pain and suffering that they have caused or intend to cause ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> some terrorists may deserve a little extra punishment for the death and misery they 've caused . <eos>
