<s> dominion : do humans not have kingdom over animal ( and a right to eating them ) ? <eos>

<s> but if we apply the notion of `` dominion '' and deny animals rights the principle of `` dominion '' should be applied in a way that requires humans to see themselves as `` stewards '' not dominant exploiters . as `` stewards '' inflicting suffering on animals by eating them is unacceptable . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` dominion '' gives humans stewards ; no right to harm/exploit animal <eos>
