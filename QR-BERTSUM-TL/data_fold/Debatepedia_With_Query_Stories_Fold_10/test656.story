<s> jennifer fields . `` is law school for you ? '' : `` while lawyers do have the ability to affect change on a case-by-case basis it is important to realize ( as i eventually did ) that there is a tremendous amount that lawyers ca n't change . deborah aaron author of what can you do with a law degree ? a lawyer 's guide to career alternatives inside outside & around the law emphasizes that law school may not be the best way to make your dream of changing society come true . `` it 's a very expensive way to contribute `` she said . `` law school is so expensive and public interest jobs pay so little that you ca n't afford to go out and change the world and do good .
