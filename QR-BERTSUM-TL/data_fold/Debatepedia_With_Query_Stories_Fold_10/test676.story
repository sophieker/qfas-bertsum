<s> democracy : is the superdelegate system sufficiently representatives and democratic ? <eos>

<s> this argument generally rests on the notion that voter should decide the direction of elections and that superdelegates are primarily responsible for flocking to the support of the candidate that the voter select . the purposes of this is to providing the nominee a good delegate margin to strengthen their legitimacy as the nominee and to unify the party up them . but in # delegates have been committing before the voting is done . <eos>

@highlight

<s> superdelegates are erroneously commit before vote is done <eos>
