<s> global warming : can biofuels help combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> it is argued that burning biofuels does not in the end release c02 into the atmosphere because the co2 released is canceled out by the co2 that is consumed by the plants to make the biofuel . yet would n't it be better to plant trees and other plant-matter and not burn it at all ? this would draw more c02 from the atmosphere and actually reduce the level of co2 in the atmosphere thus helping reverse global warming rather than merely have a neutral impact . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is better to plant trees and leave them . <eos>
