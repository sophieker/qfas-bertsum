<s> offensive ? is the ground zero mosque defensive or respectful ? <eos>

<s> gabriel winant . `` ground zero mosque touches off right-wing panic . '' salon.com . may # th # : `` the mosque is already just a few blocks away in tribeca but has overgrown its current space . rashid says that he hopes that having a moderate mosque so near ground zero can sending a message of tolerance and peace . '' the point here is that this was not a mosque out of nowhere but rather a mosque that already existed blocks away and which is simply being moved to a new location a couple of blocks closed to ground zero where a new building can fit the growing demands for the mosque . <eos>

@highlight

<s> mosque is not newest in higher manhattan ; it is simply moving . <eos>
