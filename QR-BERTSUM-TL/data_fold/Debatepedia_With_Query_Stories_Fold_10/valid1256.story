<s> crisis : which is the greater crisis poverty or warming change ? <eos>

<s> the globally south is a body of people living in abject poverty mostly near the equator and in the southern hemisphere . globally warming threatens to drastically reduce rains fall in these areas of the world which would have a devastating effect on water resources crop production and general economic productivity in these regions . the worst effects of sea-level rise are also likely to occur in high lying coastal areas of greatest concern in densely populated south east asia india bangladesh and parts of africa . overall thus climate change is one of the greatest threats to globally poverty . <eos>

@highlight

<s> climate changing will disproportionately harm impoverished states . <eos>
