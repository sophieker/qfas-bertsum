<s> should fair use exist ? <eos>

<s> `` fair use '' involves drawing a line in the sand between what is fair use of copyrighted content and what is not . the problem is that defining this line is as much art as anything else . the context of the use matters greatly such as whether the user intends to use the content for commercial and non-commercial purposes . the problem is that the flexibility of the definition causes many copyright holders to sue even if their case is not too strong . this is expensive for all parties involved and ultimately more costly overall than it is worth . <eos>

@highlight

<s> difficulties in defining fair use leads to wasteful court-battles . <eos>
