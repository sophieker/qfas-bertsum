<s> broke treaties : do modern nations owed indigenous people a debt for breaking treaties ? <eos>

<s> in almost all instances aboriginals and settlers made treaties . those treaties were violated by the settlers in an effort to further their own colonial aims . to protect those historic agreements and to right those wrongs aboriginals must be treated differently than the rest of society . in australia and canadian the courts have held that aboriginal peoples have the right to claim title in specific circumstances . equally in canadian aboriginal groups can seek certain rights if they can proving the historic existence of that right . <eos>

<s> aboriginals deserve differential treatment as compensation for violating treaties : <eos>
