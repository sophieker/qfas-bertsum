<s> life lessons : do child beauty contests teach good life lessons ? <eos>

<s> kate sullivan . `` should child beauty pageants be banned altogether ? '' allure.com . may 26th 2011 : `` anything good that a pageant does for a child something else does it better . as a former basketball player and competitive cheerleader ( yes it 's a sport ) i know that competition and the wins and losses that went with it educated me about the real world . but it 's exactly because i did those self-esteem building activities that i know there are options for parents who want confident happy kids . in a childhood that 's full of opportunities for soccer games and spelling bees why ca n't we just put away the self-tanner and baby high heels ?
