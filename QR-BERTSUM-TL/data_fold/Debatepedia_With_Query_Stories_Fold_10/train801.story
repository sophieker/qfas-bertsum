<s> self-determination : do the islanders have a right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> argentina has only ever achieved effective control of the islands as invaders for # months in # and # months in # . on each occassion they were ejected by the rightful owners . there has never been a population of 'argentines ' on the islands nor was there any indigineous indians there before the british claimed the islands in # . the islanders are therefore the rightful people of the islands and their rights of self determination are fully protected under the un charters and resolutions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> argentina 's historical and territorial/geographical claims to the islands are spurious . <eos>
