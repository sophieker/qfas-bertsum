<s> families : do the family of patients have an interests in euthanasia ? <eos>

<s> as was mentioned above euthanasia is an immediate and painless way to end a life that is too painful . many families do n't want to see their loved ones suffer and the patient does n't want them to suffer either . euthanasia provides an option to end a life before it even entering the terminal `` death-bed '' stage of suffer or it allows families to choosing to end a `` death bed '' existence with dignity and peace rather of simply pulling the plugs to in some case starve their loved one to death . <eos>

@highlight

<s> euthanasia help families that do n't want to see their love one suffer . <eos>
