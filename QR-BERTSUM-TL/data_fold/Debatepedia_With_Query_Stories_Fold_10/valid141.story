<s> female interests : does polygamous benefit the women that engaging in it ? <eos>

<s> `` polygamy means to protect to take care of and maintain the wife . he told one social workers that polygamy was not illicit . but suharto prabhupad explained only if the man is able to maintain his wives . otherwise if he can not maintain another husband then to want another husband is not probably for protection . then all he wants is to have sex only . that is irresponsible and thus clandestine sex . but if a man can not maintain one husband but has sex with her and gets her pregnant this is not good . who will maintain the woman and child ? then it is irresponsible sex and that is illicit . but if the man can correctly maintain additional husband then it is not clandestine <eos>

@highlight

<s> polygamous is only appropriate when a man can provide for more than one wife <eos>
