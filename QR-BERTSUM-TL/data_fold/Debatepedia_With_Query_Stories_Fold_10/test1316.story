<s> mongols/yuan dynasty ( 1271-1368 ) : did tibet maintain independence in this period ? <eos>

<s> in the past 700 years subsequent chinese governments - ming dynasty qing dynasty republic of china and people 's republic of china - have all succeeded the yuan dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty and de facto power over tibet . this creates a sufficient historical basis for china to claim sovereignty over tibet . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tibet has been part of china since 13th century mongol invasions <eos>
