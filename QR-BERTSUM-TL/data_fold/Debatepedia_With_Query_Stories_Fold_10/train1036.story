<s> rarity : does the rarity of bad calls matter ? <eos>

<s> events like galarraga 's perfect game are rare ( although not that rare ) . but there rarity is not an argument against instant replay . the rare and very important call is hugely important . it is important to the fans important to the players and important to the legitimacy of baseball . ensuring that these events are called correctly and fairly is well worth any of the much smaller costs that might come with instituting an instant replay system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> getting rare/important calls right justifies replay . <eos>
