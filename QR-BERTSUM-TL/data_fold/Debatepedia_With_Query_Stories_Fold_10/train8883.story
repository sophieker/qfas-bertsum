<s> righting past wrongs : should artifacts be returned to their nation of origin in order to `` right past wrongs '' ? <eos>

<s> although some art treasures may have been acquired illegally the findings for this is often ambiguous . lords elgin s bribes were the common way of facilitating any business in the ottoman empire and do not undermine britain s solid legal claim to the parthenon marbles based upon a written contract made by the international-recognised officials in athens at the time . and while some benin bronzes were undoubtedly looted other colonial trophies were readily sold to the emperor powers surely some were made specifically for the europe market .

@highlight

<s> it is not always clearly how artifacts were acquired ( illegally or otherwise ) making it impossible to determine a basis for <eos>
