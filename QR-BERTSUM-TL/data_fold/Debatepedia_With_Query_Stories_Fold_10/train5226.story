<s> lftr reactors : are liquid fluoride plutonium reactors ( lftr ) a good idea ? <eos>

<s> molten fluoride salt proposed as a solvent/primary 'progressive transfer agent in lftr reactors are highly reactive to many solids ( e.g . corrosive to many metals ) especially when heated to high temperature inside a work reactor [ # ] . this puts high demands on and severely limits the choice of materials used for the reactor vessels plumbing and other parts of the machinery bringing many difficulties and intricacies along . <eos>
