<s> nature : are zoos unnatural and subsequently immoral ? <eos>

<s> call it what it is . zoos exist to entertain and amuse the paying customer . they are about serving humans not serving animals . the debate should focus on whether this is justified not on whether zoos are `` designed to help animals '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> zoos exist simply to amuse the paying public . <eos>
