<s> decency : is bullfights good or does it verge on animals torture ? <eos>

<s> robert elms . `` end bullfighting and you give in to the neutering forces of accepted taste . '' the independent . july # st # > `` those who see bullfighting as cruel are of course right . it is cruel that man should breed and killing animals for his enjoyment whether as a dinner or a dance . but to my thinking the life of an iberian fighting bull a thoroughbred animal which lives to a minimum age of four roaming wild feasting on spain 's finest pasture never even seeing a man on foot is far superior to that of the many thousands of british bulls whose far shorter lives are spent entirely in factory conditions and killed in grim abattoirs so that we can eat beefburgers . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> lives of bullfighting bull more decent than factory bull . <eos>
