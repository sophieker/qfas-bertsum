<s> militia : does the # nd amendment secured an individual right to form an independant militia ? <eos>

<s> another of the primary purposes of the second amendments of the constitution was to protect against domestic tyranny . the reason for this is based in large part in history but it remains relevant today . at the time of the draft of the constitution another of the greatest fears was that a statesmanlike figure would emerge in american government or that the government would simply become despotic and tyrannical like britain was believed to have become leading up to the revolutionary war . hedging against the emerging of a tyranny in america therefore was of primary concern . the second amendments was designed to ensuring that the people were fully empowered with the threat of violence to combat the emerging of a tyrant . <eos>
