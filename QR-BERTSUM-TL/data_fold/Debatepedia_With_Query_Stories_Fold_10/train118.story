<s> politicizing olympics : is it appropriate to politicize the olympics with boycotts ? <eos>

<s> even if china is not abiding by humans rights standards this should not be a factor in whether or not the olympic games should be held there and/or whether state should attend . the olympic games have historically been a nonpolitical arenas of sports . attendance should not be seen in the political context but merely in the context of national athletes competing in sports . if politics are allowed to enter as criteria in hosting and attending the games many unfortunately demands or conditions could be made by states . the games would become whole of the politicized geopolitical context . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the olympic game should not be politicized <eos>
