<s> students : do teachers strike have benefit on the students ? <eos>

<s> most of the time when teachers strike it is because students needs have not been met . when teachers strike the government usually does n't like it because nobody is teach the children so they listen to the teachers to avoid it happenning again . teachers are the only trained education professionals in societies and as such it is vitally important for students and the community that they have at least some input into how education systems are run . if governments create policies or enact legislation without consulting the very people who running the schools on a daily basis then a strike becomes the only way in which these valuable voices can contribute to the development of education reforms . in an ideal world <eos>
