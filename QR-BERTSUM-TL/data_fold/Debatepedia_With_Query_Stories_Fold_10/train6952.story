<s> authority : do un-elected judge lack the sufficient authority and legitimacy ? <eos>

<s> elections offering a certain amounts of legitimacy . they conferring the power of the people to a government 's rules by and for the people . lacking such electoral legitimacy the judicial branch lacking authority . this is a problem in a governments that demands checking and balances from co-equal branches . indeed in the united states the judicial branch is considered the weakest of the three branches of government . but should this be the case in a governments established on the precepts of co-equal branches ? an elected judiciary would be a more powerful judiciary and thus provide for stronger checking and balances and stronger governance . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unelected judges lack jurisdiction need by co-equal branch of govt . <eos>
