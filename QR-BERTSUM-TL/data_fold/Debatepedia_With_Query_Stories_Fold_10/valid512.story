<s> is terrorism justifiable if it represents the only meaning to counter an authoritarian regime ? <eos>

<s> alternatives such as constructive engagement or economic sanctions are preferable and much more likely to resulting in eventual liberalisation of the regime albeit slowly . the examples of eastern europe in # and yugoslavia in # show that even in supposedly hopeless cases change can come through popular action sometimes quickly and without great violence . cambodia in # afghanistan in # and iraq in # all seeing dictatorships quickly overthrown by internal forces . <eos>

@highlight

<s> to liberalize a regime there are better ways than terrorism . <eos>
