<s> analogous services : is universally healthcare care analogous to other governments services ? <eos>

<s> while many those compare health care to cops stations and fire stations they are not the same services . health care is partly about providing a services to the individual that compensates often for poor individual choices . fire stations and cops departments on the other hand provide services to a community and focus on protecting individuals against thing they have no control over ( crime and fires ) . the differences are very significant in regards to what the state is obligated to provide . the state is obligated to protect citizens from one-another . but the state is not obligated to protect citizens from themselves . universal health care is wrongheaded to the extent that it involves protecting individuals from themselves . <eos>

@highlight

<s> healthcare problem are more about individual choices than fires and crime . <eos>
