<s> users : is graduated response considerate to users ? <eos>

<s> the recordings industry association of america and the action picture association of america have sued illegal downloaders for billions of dollars over the years claiming up to $ # # in damages for a single illegal download . this is excessive and overly taxing on consumers . the most important element of graduated response is that it avoids these draconian lawsuits in favors of a warning system and then a far less costly sanctions system . <eos>
