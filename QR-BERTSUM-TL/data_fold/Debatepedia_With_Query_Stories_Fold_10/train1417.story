<s> morality : is hunt consistent with humans morality and dignity ? <eos>

<s> many opponent of animal rights and supporters of testing cite the fact that animals killing each other without private outcry and ask why humans should be held to a higher standard ? the answer is that humans have the capacity to make the choices to inflicting pain on animals . animals having no free will so do not have this same ability to choose . therefore if we determining that it is morally ethical to do no harm to animals since we have the choices it is our unique responsibilities to do no harm . <eos>

@highlight

<s> killed animals should be viewed as equivalents to killed humans <eos>
