<s> universal jurisdiction : is this icc principle legitimate ? <eos>

<s> henry kissinger . `` the pitfalls of universal jurisdiction : risking judicial tryanny '' . foreign affairs . aug. # - `` the doctrine of universal jurisdiction asserts that some crime are so heinous that their perpetrators should not escape justice by invoking doctrine of sovereign immunity or the sacrosanct natural of national frontiers [ ... ] the very concept of universal jurisdiction is of recent vintage . [ ... ] it is unlikely that any of the signatories of either the u.n. conventions or the helsinki final act think it possible that national judges would use them as a basis for extradition requests regarding alleged crime committed outside their jurisdictions . the framers almost definitely believed that they were stating general principles not law that would be enforced by national courts .
