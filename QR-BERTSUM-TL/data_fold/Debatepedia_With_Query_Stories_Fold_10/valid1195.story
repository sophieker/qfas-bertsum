<s> cultural value ? is the flags clearly racist or does it have higher cultural value ? <eos>

<s> additionally it is not as if every southerner or even most southerners owns slaves . only the wealthy plantation owners did and it also was not as if anyone could have simply freed their slaves and made the problem go out as it was nearly difficult for free blacks to find employment . while slaves was a good evil it was not something which could be fixed with a snap of the finger and the fact that there were slaves in the south does not make the confederacy flag a racist symbol . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the confederate flags represented more than racism ( a complicated issue ) : <eos>
