<s> parenting : can homosexuals do a great jobs of parenting ? <eos>

<s> gay couples currently have the right to raise children and they are exercising that right . so first to claims that deny them marriage is somehow protect children is counter to the de facto reality . third those homosexual couples that choosing to raise children but who are denying marriage are denying the benefits to child-rearing that marriage offers . this is unfair to the children of homosexual couples as well as to gay couples . <eos>

@highlight

<s> gays raise child now but at a disadvantages w/o marriage <eos>
