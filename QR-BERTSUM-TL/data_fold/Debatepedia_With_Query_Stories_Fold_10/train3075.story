<s> personal wealth : will privatisation improve private wealth ? <eos>

<s> americans living at the poverty level must usually spend every cent of their disposable income just to survive . few in the lower-middle class have the funds available to put into a wealth-generating retirement account . thus they must rely on social security income to pay the bills when they reaching retirement age . unfortunately the current social security payout are at or below the poverty level . the money you earn in benefits based on what you pay in is less than what you 'd earn in a passbook savings account . <eos>

@highlight

<s> social secure taxes damage abilities of poor to survive . <eos>
