<s> arrested : is databasing dna of arrested alone insufficient ? <eos>

<s> dna databasing only of the arrested is justified . there is a high propensity of a former criminal to re-commit a crime . the dna profiles of the arrested are sufficient to solve crime cases . ordinary citizens who have not been convicted of a crime should be given the privilege to keep their personal data private . the problem of overrepresentation of ethnic minorities in the dna database is really not a problem since only the guilty are on the database . the innocent are spared no matter what their ethnicity is . <eos>

@highlight

<s> dna database should only be subjected to former criminals . <eos>
