<s> rights : is it wrong to think that animal have rights ? <eos>

<s> humans are creature of evolution . in evolution the natural order is to uphold the self-interests of the individuals and the species . therefore exploit other animals to advance humans self-interests is consistently with the natural order of evolution and thus ethical . it is only dishonest to damaging the interests of one 's own species . <eos>

@highlight

<s> humans have an evolutionary right to upholding self-interest by testing animals . <eos>
