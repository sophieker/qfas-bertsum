<s> error-rates : does wikipedia have a relatively high rate of error ? <eos>

<s> . among wikipedia 's nearly # million articles such examples are likely to exist just from the size of this number alone . on the other hand the few comparative studies which have been done so far have found the average factual accuracy of wikipedia to be similar or sometimes even higher than that of traditional encyclopedias . <eos>

@highlight

<s> criticism of the reliability of wikipedia tends to highlight isolated examples <eos>
