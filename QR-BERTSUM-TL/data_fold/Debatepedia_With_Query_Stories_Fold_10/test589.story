<s> non-experts : is it valuable or worse that non-experts can edit on wikipedia ? <eos>

<s> in a related problem large articles built via numerous ( individually reasonable ) edits to a small article can look okay `` close up '' but are sometimes horribly unstructured bloated excessively `` factoid '' uncohesive and self-indulgent when read through completely . in short add a sentence at a when does n't encourage quality on a larger scale ; at some stages the article must be restructured . this happens nowhere near sometimes enough . users who try to do this inevitably encounter animosity or resistance until they figure out that they should do it with a throwaway pseudonym not a real name . <eos>

@highlight

<s> micro-contributions can lead to nonsensical and uncoordinated articles . <eos>
