<s> economics : are random tests a waste of resources ? <eos>

<s> testing randomly has a serious disadvantage : we are testing many students who - clearly - do not do drugs . thus we are wasting our ( and their ) time money ( because the tests are not particularly cheap ) and what is even worse we are able to catch only a very small number of students who actually do not obey the law . <eos>

@highlight

<s> random tests are ineffective . <eos>
