<s> which another is good at reducing poverty ? <eos>

<s> the economy of india and china are growing rapidly because of capitalism . more people are being employed and the general quality of lives is increasing . this is because businesses are investing in those countries and it is the free market that circulates capital better than the government . immigrants have flocked to the u.s particularly during the industrial revolution because of capitalism . poor immigrants do not aspire to move to socialist countries . even the european countries that some consider to be socialist allow for capitalism . socialism can not help bring a nation out of poverty because it require everyone to be taxed but if the people are living in poverty then they have no money for the government to take . <eos>

@highlight

<s> all prosperous nations are capitalism nations <eos>
