<s> safety : are abortion safe ? what about legal versus illegal abortions ? <eos>

<s> if by 'safe ' you mean that a woman can survive then the answer is possibly . a woman can have even multiple abortions and live through each . but if by 'safe ' you mean that she will experiences no physical emotional or psychological harm then the answer is no . she will spend the rest of her life dealing with the myriad of consequences of the abortion by constantly shoving the rattling skeletons back into the closet . and will daily seek penance or seek to justify herself . in any case none of these leaves a woman 'safe ' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortion are emotionally and psychologically unsafe . <eos>
