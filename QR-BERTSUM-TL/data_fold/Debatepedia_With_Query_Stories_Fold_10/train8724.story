<s> morality : were aig 's bonus morally justified ? <eos>

<s> wayne outten . `` opinion : in defense of the aig bonuses '' . cnbc . march # # - `` as americans we must uphold the rule of law even when and particularly when it s difficult and challenges our mind of fairness . we are justifiably proud of our constitution which protects individuals against abuses of power by the government . our constitution prohibits congress and the state from passing 'bills of attainder ' ( laws that aiming to punish a single person or specific group of people ) and from enacting ex post facto laws ( laws that criminalize conduct retroactively ) ; the latter prohibition recognizes the fundamental unfairness of punish someone for doing something that was lawful when they did it .
