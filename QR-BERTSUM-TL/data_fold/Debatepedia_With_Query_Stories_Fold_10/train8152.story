<s> is prostitutes a criminalized crime ? <eos>

<s> assuming that problems of violence abused and sexually transmitted disease can be resolved with sufficient government regulation ( and it should be mentioned that these are not the reason why prostitution is illegal ) then who is the victim in prostitution ? the prostitute that enjoys here professions ( some do some do n't but room must be left in the law for those that enjoy it ) ? the customer that is wanting to pay for sex ? society at large ? whose liberties have been violated ? the problem is that it is very difficult or subjective to determine a specific victim which is an importance part of determining that a crime has been committed . <eos>
