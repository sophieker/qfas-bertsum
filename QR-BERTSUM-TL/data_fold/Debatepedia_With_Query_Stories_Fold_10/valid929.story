<s> charity : which fosters higher charity ? <eos>

<s> since third parties are externalised from prices in capitalism it is economically inefficient to consider the effects that something has on others . and since this exclusion of third parties leads to the overpricing of negative externalities and the underpricing of negative externalities it is cheaper to exploit somebody than it is to be fair towards them ( see the section on market prices for more detail ) . this is compounded by the self-centered pursuit of profit that capitalism encourages ( see the section on individual desires for more detail ) . these combine together to mean that it is economically inefficient in capitalism to consider others and so charity and solidarity is punished whereas anti-social behaviour is rewarded with profits . a perfect instance of <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism has a concomitant biased against helping others . <eos>
