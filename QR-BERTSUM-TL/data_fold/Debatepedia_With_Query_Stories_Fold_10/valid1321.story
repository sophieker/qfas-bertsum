<s> learning : does it lead to improving teaching in its broadest sense ? <eos>

<s> while music painting culture and physical educational are important they are not testable . you can only create a standardized test around information that is common and fairly objective . no child left out does this focusing on history math and reading comprehension . it can not be blamed for not testing arts and music . these studies are not testable . schools should however teach them and not merely focus on teaching to the nclb test . <eos>

@highlight

<s> k-12 tests what is testable ; art and music is not testable . <eos>
