<s> democracy : will a withdrawal be better for democracy in the world ? <eos>

<s> the domino theory depend on the premise that if the us withdraws iraq will turn into an islamist country which will then cause other countries to become becoming islamist . but it is a highly dubious notions that iraq would turn into an islamist country after a us withdrawal . this depend on iraq first turning into a failed state and its democracy government crumbling which is dubious and then islamism become the dominant political forces in the country such that it would influence other countries to adopt islamism which are also both highly dubious premises . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the domino theory relies on a highly questionable notions of afghanistan turn islamist . <eos>
