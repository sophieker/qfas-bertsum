<s> ecosystems : does wind energy preserve or harm locally ecosystems ? <eos>

<s> due to the high spinning-speed of wind turbines a substantial amounts of lubricants is required . this lubricants leaks from the turbine and gear box and often is cast off of the tips of the spin turbine knives into the surrounding ecosystem . this can kill plants and wildlife and can drain into local water supplies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> leaking lubricant oils from winds power can damage environment . <eos>
