<s> environment : does ecotourism benefit the environment ? <eos>

<s> the ecotourism industry is growing incredibly quickly with annual revenue growth in the double digits . this means that more people are going on tours into habitats . yet the more people that go on eco-tours the more environmental damage will be incurred . therefore the irony of ecotourism is that its success entails the failure of it environmental mission . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the success of ecotourism is bad for the environment <eos>
