<s> dominion : do humans have kingdom over animal ( and a way to hunt them ) ? <eos>

<s> the notion of man 's dominion over animals need not be thought of as a blank check for man to exploit animals . indeed it be be specific to connect the notion of `` dominion '' to stewardship '' over animals . but beings can be great stewards of animals while continuing to hunt them . it is merely necessary that beings maintain balance order and sustainability in the animal kingdom . but again this does not requiring the abandonment of hunt . <eos>

@highlight

<s> kingdom and hunting can and should be excercised responsibly . <eos>
