<s> rights : are amend/refine scanners consistently with individual rights ? <eos>

<s> anyone who refuses to be scanned will receive an equivalent screening in a complete pat-down . so the passenger has the choice and is not coerced into receiving what may be viewed by the individual as an intrusive `` virtual strip search '' . the canada air transport secure authority for example implemented such a program in may of # at kelowna airport in b.c . where passengers were body-scanned on a voluntary basis apparently without major complaint . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> scanning procedure is never optional to all passengers . <eos>
