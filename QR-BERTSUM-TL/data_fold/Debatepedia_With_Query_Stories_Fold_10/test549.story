<s> cultural standards : does assimilation set a bogus moral-cultural standard ? <eos>

<s> assimilation is often falsely characterized as the melting of cultural uniqueness into a single cultural identity . in fact assimilation need not have anything to do with culture ; that would be acculturation . a conservative approach to assimilation would see only a lacking of legal and governmental distinctions between groups and could uphold a single national language for example . it would attempting to foster a common sets of economic requirements and skills that would enable all citizens to take advantage of all the opportunities available to them . but it need not forces cultural change upon anyone . while acculturation often does accompany assimilation it is important not to confuse the two . <eos>

<s> assimilation does not mean abandon cultural distinctions <eos>
