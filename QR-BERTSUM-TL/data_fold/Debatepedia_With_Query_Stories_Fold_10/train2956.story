<s> choice : do mandatory calorie counts improve consumer choice ? <eos>

<s> bill phillips . `` the truth about counting calories '' . formerfatguy.com : `` there are n't many people who can keep track of their calorie intake for an extended period of time . as an alternative i recommend counting 'portions . ' a portion of food is roughly equal to the size of your clenched fist or the palm of your hand . each portion of protein or carbohydrate typically contains between 100 and 150 calories . for example one chicken breast is approximately one portion of protein and one medium-sized baked potato is approximately one portion of carbohydrate .
