<s> space exploration : is colonizing the moon critical to space exploration/discovery ? <eos>

<s> `` why go back to the moon ? '' nasa . january # # : `` to put the arguments for a return to the moon and a lunar outpost in the most general terms : the moon is essentially a whole planet one that has so far been barely touched . but this new planet is only a few days travel away and we have already camped on it . to turn our backs on the moon would be equivalent to european exploration stopping after columbus s few landings or china s destruction of its giant ships to concentrate on domestic problems in the # th century . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> moon colonization similarly important as colonizing america <eos>
