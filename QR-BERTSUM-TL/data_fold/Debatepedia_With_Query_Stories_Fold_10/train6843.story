<s> is payment of incomes tax necessary by us law ? <eos>

<s> needs the word `` income '' is not define but once in the irs tax code and if we refer to the definitions of `` income '' as define by the constitution we find that it is actually define as `` profit '' or `` gains `` not compensation for labor which as no-fly pointing out is actually more of a barter than a profit . <eos>

@highlight

<s> income is not defined clearly in us tax code or constitution . <eos>
