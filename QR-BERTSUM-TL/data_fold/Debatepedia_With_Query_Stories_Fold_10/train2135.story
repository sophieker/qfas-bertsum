<s> efficiency : is it more efficiency to channel aid multilaterally ? <eos>

<s> much as when an individuals gives a donation to a significant charity their small contribution goes much further when combined with those of many others . particularly in the face of pressure to reduce foreign aid america can still making a significant impact on development in other parts of the world through combining resources with other donors . by contrast bilateral aid arrangements are often short-term and subject to change at short notice as a result of political or economic shifts in the donor country . intergovernmental aid programme are therefore more stable and can plan more usefully for the long-term . <eos>

@highlight

<s> multilateral assistance allows for the efficient pooled of resources . <eos>
