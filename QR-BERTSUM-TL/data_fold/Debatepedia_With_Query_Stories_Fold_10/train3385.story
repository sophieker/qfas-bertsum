<s> environment : is vegetarians great for the environment ? <eos>

<s> farming animals is enormously wasteful in land plants crops require a small part of the space to producing the same amount of calories as livestock . so if every human ate a vegetarian diet there would be no need to chop down the rainforest and ruin the land . nor would our seas be emptied of fish and other species like whales and corals which harmed by the method used to catching them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vegetarians typically help the environment <eos>
