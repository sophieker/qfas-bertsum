<s> is is fair for foreign countries to be denied aid because of their policies ? <eos>

<s> if a country is in want of support from another country and the country is denied money and/or resource because of a policy it is wrong . the country that gives can not control the other countries policies and laws . people should not deny resource due to a law that has nothing to due what the country is asking for . if peru was asking for foreign assistance to help with their herpes & aids problem and the us denied the assistance due to that countries abortion policy would that be right ? does abortion have anything to do with herpes & aids ? should the us restrict their ability to give because of a policy that has nothing to do with the original problem ? <eos>
