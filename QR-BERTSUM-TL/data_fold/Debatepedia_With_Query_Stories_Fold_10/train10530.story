<s> barbaric procedure : is partial-birth abortion a barbaric procedure ? <eos>

<s> on this basis it may be appropriate to conclude that a fetus fetus and a convicted death-row criminal should be treated with a similar level of decency . given that most liberal democracies prohibit violent form of capital punishment it may then take that liberal democracies ( and others ) should prohibit the commonly methods of partial birth abortions on the grounds that they are excessively violent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a bans on partial birth abortions would stop other but more `` gruesome '' forms of late terms abortions . <eos>
