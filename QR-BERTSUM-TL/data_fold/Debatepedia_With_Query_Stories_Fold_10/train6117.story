<s> alliance will : does the alliance of us allies in iraq supporting withdrawal ? <eos>

<s> there is dangers in government running foreign policy which lack a basis of popular support . this is especially true in britain with its substantial muslim minority but nearly all the coalition countries are divide on the issue . with iraq dominating politics and the media trusting in government is lost and it is hard for those in power to press their domestic agendas ( e.g . pensions savings reform ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public opinions in alliance countries is moving opposed in favour of withdrawing forces from iraq as soon as possible . <eos>
