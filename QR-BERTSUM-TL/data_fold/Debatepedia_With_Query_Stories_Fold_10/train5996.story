<s> effectivity : would the ban be effective ? <eos>

<s> `` the case for a ban on children labor in the export goods sectors alone ( ... ) is weaker since this could result in children being diverted to less desirable or more hazards work . in general it is better to take economy-wide measures against children labor and if there is to be a sector-specific ban this should be basis on the working conditions of that sectors rather than the destination of the goods . '' [ `` child labor : cause consequence and cures with remark on international labor standards '' by american economic association # ] <eos>
