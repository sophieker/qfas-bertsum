<s> war : is 18 a good drinking age since 18-year-olds go to war ? <eos>

<s> robert voas . `` there 's no benefit to lowering the drinking age '' . christian science monitor . january 12 2006 - `` first i 'm not sure what going to war and being allowed to drink have in common . the military takes in youngsters particularly because they are not yet fully developed and can be molded into soldiers . the 21 law is predicated on the fact that drinking is more dangerous for youth because they 're still developing mentally and physically and they lack experience and are more likely to take risks . ask platoon leaders and unit commanders and they 'll tell you that the last thing they want is young soldiers drinking . '' <eos>
