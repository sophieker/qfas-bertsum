<s> destination economies : do destination economies benefit from influxes of immigrants ? <eos>

<s> however since the 19th century economic realities in the world have changed a lot . a huge pool of unskilled labour is no longer crucial to economic success and the domestic markets in developed countries are carefully divided among thousands of domestic and foreign producers . furthermore the immigrants that come to the us and western european countries now are mostly uneducated people who can not contribute new technologies or special knowledge and who do not try to integrate into their host culture .

<s> the success of immigrants in boosting the american economy was only possible thanks to a huge internal free liberal market <eos>
