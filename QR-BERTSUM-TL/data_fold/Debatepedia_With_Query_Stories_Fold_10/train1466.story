<s> education : do children benefit from watching tv ? <eos>

<s> television has become a temple of mass production shallow values and stereotypes that have a great influence on modern society . this negative effect spreads with the growing popularity of tv especially among young people and children . it defiantly changes our society for the worse trivialising culture and making us all conform to a bland `` hollywood '' model of entertainment in which regional traditions and diversity are lost . <eos>

@highlight

<s> television is mostly directed to films and shows that have commercial purposes but little cultural value : <eos>
