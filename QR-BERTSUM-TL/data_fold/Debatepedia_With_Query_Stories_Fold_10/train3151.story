<s> is the conscript financially favourable ? <eos>

<s> conscription means purchasing and maintaining lots of `` unnecessary '' equipment for people who -- most probably -- will ever fight in any conflict and if they indeed did they would n't be as useful as professional soldiers and professional armies due to the lack of training ( one or two year of civilian service are not enough ) . it is financially wiser to have a larger well-equipped professional troops than millions of soldiers lacking weapons transporters and experience to saying the least . <eos>

@highlight

<s> conscription creates numbers but not quality . <eos>
