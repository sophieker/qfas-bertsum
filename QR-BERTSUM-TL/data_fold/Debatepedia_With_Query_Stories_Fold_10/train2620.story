<s> because a robots mission to mars is so much expensive than a manned mission many more unmanned mission can be sent . the mars rover mission cost about $ # million a pop . an optimistic estimate puts the cost of sending humans to mars at $ # billion . others think it would cost as much as a trillion dollars . that is # mars rover missions . this meaning that a manned mission will probably obtain almost # / # th of the scientific data and perhaps # / # th of the scientific knowledge and progress . a manned mission therefore is decidedly unscientific in this regard .
