<s> social : are there broad social reasons for providing illegals with driver 's licenses ? <eos>

<s> - this debate often assumes that driver 's licenses would simply be offered to illegal mexican immigrants with the claim that the us economy is dependent on these `` productive '' illegal immigrants . but what about other groups of illegal immigrants that may be `` less desirable '' ? what about an illegal immigrant from for example iran ? the problem is that the proposition tends to base its arguments off of only one particular group of illegal immigrants ( mexican immigrants constituted around # % of the illegal immigrant population in # [ # ] ) while seemingly denying the costs of accepting other groups of illegal immigrants into this program . <eos>

@highlight

<s> driver 's licenses would have to be offered to all illegal immigrants ( not just mexican ) <eos>
