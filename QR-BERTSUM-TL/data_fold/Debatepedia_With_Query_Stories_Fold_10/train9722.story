<s> rights : are israeli settlements consistent with israeli and palestinian rights ? <eos>

<s> stephanie kuory . `` israeli settlements illegal and getting worse '' . the middle east research and information project . september # # : `` settlements are constructed under israeli military or private security protection . israel 's ministry of defense provides weapons to settlers which are then used by militants to harass palestinians into vacating their land . reports on settler violence by b'tselem the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied territories document that settlers fear little or no retribution from israeli law enforcement because of a history of superficial investigations -- only # percent of palestinian complaints are probed -- and light sentencing or pardons for the few settlers ever convicted . the same reports note that israeli military and police often do not intervene <eos>
