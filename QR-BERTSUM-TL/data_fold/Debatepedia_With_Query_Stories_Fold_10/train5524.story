<s> undemocratic ? is the electoral university undemocratic ? <eos>

<s> - the united states is not a pure popular democracy . the us constitution limits power between various entities including the people the government government and state governments . the electoral college must be understood in the historical constitutional context . while the united states is a democracy a popular vote would only satisfy the interests of the government government and the people ; pastures would be left out . the electoral college sufficiently incorporates the interests of states while adequately meeting the interests of the people and the government government . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the us electoral university is an appropriate federal-state-people power-sharing deal <eos>
