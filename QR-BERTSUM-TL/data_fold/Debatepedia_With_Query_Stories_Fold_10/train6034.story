<s> creationism as science : does creationism qualify as science ? <eos>

<s> some creationists have argued that 'creationism ' is a theory consistent with the science method . the hypothesis it adopts is that god created abuser heaven and earth ... ' some thousands of years ago and that man did not `` evolve '' into his current state . supporters of creationism then cited supporting evidence for this theory . <eos>

@highlight

<s> creationist is empirically testable . <eos>
