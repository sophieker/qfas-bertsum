<s> vs. automatic enrollment : is mandatory healthcare insurance good than automatic enrollment ? <eos>

<s> mandated send the signal that healthcare insurance is necessary in society both for personal well-being and for the well-being of other taxpayers and member of society . an automated enrollment program which allows persons to opt out does not send as strong a signal on these points . <eos>

@highlight

<s> mandates send weaker signal than automatic but voluntary enrollment . <eos>
