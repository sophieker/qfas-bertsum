<s> experience : does mccain have more experience than obama ? <eos>

<s> while experience can be seen as a virtue it can also be viewed as a liability in the sense that experience within the washington beltway which clinton has can have a corrupting influence . obama conversely is a fresh face on the american political scene . as such he embodies the fundamental change that washington dc so desperately needs . he has not been stuck in the washington dc `` beltway '' which has kept him clear of much of the corruption and influence that can occur as a result of this . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama would be a fresh uncorrupted face in the white house <eos>
