<s> value of debate : does allowing debate legitimise holocaust denial ? <eos>

<s> proper historians seek to consider findings to reach conclusions rather than working in reverse . holocaust sceptics refuse to be persuade by debate . debate therefore does not stop holocaust sceptics spouting their dangerous myths : it is necessary to use crimes penalties to stop them from doing so . <eos>

@highlight

<s> holocaust sceptics are not persuaded by reason ; penalty necessary . <eos>
