<s> rights : do # year-old citizens have a right to run for office ? <eos>

<s> in a democracy the right to hold offices is given by voters . if voters deciding to electing an # year old their vote of confidence is a sufficient demonstration of his or her qualifications and right to govern . and even if an # year old elected official gives mistakes due to his or her inexperience complaint are not appropriate given the fact that a democratic vote was cast in favor of the candidate . additionally we should trust the electorate to be capable of making judgments about candidates . if there is reason to believe that an # year old candidate is too young and inexperienced then we should trust that the electorate will recognizing this fact and vote for another candidate . <eos>

<s> the way to holding office is given by voters not mandate . <eos>
