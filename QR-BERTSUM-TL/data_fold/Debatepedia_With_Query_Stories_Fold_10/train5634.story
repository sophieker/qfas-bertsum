<s> rebelliousness : do drink age making drink rebellious and cool ? <eos>

<s> the british and us limits on drinking alcohol do not stop teens from consuming alcohol instead it makes underage drinking cool and so makes teens more likely to do it . in europe spain and france the limit is lower and a cultures of having champagne at the table from a young age encourages a responsibility approach where alcohol is not consumed for its own sake or to excess . <eos>
