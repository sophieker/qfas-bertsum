<s> hiv/aids : is church policy on contraceptives appropriate in context of hiv/aids ? <eos>

<s> there are clear harms that result from even a small proportion of the world s # . # billion baptised catholics ( # m and # m of whom live in africa and latin america respectively ) failing to use condoms to protect against aids . in # there were # m hiv/aids sufferers worldwide # . # m of whom lived in sub-saharan africa with the total figure predicted to double by # . the catholic church is thus partly responsible for at least some of the # . # m deaths every year from hiv/aids . whilst the trend in european nations is towards lapsed catholicism in africa strict obedience to the church s teachings remains strong and so it is reasonable to assume that the church could prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths <eos>
