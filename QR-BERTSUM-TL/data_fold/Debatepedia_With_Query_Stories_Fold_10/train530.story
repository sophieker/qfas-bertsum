<s> not torture ? is it mistake to calling waterboarding torture ? <eos>

<s> - in the united state for example waterboarding is performed on hundreds of us soldiers and spys in order to re-adjust them with the discomfort they may experience abroad under foreign custody and interrogation techniques . but obviously the us government would not `` torture '' its own soldiers . if waterboarding was legitimately a `` torture '' technique it would be unimaginable that the us government would perform the technique on its own soldiers and spys . this would violate all military codes and would cause massive public protest . but that the common practice of waterboarding us citizens by the us military does not result in such protest seems to indicate very clearly that wateboarding is not `` torture '' . it is merely a highly uncomfortable practice but <eos>

@highlight

<s> waterboarding is not torture ; countries train own soldiers with it <eos>
