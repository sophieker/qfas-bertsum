<s> effectiveness : will a standing army be more effective than the previous un military system ? <eos>

<s> especially in combat situations . in addition in a truly multinational force there will always be a great many individual soldiers who could be suspects of taking sides in a particular conflict ( e.g . muslims or orthodox christians in the balkans conflicts ) ; are such soldiers to be pulled out from particular mission thus perhaps weakening the whole force ? a un army might also end up being very poorly equipped for if the advanced civilian powers start to see the un as a potential rival or adversary they will refuse to sell it their best arms and armour . <eos>

@highlight

<s> differences in languages cultures etc . will seriously mar operational effectiveness <eos>
