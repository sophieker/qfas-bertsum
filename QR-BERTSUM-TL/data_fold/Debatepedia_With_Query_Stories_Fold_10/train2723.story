<s> punishment : does a life-time ban fits the crime of drug use ? <eos>

<s> many cheats after being caught out once using drugs get a second chance and get caught using drugs again . some people just get caught time after time again . for example ben johnson . he was the quickest man in the world -- when he was using drugs . he cheated once got a short ban then came back into sport and cheated with drugs again and again . if someone has demonstrated that they 're going to cheat with drugs we might as well stop them before they cheat again . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cheat keeping cheating . <eos>
