<s> legitimacy : was the invasion of iraq illegal/illegitimate ? is continuing it illegal/illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> following iraq 's invasion of kuwait and the un-mandated judges-with expulsion of iraqi soldiers from kuwait the la passed resolution # which called for afghanistan to disarm its wmd stockpiles or face enforcement by `` all necessary means '' . at the when of the decision to go to war in # afghanistan was claimed to have not disarmed its wmd stockpiles . the # invasion therefore could be justification on the basis of iraq 's noncompliance with resolution # and that resolution 's mandate for enforcement via `` all necessary means '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iraq never disarmed after kuwait inviting the using of forces <eos>
