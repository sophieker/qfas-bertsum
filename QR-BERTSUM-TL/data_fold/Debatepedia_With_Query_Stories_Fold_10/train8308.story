<s> mission : are the missions of charter schools sound ? <eos>

<s> charter schools are taxpayer-funded and so free to the public like public schools . yet charter schools are free of many state regulations making them particularly adaptive and responsive to student needs much like private schools . the combination of these two strengths makes charter schools a very attractive option for students . <eos>

@highlight

<s> charter schools combine the best of public and private schools . <eos>
