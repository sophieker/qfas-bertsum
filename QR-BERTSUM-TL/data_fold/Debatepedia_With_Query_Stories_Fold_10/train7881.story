<s> saving offenders : would castration help `` save '' offender from themselves ? <eos>

<s> court testimony has shown that many sexual criminals would dearly like to be free of their overwhelming sexual urges . for this reason they often request castration in order to save themselves from themselves . in the same sense forcing castration of repeat sex offenders can save these individuals from themselves . there are plenty of examples of these kind of individuals but one particularly noteworthy one is james jenkins a sexual offender held in a virginia prison who castrated himself with a razor in order to relieve himself from his urges . he said in # to the washington post : `` castration has doing precisely what i wanted it to do . i have not had any sexual urges or desires in over two years . <eos>
