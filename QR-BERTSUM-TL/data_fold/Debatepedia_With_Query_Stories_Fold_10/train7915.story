<s> economics : is photovoltaic energy economically sound ? <eos>

<s> it is misleading to say that sun energy is free . the price of energy resources have always been determined by cost of extracting the energy and transforming it into a consumable form . indeed oils is `` free '' to those that discover it but it is sold at a price related to the expense of extracting and refining the good . photovoltaic energy is the same . the price of sun energy is found in the expense of the technology and other factors involvement in extracting it and transforming it into a consumable form . it is not `` free '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> while sunlight is download the technologies for capturing it is expensive . <eos>
