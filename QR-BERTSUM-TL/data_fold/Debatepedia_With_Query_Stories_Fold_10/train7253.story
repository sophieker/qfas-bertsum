<s> vs. imf : is an emf necessary beyond roles of international monetary fund ? <eos>

<s> roberto perotti argued in the economist magazine roundtable on this topic : `` ( b ) y the authors calculations this facility would yesterday give athens accessing to something like . # percent of its gdp ... plus any additional discretionary fund from the pool of all accumulated savings . however . # percent of gdp would make no difference to athens today ; and ... the intervention needed would eat up the whole fund just for a small country like greece . the key problem country spain with a public debt just above the maastricht level this year would have made virtually no contribution to the emf . in the end effective intervention especially when the risk of contagion is high is likely to depend on the discretion of germany <eos>

<s> calling imf is not humiliating but sensible during crisis . <eos>
