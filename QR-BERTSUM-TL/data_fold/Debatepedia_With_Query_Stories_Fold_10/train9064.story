<s> economics : is government ownership of water utilities economically efficient ? <eos>

<s> - for profit companies are managed by individuals with a direct for-profit stake in the efficiency and productivity of their company . if they manage their company poorly they lose money . if they manage their company well they profit . it is this direct profit-interest at the managerial level that ensures for-profit companies in general perform efficiently . conversely there is not profit interest at the managerial level in government-owned companies . if the government-owned company performs highly efficiently or somewhat efficiently it matters less to managers of these companies because it does not typically affect them monetarily . therefore for-profit companies have a greater incentive structure for the efficient operations of its company and the empirical evidence generally demonstrates this to hold true . <eos>
