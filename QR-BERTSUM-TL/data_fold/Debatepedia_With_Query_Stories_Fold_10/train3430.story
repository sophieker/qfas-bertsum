<s> special case : are anti-smoking campaigns a good idea ? <eos>

<s> as m. lindstrom in his book buyology explains these `` negative '' advertisements do not prevent or discourage people from smoking quite upon the contrary - a large neuromarketing study has concluded that anti-smoking adverts stimulate an area in brain associated with craving . that means that he very warnings intended to reduce smoking might well be an effective marketing tool for tobacco companies ! <eos>

<s> anti-smoking adverts have opposite effect than intended . <eos>
