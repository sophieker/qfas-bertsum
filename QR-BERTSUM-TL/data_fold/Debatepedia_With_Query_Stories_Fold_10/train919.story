<s> freedom of speech : is criminalization of holocaust denial consistent with free speech ? <eos>

<s> while holocaust denial may be dangerous if it gained public support the government 's responsibility should be in fighting this with logic and reasoning opposed to a ban . rather it means that the state has a responsibility to ensure that the public are exposed to the arguments that show that holocaust deniers are wrong . this is best done through compulsory history teaching about the holocaust in schools . <eos>

<s> danger of public accepting holocaust denial should be fought by logic . <eos>
