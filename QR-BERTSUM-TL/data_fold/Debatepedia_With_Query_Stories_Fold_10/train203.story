<s> representation : is an elected president a superior form of representation ? <eos>

<s> people dislike the future direction of the european union . issues such as cap asylum etc . etc . can all be solved without the imposition of a directly elected president who would take power away from the nation states thus taking the european union even further from people s consciousness . an alternative proposal would be for the council of ministers to end the rotating six-month presidency and for its member states to appoint a politician to run the council s meetings and represent europe more effectively . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> an eu president would not represent individual eu states well . <eos>
