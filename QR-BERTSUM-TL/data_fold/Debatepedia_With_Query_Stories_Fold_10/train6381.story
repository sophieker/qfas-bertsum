<s> global warming : can biofuels help combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> biofuels are less polluting than fossil fuels because co # is absorb in the process of photosynthesis by the very plant that are being used to producing biofuel . another way to think of this is that in the cycle of this process plant are grown which absorb c # from the surroundings to photosynthesize and grow . when these plant are converted into biofuel and then burned the c # that is released into the surroundings is equivalent to the c # that was absorb by the plant in the process of photosynthesis . this means that the amounts of c # released is equivalent to the amounts absorb and that biofuels are therefore carbon neutral . <eos>

@highlight

<s> carbon neutral biofuel only emits co # they draw from atmosphere <eos>
