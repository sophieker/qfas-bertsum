<s> designer babies : can sexuality choices avoid a slippery slopes to designer babies ? <eos>

<s> individuals do not procreate randomly : they choose their partners and often choose the time of conception according to their own age and prosperity . parents give so much to children . they invest year of their life and a large amount of their earnings in their upbringing . isn t it fair that in return they get to deciding something like this if they need to ? this is an extension of reproductive rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` designer baby '' fear are exaggerated ; all babies are to some extent designed . <eos>
