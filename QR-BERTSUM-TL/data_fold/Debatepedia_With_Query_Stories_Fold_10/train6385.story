<s> iran : would withdrawal benefit the united states ' ability to deal with iran ? <eos>

<s> historically iraq has been iran 's primary adversary with the iran-iraq war ( # - # ) being the primary bloody expression of that adversarial relationship . by invading iraq the america states elimination one of iran 's key adversaries in the region . this gives it odd that supporters of the war are now arguing that the america states should not withdraw from iraq because this would benefits iran . it 's odd that supporters of the war however ignored how the invasion would benefits iran and now emphasize how withdrawing would benefits iran . you ca n't have your cakes and eat it too . <eos>

<s> the iraq wars has benefiting iran by eliminating its iraqi adversaries <eos>
