<s> marriage defined : can definition of marriage include gay marriage ? <eos>

<s> . president barack obama has said on multiple occassions during his political career including the # presidential election campaign : `` i believe marriage is between a man and a woman . '' [ # ] indeed marriage throughout its thousands of years of existence has only been used to describe the union of a man and woman toward the general end of starting a family and raising children . to change the definition to include gays would go against thousands of years of history from which definitions are formed and should be maintained . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marriage is defined as between a man and woman <eos>
