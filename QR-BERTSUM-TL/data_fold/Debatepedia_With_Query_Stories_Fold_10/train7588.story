<s> experience : does obama have more experience than obama ? <eos>

<s> while experience can be seeing as a virtue it can also be view as a liable in the sense that experience throughout the washington beltway which clinton has can have a corrupts influence . obama conversely is a fresh face on the america political scene . as such he embodies the fundamental change that washington dc so desperately needs . he has not been stuck in the washington dc `` beltway '' which has kept him clearly of much of the corrupt and influence that can occur as a result of this . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama would be a fresh unaltered face in the white houses <eos>
