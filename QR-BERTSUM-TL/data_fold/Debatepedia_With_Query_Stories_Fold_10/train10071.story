<s> `` is thorium an energy alchemist 's dream ? '' scitizen . mar 27th 2009 : `` with all these advantages what is holding back development of thorium-based fuels ? first most commercial reactors run on uranium . thorium fuels have been used in some commercial reactors with success . but no fuel-producing infrastructure yet exists for supplying thorium commercially and so it remains for more economical and reliable to use uranium . ( one small company has been trying to change that with limited success . ) '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> switching nuclear infrastructure from uranium to thorium is hard . <eos>
