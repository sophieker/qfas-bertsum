<s> rights : is it mistake to believe that animals have rights ? <eos>

<s> humans are creatures of evolution . in evolution the natural order is to upholding the self-interest of the individual and the species . therefore exploiting other animals to advance human self-interest is consistent with the natural order of evolution and therefore ethical . it is only unethical to damage the interests of one 's own species . <eos>

@highlight

<s> humans have an evolutionary right to upholding self-interest by testing animals . <eos>
