<s> culture : is bullfighting a cultural creative practice ? <eos>

<s> video pictures books and news report all make it possible for individuals to teach about and understand death . it 's occurring around us naturally all the time . it is completely unnecessary therefore to artificially produce death in the bullfights arena in ordering to create an appreciation of the cycles of life and death etc nature watching is also a good alternative . or even hunting or fishing in which an individual generally attempts to quickly and decently kills an animal that they will then eat . torturing and bull for entertainment is unnecessary when compared to these outlets for understanding life and death . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people need not see bull dies in order to know death . <eos>
