<s> blockade : is gaza blockade legal ? was raid just on these grounds ? <eos>

<s> armstrong bender . `` was israeli s flotilla raid illegally or legally ? '' tufts roundtable . june # nd # : `` if you support gaza . then you believe that israeli is 'occupying ' gaza and israeli is in violation of international law because it is denying gaza s sovereign right to trade and aid . '' [ from this you can then arguing that israeli had no right to board the flotilla in international ocean and thus that the raid was illegally under international law . ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> blockade of gaza is illegal ca n't justifying flotilla raids <eos>
