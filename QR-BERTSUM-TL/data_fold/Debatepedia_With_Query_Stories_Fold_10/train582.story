'' . belief net . june # # : `` there 's the issue that election campaigning is n't always the best use of a judge 's time . we expect our judges to handle a lot of cases in a given year and the need in a winner-takes-all race to make speeches traveling to meet with constituent groups give access to the media for interviews etc . means a portion possibly a small one of the judge 's time and attention during an election year are going to be demanded by the campaign itself .
