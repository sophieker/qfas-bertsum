<s> fair to wealthy ? : is the estate tax unfair to the wealthy ? <eos>

<s> american council for capital formation 2000 : `` many countries tax estates ( or inheritances ) more lightly than does the united states according to a recent survey of 24 industrialized and developing countries compiled by arthur andersen llp for the accf center for policy research ( see figure 1 ) . in fact the u.s. marginal estate tax rate is higher than that of all other countries surveyed except japan . this conclusion lends support to the views of many academic scholars and policy experts that the estate tax should be repealed or reduced because it adds to the already-heavy u.s. tax burden on saving and investment and by raising the cost of capital impedes investment . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> us estate tax is large compared to other countries . <eos>
