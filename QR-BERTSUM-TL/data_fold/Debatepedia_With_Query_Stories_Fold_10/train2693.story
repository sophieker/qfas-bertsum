<s> judgment : are young individuals can to judge whether to join ? <eos>

<s> in fact the media normally focuses on the bad news coming out of afghanistan and iraq ignoring the good work of our military there . a career in the military also offers young people a lot of benefits and it is only right that they should get to hear about those as well . and no one is signed up on the spot in the classroom ; they always get the chance to know about it over a few months or more and to discuss the decision carefully with parents . <eos>

@highlight

<s> young those are n't stupid understand risk of joining military . <eos>
