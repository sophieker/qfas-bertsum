<s> free speech : is bearing the confederacy flag protected by free speech right ? <eos>

<s> first amendment rights are being trampled in the name of political correctness . this is one of the reasons why the american civil liberties union oppose any plans to ban the practice . it is especially unreasonable when other flags - those of afghanistan or palestine for example highly contentious symbols themselves - are not topic to such bans . furthermore slaves were brought to the usa on ships sailing under the stars and stripes - there is no suggestion that that should be banned ; rather in many states the national flag is present by statutory requirement in every public building .
