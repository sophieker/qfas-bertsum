<s> clone : is cloning fair to cloning humans ? <eos>

<s> john f. kilner and robert p. george . `` human cloning : what s at stake '' . the center for bioethics and dignity . # - `` all human cloning all creation of newest human humans by asexual processes should be legally prohibited . but even with necessary laws in place it is likely that someday someone would break the laws creating and bringing to term a cloning human or perhaps several such persons . it is important that we acknowledge in advance their human dignity and fundamental rights . <eos>

@highlight

<s> while illegal clone should have rights a ban is but justification <eos>
