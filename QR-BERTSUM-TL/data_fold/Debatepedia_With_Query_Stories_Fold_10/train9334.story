<s> war on terror : did the war in iraq help the war on terror ? <eos>

<s> war in iraq might have become on a very small level a front in the war on terror but this was as much a result of the act of waging such an unjust war and `` occupation '' as anything else - many locals were incited to fight the occupation and were subsequently labelled `` terrorists . '' fighting the terrorism that resulted from the war is clearly not a justification for waging the war in the first place ; it nets no benefits . <eos>

@highlight

<s> solving problems created by war does not justify war . <eos>
