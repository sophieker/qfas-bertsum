<s> society : is an incest ban bad public policy ? <eos>

<s> it is foolish to suggest that incest does not occur already . if we acknowledging this reality we can ensure that those currently involvement in it can obtain those things everyone else can getting counselling for their relationship for example . as it is currently illegal those are unwilling to seek such aid . if the proposition is to be believed these individuals particularly need such help . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legal bestiality affords existing couples better treatment/aid . <eos>
