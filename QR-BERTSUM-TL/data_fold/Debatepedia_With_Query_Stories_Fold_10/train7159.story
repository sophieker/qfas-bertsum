<s> hiv/aids : is church policy on contraceptives appropriate in context of hiv/aids ? <eos>

<s> . humanae vitae pope paul vi - neither is it valid to argue as a justification for sexual intercourse which is deliberately contraceptive that a lesser evil is to be preferred to a greater one or that such intercourse would merge with procreative acts of past and future to form a single entity and so be qualified by exactly the same moral goodness as these . though it is true that sometimes it is lawful to tolerate a lesser moral evil in order to avoid a greater evil or in order to promote a greater good `` it is never lawful even for the gravest reasons to do evil that good may come of it ( # ) in other words to intend <eos>

@highlight

<s> evil ( condoms ) should not be used to fight evil ( hiv/aids ) <eos>
