<s> secret deal : did britain secretly disagree to give the malvinas to argentina ? <eos>

<s> . since the implementation of resolutions # the british governments has always maintained it would only transfer sovereignty if the population requested it . spain recognised britains rights to the islands in # allowing the british to physically leave the islands . this agreement can only be cancelled mutually . physical abandonment does not mean politcal abandonment . argentina claims the islands are theirs despite the fact nobody with bsas authority order to do so set one foot on the islands until # ( # years after independence and # after taking control of bsas ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> the term 'prepared ' 'will ' and 'draft'are not binding just speculation <eos>
