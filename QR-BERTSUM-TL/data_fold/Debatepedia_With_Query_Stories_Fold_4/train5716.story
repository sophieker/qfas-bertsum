<s> felix salmon . `` why the greece bail-out won t work . '' reuters . be # # : `` the fact is that the bail-out package really doesn t address the problem which is one of solvency rather than liquidity . the european loans are being extended at about # % which while much lower than market rates is still not low much to make anything approaching a dent in greece s debt dynamics . and by the time the bail-out package is exhausted if greece even gets that far its debt-to-gdp ratio will be significantly higher than it is way now thanks to both a rise denominator and a declining denominator .
