<s> reasonable suspicion : will reasonable suspicion of illegality be applied fairly ? <eos>

<s> shikha dalmia . `` arizona 's law : anti-immigrant and anti-constitutional . '' forbes . april 5th 2010 : `` the amended law limits such inquiries to instances when cops make a lawful stop detention or arrest in the course of enforcing some other law or local ordinance . but including local ordinances as grounds for an immigration inquiry opens all kinds of tantalizing harassment possibilities for officials like joe arpaio -- the notorious but popular arizona sheriff who has made it his personal mission to root out undocumented aliens from the state by launching crime sweeps in latino communities on the flimsiest of pretexts . [ ... ] under the new law arpaio could troll hispanic neighborhoods demanding the papers of anyone breaking say a local pooper-scooper law while walking their dogs . '' <eos>
