<s> competition : can cooperatives scales to compete with private insurers ? <eos>

<s> sen. kent conrad ( d-n.d. ) : `` the intent is for the co-ops to become self-sustaining entities support owned and govern by their own members . '' the fact that they are self-sustaining in this ways makes them in the long-run a very scalable model as they can generating an independent stream of revenues . this compares favorable against a government-run public insurance option which is dependent on taxpayer funding and the whims of governments budget allocations . in this sense co-ops offer a good competitive alternatives to private health insurance companies . <eos>
