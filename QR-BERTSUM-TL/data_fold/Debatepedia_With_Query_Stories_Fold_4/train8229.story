<s> unacceptable ? - is a nuclear iran unacceptable/intolerable/too great a risk ? <eos>

<s> even if iran opts not to use a nuclear weapon there are major additional risks . it 's possession of a nuclear weapon would make it much more likely to act aggressively in the international system through conventional means or through its sponsorship of terrorism . nuclear weapons will support such aggression because it will make other states think twice about responding aggressively out of fear that iran will then respond with nuclear strikes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a nuclear-armed iran will be more aggressive . <eos>
