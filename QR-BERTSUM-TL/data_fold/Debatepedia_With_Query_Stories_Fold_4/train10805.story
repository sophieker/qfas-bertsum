<s> feasibility : is the colonizing of the lunar feasible ? <eos>

<s> because the moon 's axis of rotation is nearly perfectly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane it be be possible to powers polar colony exclusively with solar energy . for example malapert mountain located near the shackleton volcano at the lunar south pole is attractive as a possible site for a lunar base ( not only ) because it receives almost continuous sunlight . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a colony at the moon north pole could relying on solar energy . <eos>
