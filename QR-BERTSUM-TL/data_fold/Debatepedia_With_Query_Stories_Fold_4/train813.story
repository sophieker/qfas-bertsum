<s> in korea : are landmines unnecessary between north and south korea ? <eos>

<s> `` the mine ban treaty and the us government : 10 years and waiting '' . us campaign to ban landmines . 3 dec. 2007 : `` there is no evidence that the u.s. has used antipersonnel landmines with the exception of the north/south korean border area since 1991 . '' and it seems to be the sole exception requested by the us as a condition of it agreeing to joining the land mine ban treaty . <eos>

@highlight

<s> korea is the sole exception requested by us to mine ban . <eos>
