<s> environment : do advances in scientific harm the environment or do they rather help to protecting it ? <eos>

<s> had n't it been for science we would be freely exacerbating naturally resources emitting co # emission or killing endangered animals . thank to science we are well aware of the risks and thus we are able to eliminate such detrimental actions and - at the same time - implementing necessary legislation in order to protect the environments ( such as kyoto protocol ) . had n't it been for science we would be ignorant of how much are we harming the nature . <eos>

@highlight

<s> science is the perfect watch-dog . <eos>
