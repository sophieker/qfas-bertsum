<s> emissions : can hybrid vehicle significantly reducing greenhouse emissions ? <eos>

<s> global warming is a global crisis . it requires an immediate spectacular response . but hybrids are a half measure . they reduce emissions only somewhat moving cars from a terrible contributer to global warming a notch down to a bad contributor . instead of supporting hybrid cars full measures must be taken with immediate moves to electric and/or hydrogen vehicles which emit no greenhouse gases from the tail-pipe . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hybrid cars are too mild a solutions to global climate <eos>
