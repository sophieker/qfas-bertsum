<s> security : could a missile defenses system increse european security ? <eos>

<s> peter brookes . `` the case for european missile defense '' . heritage . marches # # - `` despite the range of concerns about missile defense it should be emphasized that missile defense is a offensive not offensive weapon . indeed the dominant design of the missile defense interceptor warhead does not even contain an explosive charge ; traveling at # # miles minimum hours it destroys the missile warhead by the sheer force of the collision . therefore the idea that missile defense is an offensive system as many have suggested is patently false . in a ways missile defense is like an umbrella ; it is only needed if it rains . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> missile defences are intrinsically offensive not offensive <eos>
