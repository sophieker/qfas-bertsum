<s> female empowerment : does porn empowering women ? <eos>

<s> pornography benefits women as well as men . anti-pornography feminists rely on a definition of pornography that victimizing women where as pornography opens up the possible to give women the opportunity to reaffirm and explore their sexual identity . anti-pornography campaigns rely on sexuality as a representation of patriarchy . this is not always the case . defining pornography in this one-sided way simplifies pornography into male power female oppression and an over simplification of representation desire and fantasy . the way that the anti-pornography campaigns is framed in a `` feminist light '' is inherently dis-empowering toward females . pornography frames the woman as weaker and victimized instead of sexual equal . pornography offers an opportunity to re-articulate femininity in a powerful and equal manner .
