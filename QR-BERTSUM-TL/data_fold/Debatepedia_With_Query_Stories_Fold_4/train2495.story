<s> due punishment : does the penalty fit the crime ? <eos>

<s> for such a horrifying crime a suitable punishments is needed . castration fit the bill perfectly . it has been shown that for many sex offenders the crime is caused by both emotional and physical urges no rational counselling will prevent a repetition of the crime . thus castration does not only stop further crimes by the offenders ( one of the main purposes of any punishment ) but it is a strong deterrent for prospective offenders . <eos>

@highlight

<s> sexual assaults is one of worst kinds ; castration appropriate . <eos>
