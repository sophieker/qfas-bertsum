<s> presuming that some or most abortions should be discouraged is 1 weeks a great cut-off ? <eos>

<s> while one might better give the benefit of the doubt to importance question of `` when does life begin '' to conception by # weeks we have sufficient development in the fetus/baby to have a very developed and recognizable human baby forms with movement and we have heart beat and brain waves . these two amplitude and brain activity are measurements for whether one is `` alive '' even as an adult . so while abortions might remain legal prior to # months after # weeks abortions should definitely be strongly discouraged or unlawful ( with some major legitimate exceptions perhaps ) . there should be no exceptions for states or ambiguity about `` medical necessity . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> any cutoff certainly should n't be any later than # months : <eos>
