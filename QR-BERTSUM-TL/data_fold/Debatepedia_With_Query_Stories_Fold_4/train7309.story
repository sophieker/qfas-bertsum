<s> fairness : is performance-enhancing drug-use unfair in sports ? <eos>

<s> the criteria that athletes should only be applying their 'natural abilities ' also runs into trouble . the highly advanced training technologies health programs sports drinks use of such things as caffeine pills and other energy boosters seem to defeat the notion that athletes are currently applying only their 'natural abilities ' . performance enhancing drugs would not go too far beyond the current circumstances for athletes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> performance-enhancing drugs are consistent with trends away from `` natural ability '' . <eos>
