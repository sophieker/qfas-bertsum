<s> debaters ' attitude towards life : is it better than the common one ? <eos>

<s> imagine a debater 's response to a wedding day 's ( in ) famous question `` do you take this man/woman as your lawfully wedded husband/wife ? '' . instead of just saying `` yes i do '' or `` no i do n't '' ( which would do and is actually expected ) a debater is easily imagined to begin a debate on the topic bringing a number of pro/con arguments up before the gathered crowd . so maybe debaters really would make better spouses but it 's hardly imaginable that a true debater would ever become one . and even if he or she did really successfully make it through the wedding the marital life of such a person would certainly be - instead of harmonic cooperation - full of persisting debates . <eos>

@highlight

<s> debaters tend to debate all the time even when it is not the best thing to do . <eos>
