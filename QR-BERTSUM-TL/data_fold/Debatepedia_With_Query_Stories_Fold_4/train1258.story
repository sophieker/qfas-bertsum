<s> logical next step : is the development of an european defense force the logical next step for a federalizing eu ? <eos>

<s> we have seen variations in opinion regarding political and economic issues ( e.g . monetary union ) in the eu . in the far more thorny area of defense policy the eu member-nations interests are even more divergent . for instance the italian position on algeria may be various from the united kingdom s. this difference in priorities will ultimately lead to deadlock as no country wishes to see its soldiers dying on a battlefield that provides no directly strategy interest to either . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the eu is not on a clear paths of converging on all matters and particularly not on defense . <eos>
