<s> security : are pre- # borders best ways to security ? <eos>

<s> ehud olmert : `` we can never totally return to the indefensible pre- # borders ... we simply can not afford to make israel [ # miles ] widest again at its center . we ca n't allow the palestinians to be a couple [ miles ] from [ tel aviv 's ] ben gurion airport in the age of shoulder-fire missile with the capacity to shoot down sized jets . but that does n't think we should remain in every corners of the west bank or in gaza where fewer than # # jews lives next to # . # million palestinians have been protected by twice as many soldiers . '' [ # ] <eos>
