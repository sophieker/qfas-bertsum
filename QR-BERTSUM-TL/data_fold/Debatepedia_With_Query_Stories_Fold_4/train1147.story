<s> feasibility : is it possible to abolishing the veto power ? <eos>

<s> as richard butler has observed a proper debate about the defects of the vetoed might at the least yield a more constructive interpretation of the nature of the vetoed and its application . an informed public awareness of the potential for the security council to be bypassed or hijacking might lead to pressure for exercises of the power in accordance with the charter aims . particularly china was persuade or compelled not to cast the vetoed in respect of the council measures on kosovo . this reasonable approach prevailed in despite of vocal chinese opposition to the bombing campaign and the destroyed of the chinese embassy by nato forces . <eos>

<s> reforming the la security council is statutorily feasible . <eos>
