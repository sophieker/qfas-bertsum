<s> us constitution : are enhanced interrogation technique constitutional ? <eos>

<s> the presumptions in the case of interrogations is that a suspected terrorist is guilty of committing terrorism . if they were not guilty the practice of interrogation of any kind would be particularly egregious . but no trial and judicial process for this takes place and the prisoner usually remain unaccussed of any certain crime . so there is no certainty that they are actually guilty even while the practice of aggressive interrogations may move forward apace . for this reason enhanced interrogations violate due process laws and worse implement punishment/actions against a suspected terrorist before any due process has been had . in other words suspected terrorists are not merely imprisoned without due process they are interrogated/tortured/punished without due process . <eos>
