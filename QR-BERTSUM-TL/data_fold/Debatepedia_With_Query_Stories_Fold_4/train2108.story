<s> vs. harm reduction : is a `` war '' a better idea than harm reduction ? <eos>

<s> ethan a. nadelmann . national review online . : `` # . most people can use most drugs without doing much harm to themselves or anyone else as mr. buckley reminds us citing professor duke . only a tiny percentage of the # million americans who have tried marijuana have gone on to have problems with that or any other drug . the same is true of the tens of millions of americans who have used cocaine or hallucinogens . most of those who did have a problem at one time or another do n't any more . that a few million americans have serious problems with illicit drugs today is an issue meriting responsible national attention but it is no reason to demonize those drugs and the people <eos>

@highlight

<s> most try drugs only a handful of times ; little harm <eos>
