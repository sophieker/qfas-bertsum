<s> violence : is violence ever justified in civil disobedience ? <eos>

<s> too often civil disobedience involves productive violence directed against innocent members of the public or against the police often causing serious injuries . the broadwater farm riots and the miner s strike are both instances where groups have injured or killed policemen . animal rights activists and anti-abortion campaigners have also been noted for their violence in the past . no cause is worth the sacrifice of innocent lives ; protest must be peaceful or not at all .
