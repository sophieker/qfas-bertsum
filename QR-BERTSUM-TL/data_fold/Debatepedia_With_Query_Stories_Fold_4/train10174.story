<s> lying : is lying to child justified ? <eos>

<s> firstly the ideas of magic and better things give a kid something to believe in . if you going to a child 's house during christmas time who believes santa is real you will see the brightness on his face and you can tell he has `` adopted the christmas spirit '' . a children who knows santa 's mythical existence is more absorbed by the ideal of receive than the spirit in which we give at christmas . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lying to child can be justified . <eos>
