<s> internationalized : would an aviation tax be internationalized ? <eos>

<s> attempts to place a tax on fuel by individuals states will fail as airlines can easily obtain fuel more inexpensively elsewhere . and if individuals countries raise the cost of flying to and from their airports they will lose income from tourists and business travellers to other states . trying to putting a global tax in place will also fail - international treaties probably make it illegally to tax aviation fuel ( the # chicago convention reinforced by many unilateral air service agreements ) and there is no international consensus for change .

<s> an international tax on aviation gasoline would be impractical and difficult to put into action . <eos>
