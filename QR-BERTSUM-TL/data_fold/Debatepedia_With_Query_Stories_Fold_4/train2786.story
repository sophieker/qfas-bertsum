<s> terms humaneness : is veal agriculture generally humane or cruel ? <eos>

<s> after babies cows are taken away from their mothers and sold at auctions they are taken to a tiny wood crate that they will living in for the rest of their short lives . they can not exercise or even lie down and they are kept in darkness and deprived of particular nutrients in order to ensure that their muscles remain weak and tender when consumed by humans . treating babies cows in this way is not justified by any human desire for tender meat . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> veal agriculture is inherently abusive to calf to meet market demands <eos>
