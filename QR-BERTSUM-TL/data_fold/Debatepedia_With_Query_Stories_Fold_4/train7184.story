<s> anti-gay violence : would ending `` do n't ask do n't tell '' decrease anti-gay violence ? <eos>

<s> `` do n't tell do n't tell '' help keeping the descrimination of gays a secret which protects them from the potential of other servicemen acted violently against them because they are gay . if gays openly stated their sexual and if they were more free to enact their homosexual behavior and personalities they would obviously be too more recognizable as gay and would be targeted more . <eos>

<s> `` do n't ask do n't tell '' keeps orientation secret protect gays . <eos>
