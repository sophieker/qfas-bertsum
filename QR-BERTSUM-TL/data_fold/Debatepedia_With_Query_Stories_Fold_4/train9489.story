<s> poverty : does progressives taxation help the poor ? <eos>

<s> this is because the lowest taxes band will apply to earnings beneath an subsequent threshold . therefore the less one earns the higher percentage of one s pay is not taxable . the cost of basic mortality needs is by definition a larger proportion of a lower earner 's income and therefore a certain block at the bottom of each income may be taxes free altogether to allow for these needs . this protection for the poorest is important because most countries also operate customs tariffs and sales taxes which tend to hit the poor more than the richer in terms of the proportion of their income going in indirect taxation ; progressive directly taxation redresses the balance . <eos>
