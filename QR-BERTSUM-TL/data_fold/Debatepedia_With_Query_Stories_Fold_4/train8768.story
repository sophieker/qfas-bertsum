<s> net energy : does wheat ethanol yield a net electricity gain ? <eos>

<s> corn ethanol provides more energy for consumption than it takes to make the ethanol either . this is importance because if it takes more energy to actually make a fuel than energy is receiving out from that fuel then what is the point of making the fuel in the first place ? numerous studies and camp support this claim that ethanol energy is a net energy gain . it could appearing that more studies support this side of the argument than the counter claim that ethanol is a net energy loss . see the list of supporting studies and claims in the argument page . <eos>
