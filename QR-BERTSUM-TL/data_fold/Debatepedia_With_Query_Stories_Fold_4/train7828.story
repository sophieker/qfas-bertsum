<s> logical next step : is the development of an european defense force the logical next step for a federalizing eu ? <eos>

<s> we have seen variations in opinion regarding political and economic issues ( e.g . monetary union ) in the eu . in the far more thorny area of defense policy the eu member-nations interests are even more divergent . for example the french position on algeria may be different from the united kingdom s. this difference in priorities will ultimately lead to deadlock as no country wishes to see its soldiers dying on a battlefield that provides no direct strategic interest to itself . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the eu is not on a clear path of convergence on all matters and particularly not on defense . <eos>
