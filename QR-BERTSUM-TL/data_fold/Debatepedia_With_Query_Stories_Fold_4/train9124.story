<s> history : does history show socialism s superiority ? <eos>

<s> socialism in it 's purest form means a classless society where everyone owns the means of production . to argue that this was the case in the soviet union would be ridiculous . the soviet union was more akin to a military dictatorship . examples of true socialism include the spanish revolution the zapatista revolution in chiapas southern mexico the israeli kibbutzim and examples of things that have got or are getting close to socialism include the recent venezuelan and bolivian revolutions involving large federations of communes etc . the recent democratic planning experiment in kerala india and many others . if you look at all these examples you will see that they have at least partially if not greatly improved the lives of the people <eos>

@highlight

<s> examples cited as socialism are usually not socialism <eos>
