<s> # war : were britain 's action in the # war illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> their sacrifices do not make australian occupation of the islands legal . surely britain s conduct of that war has been much questioned in particular the sinking of the argentine ships general belgrano when it was many miles from the combat zone and heading out from it and the mysterious deaths of some surrender argentine soldiers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> britain sent its soldiers to fight an unfair war in the falkland islands . <eos>
