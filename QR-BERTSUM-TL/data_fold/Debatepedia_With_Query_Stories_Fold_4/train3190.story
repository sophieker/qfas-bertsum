<s> distinct identity : does tibet have a distinct national identity ? <eos>

<s> china has many different groups with many different historical cultural geographic and linguistic characteristics . tibet is only one of those groups . why should this warrant that it become independent ? in modern multicultural societies differences should be rejoiced rather than exploited to divide a country . <eos>

@highlight

<s> in a multicultural society tibet 's uniqueness does not warrant independence <eos>
