<s> vietnam comparison : is iraq one vietnam ? would this mean leave or stay ? <eos>

<s> opponents of withdrawing from vietnam in the late # s and early # s almost all argued that it would damage us credibility in the international arena . and but this is not what happened after the withdrawal . instead the united state continued to rising in powers and influence around the world with an economy and military that was no longer encumbered by the vietnam war . it geopolitical strength increased and thus so too did its geopolitical credibility and leverage increase . these lesson should be applied to iraq . <eos>

@highlight

<s> withdrawing from vietnam did not undercut us credibility and it wo n't in iraq or <eos>
