<s> consequences : what are the consequence of no stimulus ? <eos>

<s> david keene . `` from hope to doomsday '' . the hill . february 9 2009 - `` there is no denying the seriousness of the current recession but the specter of a still-popular president on television night after night to predict that things are going to get much much worse is not something one would call confidence-inspiring . one can lead by inspiring or by trying to scare the heck out of people . in our country at least successful presidents have used the inspirational approach the approach that mr. obama took during his campaign but which he seems to have abandoned . '' <eos>

<s> fear-mongering on consequences of no us stimulus is wrong <eos>
