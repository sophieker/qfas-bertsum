<s> vs. nuclear : how does solar energy compare to nuclear energy ? <eos>

<s> sun light is diffuse . this means that solar panels must take up a large swath of territory in order to absorb all the energy . consuming so much land is problematic environmentally agriculturally and economically . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear energy does not require as much land as solar . <eos>
