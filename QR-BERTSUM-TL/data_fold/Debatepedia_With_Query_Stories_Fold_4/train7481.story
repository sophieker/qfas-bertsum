<s> competition : do charters schools foster beneficial competition ? <eos>

<s> scott elliott . `` the case against charter school in dayton '' . dayton daily . november # # - `` schools are not mutual funds . if you pick a mutual fund all you care about is performance . if it begins to lose money you dump it . school are much more complicated . once you pick one for your child it s awfully hard to switch . you arrange your life around the school s schedule your child makes friends . it s more than a business relationship . it s an emotional investment . and those ties are awfully tough to sever even if the school s performance is disappointing . '' <eos>

<s> school are not like businesses ; ca n't just let bad ones die <eos>
