<s> guilt as criteria : should guilt be the primary criteria for trials not whether a defendant has been tried before ? <eos>

<s> the problem with the double jeopardy rule is that people who are clearly guilty - because new evidence has emerged because they ve confessed - are not being punished for crimes they have committed . we believe that guilty people should be punished for their crime and our justice system should be tailored to allow that . we have as great a duties to ensure miscarriages of justice are not atrocities on victims as on accused . an offence committed ten years months does not cease to be an offence because time has passed or because the perpetrator has managed to evade justice in the past . the criteria by which the decision to charges an individual is taken ought to be likelihood of <eos>

<s> guilt should be the primary criteria for trial not double jeopardy considerations : <eos>
