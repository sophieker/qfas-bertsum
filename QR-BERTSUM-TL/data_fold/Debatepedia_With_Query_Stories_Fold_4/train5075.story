<s> is the loan strategy of the ibrd financially sound ? <eos>

<s> member countries purchase shares in ibrd but pay to the bank only # % of the cost of shares . the remainder is callable as a promise to pay if necessary . these contingent liabilities for donors allow the ibrd to raise the vast majority of money required for its operations from international capital markets of europe japan and the united states . the reduced cost of the shares and the capacity of the bank to raise commercial finance rather than rely solely on contributions of donor countries guarantees that the capital contribution expected of the donor countries remain reasonable . furthermore the irresponsible fiscal policies of developing countries is not rewarded by the bank . from the mid- # s compliance with codes of best practice is <eos>

@highlight

<s> the strategy for financing the loans of the ibrd is remarkably efficient . <eos>
