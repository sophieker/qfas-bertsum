<s> government : is a fat tax justification in shaping social ends ? <eos>

<s> arguments about `` cost to society '' are premised on the virtue of `` society '' being forced to paying for individuals `` bad '' choices . shared risks should be voluntary and not coerced by the state because only the individuals can assign value to the risks or reward of their choices . `` cost to society '' arguments are moot in the absence of coerced social welfare . <eos>

@highlight

<s> fatty tax social engineering distances persons from consequences . <eos>
