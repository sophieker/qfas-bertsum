<s> vs tribunals : are court better than tribunals for trying terrorists ? <eos>

<s> john c. eastman . `` military tribunals are perfectly constitutional . '' ashbrook center . november # : `` the fifth amendment require indictment by a grand jury but specifically excepted from that requirement are `` cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger . '' in other words the men and women serving in our own military forces are not entitled to the benefits of trial in civilian courts nor are civilians serving in the militia when they have been called into service . it would be odd indeed to read the fifth amendment as affording higher access to civilian courts to non-uniformed soldiers of terrorism waging war on the united states than it <eos>

@highlight

<s> tribunal for terrorists is consistently with us constitution <eos>
