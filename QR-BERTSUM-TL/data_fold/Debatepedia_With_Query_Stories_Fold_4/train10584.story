<s> naturally expansion : is the `` natural expansion '' of settlements justified ? <eos>

<s> `` land grab : israel 's settlements policy in the west bank '' . the israeli information center for human rights . may # : `` the israeli governments have implemented a consistent and systematic policy intended to encourage jewish citizens to migrate to the west bank . one of the tools used to this end is to grant financial benefits and incentives to citizens - both directly and through the jewish local authorities . the purpose of this supporting is to raise the standard of living of these citizens and to encourage migration to the west bank . '' it is difficult therefore for israelis to say that the `` natural expansion '' of settlements is justified and should remain into the future . there is nothing `` natural '' about the growth of israeli <eos>

@highlight

<s> israeli encourages settlements ; they are not grow `` naturally '' . <eos>
