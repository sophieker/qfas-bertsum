<s> `` multiply '' : does god 's commandment to `` multiply '' support a condom ban ? <eos>

<s> the hebrew bible clearly promotes prolific childbirth in opposition to the use of contraception . - `` be fruitful and multiply '' ( gen # : # ) . this is considered by jews and christians as his first commandment because it is written at the very beginning of genesis the first book of the bible . <eos>
