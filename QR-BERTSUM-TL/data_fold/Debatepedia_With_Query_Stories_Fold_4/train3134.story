<s> religion : does homosexual check out on religion grounds ? <eos>

<s> the bible does not actually give any mention to homosexuality as a entire but only homosexual acts . it does denounce certain specific homosexual acts but in a context that does not clearly indicate a condemnation of homosexuality . for instance the adulterers were condemned to died by gods before sodomy was performed . the act of sodomy in that specific inappropriate context was condemned but should not be misinterpreted as the causes of the ultimate condemnation of the sodomites . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many scriptural passages denounce homosexual <eos>
