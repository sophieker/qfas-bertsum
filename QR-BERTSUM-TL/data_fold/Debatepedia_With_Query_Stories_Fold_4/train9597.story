<s> global economy : does free trade benefit the global economy ? <eos>

<s> there are two ways to maximize profit either to increase sales or to cut costs . the easier one to do is cut costs because increased sales is ultimately dictated by the laws of supply and demand . the biggest cost to most multinationals and large corporations is salary pay or wages so to cut that cost jobs are sent overseas to developing countries where real wages are much lower and the price of doing business is adequately cheaper . in turn that deteriorates the number of existing jobs domestically . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the main goal of free trade is to maximize profits not welfare . <eos>
