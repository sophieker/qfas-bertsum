<s> in the world : which candidate would be best for the world ? <eos>

<s> obama 's african decent may be a useful way to win the hearts and minds of individuals in the middle east . this is highly important to the united states in its current struggles in the middle east and in the war on terror . that a man of muslim-kenyan origins is running for president makes a strong statement to the middle east about a number of things . first it viscerally demonstrates that the united states is not a `` white christian nation on a crusade against the islamic world '' . second it demonstrates that in america and a democracy opportunity for any individual of any creed abounds . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama 's african decent will win valuable points in the muslim world . <eos>
