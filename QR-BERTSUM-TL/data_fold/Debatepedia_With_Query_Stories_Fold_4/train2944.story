<s> developing countries : does outsourcing benefit developing countries ? <eos>

<s> offshoring involves a focus on cost at the expense of all else . it favors regimes where cheap consistent labour is available even where this is because of poverty or government authoritarianism ( e.g . the banning of trade unions ) . therefore the sorts of social systems seen in developed countries are seen as costly and lose out in comparison to low-skilled economies which also support far less social infrastructure . this is doubly damaging as it leads to a spiral effect in developed economies whereby a diminishing number of workers thus must support an increasing number of social claims which accelerate the economy s competitive decline . <eos>
