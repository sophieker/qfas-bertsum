<s> rights : is access to waters a right ? <eos>

<s> - some argue that even if water is considered a right firms can accurately ( possibly even more accurately than governments ) provide it to those in need . this has not proven to be the case . firms inherently have an interest in profits over the interests of individuals . this does not mean that firms are evil but simply that they are profit-seeking entities that do not have a fundamental interest in ensuring a citizen 's right and access to water . firms have an interest in charging as much as consumers are wanting to pay for water . it is common that private firms increase rates dramatically ( sometimes as much as two to three times over ) in their profit interests . many ca n't afford the fees <eos>

@highlight

<s> profit firms are inherently incapable of securing the right to water <eos>
