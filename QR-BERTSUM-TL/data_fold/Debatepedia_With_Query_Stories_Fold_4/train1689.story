<s> legitimacy : was the invasion of iraq illegal/illegitimate ? is continuing it illegal/illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> following iraq 's invasion of kuwait and the un-mandated us-led expulsion of iraqi troops from kuwait the un passed resolution # which called for iraq to disarm its wmd stockpiles or face enforcement by `` all necessary means '' . at the time of the decision to go to war in # iraq was believed to have not disarmed its wmd stockpiles . the # invasion therefore could be justified on the basis of iraq 's non-compliance with resolution # and that resolution 's mandate for enforcement via `` all necessary means '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iraq never disarmed after kuwait inviting the use of force <eos>
