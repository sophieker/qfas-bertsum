<s> party power : do open primaries increase/decrease party power ? <eos>

<s> in many open primaries candidates have the option to affiliate with a party but they are not required to have `` d '' or `` r '' next to their name on the ballot . this generally frees politicians from the current excessive dependence on party affiliation and the political machines that run elections and often strong-arm candidates on the positions they will take . <eos>

<s> open primaries free candidates from party affiliations . <eos>
