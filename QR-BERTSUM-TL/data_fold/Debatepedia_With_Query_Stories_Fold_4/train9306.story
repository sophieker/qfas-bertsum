<s> moderate forms of torture - is it acceptable to allow more moderate forms of torture ? <eos>

<s> the infliction of severe pain or bodily damage is generally considered the definition of torture . but this leaves plenty of legal room for advanced interrogations that inflict serious discomfort and pain ( not severe pain ) on the suspect . the law actually allows for a substantial amount of aggressive interrogation techniques . <eos>

@highlight

<s> advanced interrogations are perfectly legal : <eos>
