<s> civil war ? would an late withdrawal avoid caused a civil war ? <eos>

<s> the counter-insurgency war in iraq is fought largely against sunni insurgents and al al-qaeda terrorists . the us have disproportionately armed shiite and kurdish militias in order to fighting this sunni-counter-insurgency . this of course has fuelled extremist conflict and it undermines the role of coalition forces in iraq as indifferent intermediaries in the conflict . <eos>

@highlight

<s> coalition forces are fueling sectarian conflict by play groups against each other <eos>
