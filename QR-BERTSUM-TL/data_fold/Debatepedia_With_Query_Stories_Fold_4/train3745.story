<s> costs and economics : are the costs of zero tolerant laws tolerable ? does it stimulate economic growth in any way ? <eos>

<s> either we have to throw limitless money at doubling the number of officers ( it is almost impossible to recruit and train so those even if we would afford it ) . or we have to divert officers away from investigations and serious crime prevention in order to put them back on the pavement . this reduces detection of important crimes in return for catching graffiti artists . even when reported crime rates drop this does not proving that zero tolerance achieves anything because it is corporate crime large scale drug dealing that is ignored and these are rarely reported . a patrolling officer might pass a burglary every # years and probably would n't notice it .

@highlight

<s> the expense of zero tolerance in money and manpower and jails actually makes policing worse : <eos>
