<s> god 's existence : does god exist ? <eos>

<s> religious belief is completely irrational . there is no evidence that god exists . reported miracles healings etc . are never reliably proved actually to have happened and in any case everyone s religious experiences are different and point to the psychological differences between human beings not to any objective divine reality . belief in god is simply wish-fulfilment . it would be nice if there was a loving all powerful being watching over us but there isn t . <eos>
