<s> punishment : is it wrong to punish prisoners by depriving vote ? <eos>

<s> they are shut away not only to protect society but also to symbolise society s disgust at their acts . although prisoners are no longer executed in many jurisdictions the idea of civic death is that they lose the rights of citizens without dying in a literal sense . those who offend against the common good of society should have no right to contribute to the governance of society . they can only be readmitted to society both physically and in terms of their rights when they have made amends to society by serving their sentence . <eos>

@highlight

<s> prisoners are rightly punished by denying their vote <eos>
