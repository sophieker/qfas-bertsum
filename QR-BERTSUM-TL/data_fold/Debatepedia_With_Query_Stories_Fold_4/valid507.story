<s> pain : do animals experience very little or no pain ? <eos>

<s> [ # ] `` nearly all the external signs that lead us to infer pain in other humans can be seen in other species especially the species most closely related to us -- the species of mammals and birds . the behavioral signs include writhing facial contortions moaning yelping or other forms of calling attempts to avoid the source of the pain appearance of fear at the prospect of its repetition and so on . in addition we know that these animals have nervous systems very like ours which respond physiologically like ours do when the animal is in circumstances in which we would feel pain . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> animals feel and suffer in very similar ways as humans <eos>
