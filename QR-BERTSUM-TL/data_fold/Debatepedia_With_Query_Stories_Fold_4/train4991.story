<s> viability : is viable a great cut-off points for abortion ? <eos>

<s> it is faulty to claim that a fetus can achieving `` viability '' where it becomes an independant creature and worthy of some rights . humans are always increasing in their independence and ability to survive . in modernity children can not survive on their own into their teens . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a line on `` viability '' is arbitrary ; from conception humans are always increasingly `` viable '' <eos>
