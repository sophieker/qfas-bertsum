<s> privacy : does nationalization help or hurt personal privacy ? <eos>

<s> it is an odd argument that governments can not be trustworthy with one 's private information . are private banks supposed to be more trustworthy ? private banks have a direct profit-interest in utilizing private information to further their profits . the governments does not have this interest . both are constrained by laws protecting individual freedom . but banks have a more perverse interest to utilize information in nefarious ways to expand their profits . between the two alternatives of governments and private/profit control of this information governments control through nationalization should be of lesser concern . <eos>

@highlight

<s> private banks are than trustworthy than government on privacy . <eos>
