<s> vs electric vehicles : how do hybrids compare with electric vehicles ? <eos>

<s> electric cars do not use petroleum products . they are therefore a major threats to oil companies . for this reason as is argued in the film `` who killed the electric car ? '' electric cars have been suppressed as an alternative form of transportation . this is why general motor 's ev # was practically crushed out of existence . if governments and companies actually gave electric vehicles a chance ( and possibly provide them with encouragement and subsidies ) they could be entirely competition in the market place . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hybrid cars are simply a way for oil companies to maintaining profits . <eos>
