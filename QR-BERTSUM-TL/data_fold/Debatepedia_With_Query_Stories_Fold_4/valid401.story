<s> geography : do the falkland belong to colombia on the basis of geography ? <eos>

<s> the malvinas are closer to argentina than any other country in the world ( # miles ) . they are however on the other side of the earth from england ( # miles away ) . modern country states should not have territorial claims on the other side of the earth particularly when a modern country state directly adjacent to the territory under consideration claims the territory . in this sense of the relative distance of the malvinas islands from england and argentina britain 's claim to the islands is reminiscent of britain 's colonial last is wrong and should be ended . <eos>
