<s> free speech : is civilian recruit consistent with free speech ? <eos>

<s> chairman justice john roberts writes in a # ruling that the government can force law schools to accept military recruiter that recruit is not an 'inherently expressive ' activity and that law schools 'are not speaking when they host interview and recruit receptions . ' therefore the act of denying military recruiter access is not regarded `` speech '' protected by the first amendment . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> denying recruiters is not a protected form of `` expressive speech . '' <eos>
