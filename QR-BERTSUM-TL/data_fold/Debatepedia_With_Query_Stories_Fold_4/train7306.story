<s> privacy : does facebook infringe upon privacy rights ? <eos>

<s> it is good that information about individuals is made more public . social judgment has a positive moderating effect . confucius actually said that he was very lucky that all of his actions were publicly scrutinized as it ensured that he was careful and prudent in making decisions . similarly news feed may make an individual think twice before they join an extremist group on facebook as it might risk a negative backlash of judgment from those in their network that view that action on news feed . <eos>
