<s> economics : are there economic benefit to year round schooling ? <eos>

<s> the summer-time is an important opportunity for students to earn some cash and gain some experience in the work-force . year-round school programs make this impossible . this can alienate students that need to generate funding to help paying for their education or that desire to obtain experience that helps them reflect on the sort of future they want for themselves and the sort of higher education required to achieve these goals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> year-round education damages summer-break student employment . <eos>
