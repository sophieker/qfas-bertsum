<s> backlash : can banning head scarves avoid muslim-community backlash ? <eos>

<s> christina duval . `` banning the hijab . against the ban for secular education '' . workers power . feb 2004 - `` the quoted 48 per cent of muslims in france who are in favour of the ban - even if we take opinion polls as accurate reflections of real feelings - has to be put in the context of this offensive where standing up to this ban leads to muslims being branded anti-republic anti-french and part of the `` islamic threat '' . in other words there 's no reason to believe that muslims supporting the ban are less reactionary than those wanting to visibly show their solidarity with the victims of imperialism 's wars . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> many muslims hide opposition to veil ban to avoid attacks from non-muslims <eos>
