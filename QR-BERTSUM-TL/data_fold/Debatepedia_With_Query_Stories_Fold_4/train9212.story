<s> stability - could self-determination help international stability ? <eos>

<s> the 1964 organisation of african unity ( oau ) stated in the cairo resolution that it would accept the boundaries drawn by colonial powers . governments ought to concentrate on bolstering states with civic identities . federalism is one government structure that can accommodate self-determination within national boundaries . for example in canada quebec has relative autonomy including some native courts . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the re-drawing of state boundaries is hardly the best way to promote stability in newly independent states : <eos>
