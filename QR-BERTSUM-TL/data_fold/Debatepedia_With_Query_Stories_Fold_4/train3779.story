<s> market prices : do market prices make sense ? <eos>

<s> in capitalism the market determines price including pay - the price of labour . if some people are paid huge sums that is because other people believe they have unique talents which are worth paying for . if they fail to perform then they will stop being rewarded so highly . this is all part of a dynamic capitalist system which values individuality and rewards ability and risk-taking . <eos>

@highlight

<s> market prices are always fair prices . <eos>
