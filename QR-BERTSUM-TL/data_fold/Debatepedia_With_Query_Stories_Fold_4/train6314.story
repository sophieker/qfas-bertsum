<s> poor : could legal euthanasia avoid jeopardizing the vulnerable poor ? <eos>

<s> opponents of euthanasia often argue that the poor are vulnerable in the event of the legalizing of euthanasia because they ca n't afford health care and so will seek euthanasia instead . this is predicated on the false notion that died can somehow be a good alternative to the inability to do something else . unless a poor person does n't want to living anymore they will not seek euthanasia as an alternative to unaffordable health care . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor those that ca n't afford health care wo n't then seek abortion <eos>
