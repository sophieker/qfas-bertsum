<s> traditional methods : are traditional interrogations methods insufficient ? <eos>

<s> a bill on interrogation techniques was passing on february # # in the us senator in a # to # vote limiting the number of techniques allowed to only `` those interrogation techniques explicitly authorized by the # army field manual . '' this aimed to eliminate enhanced interrogation techniques based on the argument that the army field manual is sufficient to obtain information from prisoners ensure national security and uphold us norms of justice . based on the same premises president obama signed a january # th # executive ordering halting `` enhanced interrogations '' and reverting back to the army field carlos guidelines . <eos>
