( charlottesville : philosophy documentation center press # . - `` the problem with policy arguments that hinge on health and bio-pollution is that it takes the issue out of the hands of the public and puts it in the hands of scientists . when the debate over policy is relegated to experts citizens are not able to participate in a decision-making process over an issue that effects the general welfare . unless there is some kind of democratic accountability such policy decisions are unjust and illegitimate . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> relying on scientists who favor gm foods undermines democratic processes . <eos>
