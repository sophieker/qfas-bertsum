<s> enforcement : is is impossible to enforce anti-surrogacy laws ? <eos>

<s> it would merely lead to the physical impregnated of the surrogate by the aspiring father rather than a clean surgical procedure that avoided the emotions problems caused by an exact sexual act between the surrogate and the aspiring father . <eos>

@highlight

<s> on a basic note no laws against surrogacy could be enforce properly . <eos>
