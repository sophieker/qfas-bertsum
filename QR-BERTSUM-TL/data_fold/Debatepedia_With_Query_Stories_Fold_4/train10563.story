<s> abuse : is medical marijuana likely to resulting in abuse and further drug-use ? <eos>

<s> peter provet phd president and chief executive officer at the odyssey house letter to the editors of the new york times . apr . # # : `` as a treatment provider i support the food and drug administration 's dismissal of medical benefit from marijuana . regardless of the heated political debate that swirls around this issue the fact remains that despite the institute of medicine 's claim to the contrary for people vulnerable to addicting disease marijuana is a gateway drug that lead to the use of more danger drugs like cocaine and heroin . not everyone who cigarettes marijuana will necessarily become an addict . but why open the gate to increased use for the sake of unproven medical benefits when we already know the harm <eos>

<s> medical cannabis can act as a gateways drug to harder ones <eos>
