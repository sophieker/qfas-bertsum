<s> global warming : is solar power keys to reducing emissions and fighting global warming ? <eos>

<s> the fundamental quantity here is the energy payback time i.e . the time after which the system will have producing enough energy to cover its own construction . for crystals silicon solar cells in central germany energy payback time is around # years . with the usual guaranteed lifetime of # years this leaves plenty of time for the c-si cells to actually producing electricity . <eos>

@highlight

<s> accounting for producing electricity solar power but slashes emissions <eos>
