<s> effects on wild fish : does fish farming harm wild fish ? <eos>

<s> overfishing means that natural stocks are currently severely depleted . for example cod may dies out completely in the south sea unless there are drastic cuts in the number caught . fish farming greatly reduces the need to catch wild fish . unless we stop eating fish fish farming is the only way to preserve wild fish . furthermore trawling in the oceans often results in bycatch where unwanted animals are needlessly caught in nets and killed ( e.g . dolphins and fish which are too small or from protected or uncommercial species ) . long line fishing for species like tuna leads to the death of billions of seabirds who are attracting to the floating bait on hooks trailed behind ships . none of this happens with fish <eos>

<s> fish farm do more to protect wild fish than to harm them . <eos>
