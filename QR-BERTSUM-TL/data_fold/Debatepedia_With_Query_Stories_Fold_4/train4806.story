<s> acting on speech : does `` bad '' speech lead to `` bad '' acts ? <eos>

<s> people who commit hate crimes are likely to have read hate speeches people who commit sex crimes are likely to have watched pornographic but not necessarily the other way around . audience of pornographic and readers of hate speeches are therefore not incited to commit anything they otherwise would not do . <eos>
