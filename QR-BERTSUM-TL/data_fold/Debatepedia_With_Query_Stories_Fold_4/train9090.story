<s> morality : is drug-use morally acceptable or tolerable ? <eos>

<s> consumption is wrong and should never be authorized . legalising drugs would only make them appear more acceptable . this would undermine health campaigns by suggesting that drugs are not too harmful or even harmless . <eos>

@highlight

<s> legalization would send the wrong message that drug-use is acceptable . <eos>
