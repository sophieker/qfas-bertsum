<s> was the genesis account of creation meant to be taken literally ? <eos>

<s> this was in the middle east at least as far back as 1000bc . they struggled to survive . they felt threatened by nature and desperately needed a story to put things into perspective . the genesis myth evolved because it was both simple and plausible considering the limited knowledge these people had . it fulfilled a psychological need for answers to troubling questions . the dire circumstances these people lived in did not offer room for debate or serious research nor for allegory or vaguely symbolic poetry . the stability of the tribe was at stake . if an authority figure told a story it had to leave no room for doubt . <eos>

@highlight

<s> genesis myth was created by primitive nomadic peoples . <eos>
