<s> life lost : was war worth the life lost ? <eos>

<s> iraqbodycount.org records that between # and # thousand iraqi civilian have been killed in the war in iraq between # and # . such a death toll is catastrophic outlandish and scandalous . almost every person in iraq - a country of # million - knows somebody that has been killed . no war of choice is worth this cost especially when the benefits were completely speculative . and even in the worst case scenario with saddam hussein staying in power death tolls approaching this kind of figure are hard to imagine . <eos>

@highlight

<s> war not worth approximately # # iraqi civilians killed . <eos>
