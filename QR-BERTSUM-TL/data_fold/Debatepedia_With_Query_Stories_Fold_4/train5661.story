<s> pakistani people : would the pakistani people react negatively ? <eos>

<s> the paksitani people seek a legitimate government that reflects its will . but the u.s. has been aiding musharaff a dictator so on the political front the people 's calls for democracy have been stifled to some degree by america . a unilateral u.s. action would add insult to injury in this regard as it would be a gross violation of pakistani sovereignty and another blow to the democratic movement of peoples to represent themselves . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a unilateral us strike would violate the pakistani movement to sovereign democracy . <eos>
