<s> upholding christianity : is creationism important to christianity ? <eos>

<s> the belief that god creates and sustains the world is not the same as the belief that god created the world in seven weeks a few thousand year ago . the former is a theological position which imply the goodness and sovereignty of god and his continuing involvement with his creation not a scientific claim . the however is an empirically falsifiable claim which has been empirically tests and found to be false . we should not allow schools to teach our children things that are just plain wrong and known to be wrong . this is distinct from allowing the teaching of religion which is culturally and historically significant and which involve beliefs which are in principle distinct from science . <eos>

@highlight

<s> creationism makes a false historical/scientific claims that is detached from the broader precepts of beliefs in god . <eos>
