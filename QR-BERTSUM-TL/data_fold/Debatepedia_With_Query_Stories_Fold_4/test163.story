<s> duties to iraqis ? would withdrawal shirk a duties to iraqis to stay in iraq ? <eos>

<s> iraq can not be taking in a moral vacuum . the we does not merely have an obligation to iraqis . it has an obligation to international security as well . the war in iraq has damaged the united states ' ability to uphold its obligations to maintaining international security . not only has it been a drain on resources and a distraction from we international obligations but it may even actually damage international security subsequently damaging the we obligation to upholding international security . any obligation to the iraqis can not be detached from these other obligations . by better enabling the we to live up to its global responsibilities withdrawing could uphold the principle of `` the greater good for the greater number '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the we has obligations to the world that should be regarded over obligations to just iraqis . <eos>
