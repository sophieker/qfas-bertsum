<s> colleges/applicants : should colleges search applicants profile on social networking sites ? <eos>

<s> imagining that colleges do search on social networking sites to find candidates it should be explained that only the applicants which have become a members of such sites would be seen and gain advantage . but what about those who do n't become a members in any of the social networking sites offered on the web ? the problems is that there are poor students out there who are really smart and deserve university admission but pity for them they do not have enough resources to get a computer and establish a personal profile on a social networking site . therefore a system in which colleges search for applicants will only promote an unfair admission of students . <eos>

@highlight

<s> admissions officers that search profiles putting those without accessing at a disadvantage . <eos>
