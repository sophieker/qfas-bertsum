<s> abuse : could legalization avoiding closing a slippery slope to abuse and murder ? <eos>

<s> there is very little historical evidence of physicians probably coercing patients into accept euthanasia against their will . part of the reason is that it is a major leap from patients having to request euthanasia to physicians forcing it upon them . it reality it is not a very plausible leap particularly with the number of checks that would be in places against such abuses upon legalization . <eos>

@highlight

<s> history does not suggest physicians coercing patients into abortion <eos>
