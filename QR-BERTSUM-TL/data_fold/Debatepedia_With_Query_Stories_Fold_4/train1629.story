<s> promises : was turkey promised membership in the eu ? <eos>

<s> turkey first applied to join the eu back in the 1960s but there is no document where eu leaders have promised to include turkey in the future . even if they had past declarations ( as opposed to treaties ) can not be held to bind today s leaders in weighing both their own national interest and the wider european interest . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the eu never promised membership to turkey . <eos>
