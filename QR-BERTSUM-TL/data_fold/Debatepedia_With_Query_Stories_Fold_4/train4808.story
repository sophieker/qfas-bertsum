<s> vs. national role : is un better than national government at addressing poverty ? <eos>

<s> poor national governments do not have the budgets to address systemic poverty among their peoples . that is why the un must intervene with support from wealthy countries . yet even still this support has not been enough and poverty remains widespread . the un therefore should increase its financial support of national governments to address local poverty . <eos>

@highlight

<s> poor governments can not address poverty alone need un . <eos>
