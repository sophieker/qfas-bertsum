<s> tax rebate : is the proposed tax rebate a good idea ? <eos>

<s> the tax rebate plan is based on a failed premise : that taxpayers will immediately spend the rebate money they receive on consumer goods . but with the current housing problems and huge debt the money will probably not be spent on consumer goods and rather to pay off loans . furthermore statistics show that americans are gradually saving and conserving their money more often which would be counter-productive to the plan . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tax rebates do not always lead to increased spending/stimulation <eos>
