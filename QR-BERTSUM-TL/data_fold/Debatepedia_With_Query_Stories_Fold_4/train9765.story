<s> naturally expansion : is the `` natural expansion '' of settlement justified ? <eos>

<s> the `` natural expansion '' of israel settlements is important to allow . this is a situation in which population growth as well as modest immigration into settlements expands a settlement modestly . it is instructive to consider what it would think to `` freeze '' such `` natural expansion '' . it would almost necessarily think placed limit on the number of offspring couples could have as well as the number of jews that can immigrate into a settlement . this is virtually infeasible . and for this reason the `` natural expansion '' of israel settlements should be allowed . <eos>
