<s> public health : does public health demand vaccinations ? <eos>

<s> researches show that alternative approaches towards diseases such as better nutrition homeopathy etc . give very positive results . healthier populations would not need vaccines to fight a disease . high profits that are now reserved only for the pharmaceutical industry would be spread to other areas of the economy such as agriculture and the service sector and more people would gain . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there are good alternatives to compulsory vaccination . <eos>
