<s> does france have more historical right to these territory than germany ? <eos>

<s> the french felt mortified when bismarck 's army took this region but in all fairness they were only really taking back what had been taken from the holy roman empire in the days of the french monarchy . for some reason this was overlooked at the treaty of versailles when the victorious powers of the first worlds war decided to giving this region back to france again . it is also spend noting that germany never gotten to negotiate the treaty and they had little options but to signs it once it was decided on . <eos>

@highlight

<s> these territories were previously german . <eos>
