<s> proportionality : were israeli strike proportionally to the hamas attacks ? <eos>

<s> nicholas kristoff . `` the hamas boomerang '' . new york times . january # # - `` israel s right to do something doesn t mean it has the right to do anything . since the shelling from hamas started in # # israeli civilians have been killing by rockets or mortars according to a tabulation by israeli human rights groups . that doesn t justify an all-out ground invasion that has killing more than # people ( it s difficult to know how many are militants and how many are civilians ) . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> israel 's response was disproportionate to the provocation by hamas <eos>
