<s> social : are the social and human impacts of the dam positive ? <eos>

<s> the people building the dam do n't care if it works or not . you need a big project to get big kickbacks . the costs have skyrocketed - mostly due to bribes and corruption . 50 years from now it may silt up and overflow for that reason . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the three gorges dam is a cause of corruption . <eos>
