<s> economic : would an independant scotland economically benefit ? <eos>

<s> oxford economics releases from time to time data on 'subsidisation ' . subsidisation is simply determined by the amount of tax raised and government expenditure spent in a given region in scotland this is probably quite close to zero ( and is incomparable to regions of england scotland and northern ireland ) . this does not include numerous other revenues streams from the scottish territories such as taxes on oil . in any case it is the south east that 'subsidises ' the rest of the uk . [ ... ] although it is reported that this subsidization does occur this can only be identified by what the london-based ( which is not a simplistic anti-english slur ) treasuries calls 'identifiable expenditure ' . `` unidentifiable expenditure '' includes for example the olympics development in london <eos>

@highlight

<s> the british are not really subsidizing the scottish . <eos>
