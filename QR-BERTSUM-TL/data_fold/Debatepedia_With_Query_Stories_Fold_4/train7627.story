<s> abandoned claims : did britain never abandoning its claim to the falklands ? <eos>

<s> any argument against britain allegedly abandon its claim to the falkland is negated by the fact that spain abandoned its settlements in the falklands in # . if both abandoned there claims for some period of when nor can use the other 's abandonment of the islands as findings for their side . if spain was the only one to abandoning its claim to the falkland britain can use this argument in its favor . <eos>
