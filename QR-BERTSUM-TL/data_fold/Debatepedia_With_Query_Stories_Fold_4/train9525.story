<s> punishment : do hate crimes deserve a higher level of punishment ? <eos>

<s> while much of the case for hate crimes is based on the notion that hate crimes cause minority groups and communities to fall victim to the fear that this violence causes it is not clear that this is any worse than the fear that results from senseless non-hate gang violence . all violence causes fear within communities . it is not clear that hate crimes cause more and that they thus deserve greater punishment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> communities fear senseless violence as much as hate violence . <eos>
