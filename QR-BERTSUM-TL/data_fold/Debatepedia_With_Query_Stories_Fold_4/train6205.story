<s> changing behavior : could an aircraft tax provide an incentive to make airplane engines more efficient ? <eos>

<s> as the popular of air travel continues to increase rapidly it is important to put pressure on the aviation industries to use gasoline as efficiently as possible so as to hold emissions down as much as possible . with fuels gasoline reserves running out gasoline conservation is also a wise use of finite resources . more expensive gasoline would give airlines an incentive to adopt the most modern technology and update their fleets . they could also adopt flying practices aimed at maximising gasoline efficiency -- e.g . flying at lower speeds even though journey times would be longer .

<s> taxing aircraft fuel would encourage greater fuel economic by making kerosene more expensive . <eos>
