<s> valley fills : are valley fills a major risk ? <eos>

<s> `` mongiardo leads defense of mountaintop removal . '' kentukians for the commonwealth . march 26th 2009 `` a distinction we try to make clear : a valley fill permit is not the same as a permit allowing the company to mine using mountaintop removal or any other mining method . those permits are usually issued by the state . valley fill or `` 404 '' permits ( referring to the section in the clean water act ) are issued by the corps of engineers . the epa has overall responsibility for enforcement of the cwa including some oversight authority over the corps ' actions . '' in other words mountaintop removal does not inherently involve valley fills . valley fills can be banned or avoided by coal companies without abandoning the practice of mountain top removal . <eos>
