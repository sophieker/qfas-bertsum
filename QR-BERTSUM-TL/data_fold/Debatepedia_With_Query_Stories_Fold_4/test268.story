<s> comment by a change is needed on barackobama.com : `` those against the president do n't seem to realize that he can only work with what he has . his executive powers to 'do things ' on his own are limited . that being said when you have a congress that from the outset pledged to do something that is moronic imho ... no tax increases at any cost say 'no ' to anything that he proposes and only pass bills that he ca n't sign because they do not help the country or represent the american people ... and then focus on anything that he is not doing ... that is just dysfunction . obama is doing the most he can with out currently dysfunction government . '' <eos>
