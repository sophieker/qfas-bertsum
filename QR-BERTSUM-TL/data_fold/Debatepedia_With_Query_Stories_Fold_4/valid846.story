<s> environment : is vegetarianism good for the environment ? <eos>

<s> good examples of environmentalist meat-eaters include theodore roosevelt and native american indians . these meat-eating-environmentalists appreciate the source of their meat the life-form that was behind it and acted to uphold a sustainable environmental balance . as long as you live up to these principles there is no contradiction between eating meat and being an environmentalist . <eos>

@highlight

<s> you don t have to be vegetarian to be an avid environmentalist . <eos>
