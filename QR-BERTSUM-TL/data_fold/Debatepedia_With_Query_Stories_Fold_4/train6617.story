<s> counter-terrorism : is pakistan failing to do enough making us intervention necessary ? <eos>

<s> pakistan has capture over # suspected militant terrorists since # . pakistanis are angry at apparent u.s. ingratitude considering that # # pakistan police officers and troops have died fighting extremists . vice musharaff has demonstrated his dedication to dismantling the taliban and al qaeda . this is within musharaff 's interests and it will typically destabilize the hold of radicals on the country and make it easier to determine the location of osama bin laden and lead to his capture . therefore president 's musharaff 's actions are consistent with the us war on terror and us desires to see osama bin laden brought to justice . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unilateral actions is not appropriate given that india is a key ally in the war on terror . <eos>
