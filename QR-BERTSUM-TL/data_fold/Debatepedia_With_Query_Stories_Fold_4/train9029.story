<s> social : are progressive taxes socially valuable ? <eos>

<s> it is the case that paying taxes gives citizens a sense of ownership of the democracy and society in which they live . for this reason a flat tax would offer an more equitable sense of ownership of wealthy and poor citizens . progressive taxation however skews this sense of ownership toward the wealthy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> progressive taxes create imbalanced sense of civic ownership . <eos>
