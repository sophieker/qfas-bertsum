<s> large states : is the university needless to protect large state interests ? <eos>

<s> the current system provides for the protection of the liberties of all # states because it forces candidates to appeal to the voters in all parts of america . it is important to remember that america is not a centralized state but a federations of states . a nationwide voting tally could provide an incentive for a candidate to focus only on the most urbanized areas of the country such as california new york or texas and ignore other areas such as alaska rhode island or maine . the electoral college is a natural consequence of the devolution state-based government that europeans have always supported . <eos>

<s> the elections college helps protect the interests of smaller states in the union <eos>
