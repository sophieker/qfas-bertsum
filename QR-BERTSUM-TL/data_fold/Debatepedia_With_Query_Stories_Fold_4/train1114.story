<s> corruption : do elections or appointments better avoid corruption ? <eos>

<s> the appointment of judges can be done corruptly in which a judge is appointed based solely on a close relationship or because their is some promise of financial reward for making the appointment . and after the election there is a risk that a judge will pass biased judgement in favor of the one that appointed them as a way of compensating them for the appointment . this is of at least equal concern compared to the possibility of corruption surrounding elections and judgments later passed in favor of campaign donors . what may make elections less potentially corrupting is the fact that the process of selecting the judge ( an election ) is much less likely to be biased or corrupt as compared to <eos>

@highlight

<s> appointment of judges is more prone to corruption than elections . <eos>
