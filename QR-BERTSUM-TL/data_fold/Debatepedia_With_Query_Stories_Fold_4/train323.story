<s> consistency : is tidal energy generation consistent reliable ? <eos>

<s> tidal power misses peak demand due to the 12.5 hr tides-cycle . peak demand around the world typically occurs in the middle of the day . yet tides flow fastest in the morning and at twilight . this means that tidal power is out of sink with every-day energy demands . <eos>
