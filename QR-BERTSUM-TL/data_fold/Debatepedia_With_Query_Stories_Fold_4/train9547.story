<s> victims ' families : do they favor juveniles being tried as adults ? <eos>

<s> our society is not based on inhumane lynch trials ; it is the judge ( jury in some cases ) who determines the appropriate punishment for a criminal ( delinquent ) that is in accordance with society 's values and morals . just because victims suffer after crime does not mean that offending juveniles should be - for example - sentenced to death especially if there is a real possibility of their reformation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> adequate punishment should not be dictated by victim 's families . <eos>
