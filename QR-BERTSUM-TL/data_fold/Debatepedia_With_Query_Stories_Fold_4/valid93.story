<s> environment : do advances in science harm the environment or do they rather help to protect it ? <eos>

<s> had n't it been for science we would be freely exacerbating natural resources emitting co2 emissions or killing endangered animals . thanks to science we are well aware of the risks and thus we are able to eliminate such harmful actions and - at the same time - implement necessary legislation in order to protect the environment ( such as kyoto protocol ) . had n't it been for science we would be ignorant of how much are we harming the nature . <eos>

@highlight

<s> science is the ultimate watch-dog . <eos>
