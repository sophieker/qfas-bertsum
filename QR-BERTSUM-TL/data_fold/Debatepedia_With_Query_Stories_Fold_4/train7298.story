<s> equal opportunity : is affirmative action necessary to achieve equal opportunity ? <eos>

<s> there are many ways in which society is unequal today and which can not change without institutional help : # . past historical discrimination severely limited access to educational opportunities and job experiences . # . ostensible measures of `` merit '' may well be biased toward the same groups who are already empowered . # . regardless of overt principles people in positions of power are likely to hire people they already know or people from similar backgrounds or both . this means that racism may not change on its own and requires an institutional approach such as affirmative action to level the playing field . <eos>

@highlight

<s> affirmative action is only way to level playing field <eos>
