<s> bad schools : do parents have a right to withdraw child from bad schools ? <eos>

<s> if that quality is sufficiently low in their eyes why shouldn t they be allowed to make the considerable sacrifice that becoming a home teachers constitutes ? a generation was failed by the british state educational system after the # s philosophy of children learning at their own pace permeated the teach profession : it s thoroughly reasonable for a parent to reject such methods ; if sufficiently able to pass tests the state wishes to impose concerning their capacity to fulfill the teach roles themselves why should they be denied that chance ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> children are titled to withdrawing children from bad state schools . <eos>
