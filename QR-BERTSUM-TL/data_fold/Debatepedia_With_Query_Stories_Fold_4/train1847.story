<s> emergency contact : in the events of a school-wide emergency ( a shoot etc . ) ? <eos>

<s> even a small amount of student calls could spark a panic among parents ; the last thing a swat team needs is a rushing of concerned parents blocking their way to the school . any operating cell phone presents an even more extreme danger : the waves emitted by cell phones can sets off bombs . having all the students ' cell phones on would definitely sets another off . <eos>

@highlight

<s> students cell phone use during emergencies does more harm than good . <eos>
