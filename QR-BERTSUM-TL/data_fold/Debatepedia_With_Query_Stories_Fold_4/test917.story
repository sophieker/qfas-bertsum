<s> pain : is it acceptable that circumcision is excruciating for infants ? <eos>

<s> it is acceptable to inflict some pains on an individual as a means to avoid potential pain . a great instance is vaccination in which the pains of the needle is justified by the potential avoidance of suffering . another great instance is a surgery to removing molars or to removing a failing appendix . <eos>

@highlight

<s> pain of neonatal circumcision helps avoiding future suffering . <eos>
