<s> democracy : is the superdelegate systems sufficiently representative and democratic ? <eos>

<s> this is based on the reason that party nominees are largely the internal affairs of political parties . if the party wanted to deny its people the right to vote in the primaries it would legally have the right to do so . but since this would upset voters and degrades the legitimacy of the nominee to voters in the general election such a courses of action is actually undesirable to the parties . nevertheless it is perfectly legal and appropriate for parties to limit voter power and democratic practices and uphold the independent voting rights of superdelegates in order to advance the internal interests of the political party . <eos>

@highlight

<s> secondary elections need not be fully democratic <eos>
