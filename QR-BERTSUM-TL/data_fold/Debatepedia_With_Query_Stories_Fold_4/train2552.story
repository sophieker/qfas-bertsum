<s> inspiration : would a mission to the moon be more inspiring ? <eos>

<s> going back to the moon is not an inspiring feet as it only archives what was already achieved in # over # years ago . this does not provide a sense of progress but rather a sense of stagnation . going to mars offers a sense of progress and the broadening of achievable horizons . in this sense only going to mars really scratches the human will to explore new territories and break down boundaries . returning to the moon does not . <eos>
