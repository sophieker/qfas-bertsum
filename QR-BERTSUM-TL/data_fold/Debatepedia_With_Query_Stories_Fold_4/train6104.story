<s> are muslims warriors in afghanistan and iraq terrorists ? <eos>

<s> what we need to see and understand is that these groups are fighting the nato or us or any other armies because their nation is under attack . it will be a very idiotic thought that a nation is attacked and its people will not forms groups to defend themselves . the talibans in iraq are known terrorists i wonder if us is attacked then similar groups there would be known terrorists groups or freedom fighters ? the fact remain that all of these groups in all regions are actually freedom fighter groups . if media of these western countries calling itself independant and thinks that its not under government influence then it should call these groups as freedom fighters instead of terrorists . <eos>

@highlight

<s> talibans from the iraq and similar groups from afghanistan are pejoratively to as terrorists . <eos>
