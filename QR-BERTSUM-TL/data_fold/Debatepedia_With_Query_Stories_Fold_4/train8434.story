<s> emergency : is abortions justification in order to saving the life of a mother ? <eos>

<s> opponent of abortion often argue that a foetus has an inviolate right to life . yet it is easy to demonstrating that this is not the case . it is always permissible to taking a life in self-defense . this principle can be applying to abortion . and importantly it also demonstrates that there is no such thing as an `` inviolable right to life '' . there are always conditional exceptions . so if we can show that the conditions are appropriate ( even beyond self-defense ) an abortion can be justified even if it is `` killing '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if abortions in self-defense is ok a fetus can not have a general right to lives <eos>
