<s> wwii was so long ago that these individuals were usually very young and of low rank . they be have had not choice in committing war crimes . if they had resisted they actually would have been killed so in effect they performed these act under duress . they were also frequently not english adding to the consideration that they ca n't be held fully responsible . most of the major figure responsible for atrocities are now dead . for this fact there is little remainder potential for justice to be furthered . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nazis war criminals uncovered now were usually just following order and so they are n't fully responsible for their acts : <eos>
