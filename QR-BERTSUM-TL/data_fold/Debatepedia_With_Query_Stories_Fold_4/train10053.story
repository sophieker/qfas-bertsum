<s> colonial legacy : does the common prosperity of nations promote an inappropriate colonial legacy ? <eos>

<s> it building upon the commonly links between the member nations nearly all of which have english as a major language and political and legal systems modelled upon the british precedent . today all the countries of the commonwealth have equal status and britain is no longer dominant in the way it was in the immediate post-colonial era . many of the members have entered through deliberate choice not just through an accident of history . countries such as uganda and cambodia which have no historic links to the british empire are also considering joining . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the commonwealth does not deny the injustices of history but instead transforms them positively into a strong and merited community : <eos>
