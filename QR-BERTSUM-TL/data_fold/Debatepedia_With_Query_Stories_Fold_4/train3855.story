<s> # war : were britain 's actions in the # wars illegitimate ? <eos>

<s> their sacrifices do not making british occupation of the islands legal . indeed britain s conduct of that war has been much questioned in particular the sinking of the argentine ship general belgrano when it was many mile from the fighting zone and heading away from it and the mysterious deaths of some surrendered argentine soldiers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> britain sent its soldiers to fight an unjust war in the falklands islands . <eos>
