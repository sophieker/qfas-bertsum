<s> crime : does capital punishment help protect the public and deter crime ? <eos>

<s> thomas r. eddlem . `` ten anti-death penalty fallacies '' . the new american . # june # - `` if capital punishment teaches that it 's permissible to kill do prison sentences teach that it 's permissible to hold someone against his will and do fines teach that it 's permissible to steal ? in actuality this fallacy confuses killing the innocent with punishing the guilty . to punish the guilty via the death penalty is not to condone the shedding of innocent blood . just the opposite in fact since capital punishment sends a strong message that murder and other capital crimes will not be tolerated . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> executions punish the guilty so ca n't encourage killing the innocent <eos>
