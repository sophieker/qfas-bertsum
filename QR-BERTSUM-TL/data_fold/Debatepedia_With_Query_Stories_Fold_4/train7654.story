<s> convention : is it importance that party leadership attend national convention ? <eos>

<s> the superdelegate system should not exist simply to send party leadership to the national convention . this is especially true if the system is considered undemocratic . the system will be viewed simply as a means of send democratic leadership to what is often viewed as a huge party and at the expense of democracy . this will further undermine voter self-confidence in the process . <eos>

@highlight

<s> superdelegates positioning at regional convention should not be a major consideration . <eos>
