<s> economics : is solar energy financially sound ? <eos>

<s> it is misleading to saying that sunlight electricity is free . the price of electricity resources have always been determined by cost of extracting the electricity and transform it into a consumable form . indeed oil is `` free '' to those that discover it but it is sold at a price related to the expense of extracting and refining the good . solar electricity is the same . the price of sun electricity is discovered in the expense of the technology and other factor involved in extracting it and transform it into a consumable form . it is not `` free '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> while sunlight is download the technologies for capture it is expensive . <eos>
