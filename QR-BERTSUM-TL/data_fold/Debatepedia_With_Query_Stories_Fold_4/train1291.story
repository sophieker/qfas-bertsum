<s> network owners : is net neutrality good for isps ? <eos>

<s> net neutrality rules will force network owners to constantly ask whether certain things they are doing are within fcc net neutrality non-discrimination regulations . blocking spam could be one example with the result being that isps spend too much money on ensuring they are safely within regulations when they could spend those resources in more productive ways . <eos>

<s> net neutrality will force isps to ask permission from fcc . <eos>
