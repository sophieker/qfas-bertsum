<s> geo-engineering ethics : is geo-engineering ethical ? <eos>

<s> it is impossible for humans to avoid geoengineering in the future . the earth 's climate has always shifted drastically throughout its history . the planet will for instance enter another ice age fairly soon . should we then just allow this to happen ? no particularly if it means sacrificing millions of human life and civilization as we know it . we should make the worlds work for us not allow it to obliterate us . and if we assume geoengineering is happenning then there is no morality boundary to doing it now when global warming poses the threat that does to human civilization . <eos>

@highlight

<s> irreversible climate change gives geoengineering unavoidable . <eos>
