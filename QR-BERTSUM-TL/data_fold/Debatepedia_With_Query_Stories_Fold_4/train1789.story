<s> feasibility and availability : <eos>

<s> trade does not exist in a vacuum . it needs a wider infrastructure to support it e.g . roads railways ports education to produce capable civil servants to administer trading rules etc . without foreign aid developing countries are not able to develop this kind of support and so can not participate effectively in international trade . aid is not always in the form of money - it may also be given through expert advisors who help countries prepare for the challenges of globalisation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> trade requires investment first . <eos>
