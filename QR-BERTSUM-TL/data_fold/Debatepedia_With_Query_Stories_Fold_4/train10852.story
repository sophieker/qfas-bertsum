<s> start point : is the gregorian calendars start points arbitrary ? <eos>

<s> however the gregorian calendars had its origins in christian history it has its own importance by now . a standards calendars for all race and faiths is utterly inappropriate ; different culture have different holidays and their calendars should be appropriate to their traditions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the julian start point is as good as any . <eos>
