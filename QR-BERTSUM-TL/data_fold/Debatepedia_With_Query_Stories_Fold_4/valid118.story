<s> interests : does bilateral trade better harness the individuals aid of states ? <eos>

<s> providers of aid for the very reason that they are spend their own money should have their interests better secured through a bilateral aid arrangement . significant opposition exists to foreign aid in the united states . for this reason it is important to demonstrate to the american public that their tax dollars are being spent in a way that benefits the nation and/or is used sensibly by the recipient nation . unfortunately many aid dollars have been wasted on countries with corrupted regimes that have misused the funds or the recipients have lacked the resources internally to use the funds productively . this misuse is more likely to happen if aid is channeled through and supervised by unaccountable international bureaucracies rather of given <eos>

<s> bilateral arrangements better upholding the interest of state funders . <eos>
