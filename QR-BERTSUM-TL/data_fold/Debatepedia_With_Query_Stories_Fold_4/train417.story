<s> economics : is nuclear energy economical ? <eos>

<s> mark hertsgaard . `` the true costs of nuclear power '' . mother earth news . april/may # : `` the best case against nuclear power as a global warming remedy begins with the fact that nuclear-generated electricity is very expensive . despite more than $ # billion in federal subsides over the past # years ( roughly # times more than solar wind and other renewable energy sources have received ) nuclear power still costs substantially more than electricity made from wind coal oil or natural gas . this is mainly due to the cost of borrowing money for the decade or more it takes to get a nuclear plant up and running .
