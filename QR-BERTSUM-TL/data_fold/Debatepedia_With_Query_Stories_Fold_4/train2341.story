'' lew rockwell . november # th # : `` there are two problems with that argument . being judged on the basis of your beauty is no more 'objectification ' than taking a college exam and being judged on your intellect ; yet as far as i know every student will take exams . moreover absolutely no data supports a connection between beauty pageants and violence against women .

<s> being judged on beauty no different than on academics . <eos>
