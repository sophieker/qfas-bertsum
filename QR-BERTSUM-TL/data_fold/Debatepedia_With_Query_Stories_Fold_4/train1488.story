<s> cultural freedom : does arranged marriage breach the principle of cultural freedom ? <eos>

<s> . even within any ethnic community there is variety and difference . it is misleading to treat all arranged marriages as one homogeneous system . although cross-cultural elements are a part of the debate this is more than the west versus the east old ways versus new ways or patriarchal culture dominating women . a part of the difficulty in understanding the variety of arranged marriages stems from the fact that many western cultures had arranged marriages or types of arranged marriages that were based on finance and patriarchy . this does not mean all arranged marriage systems function in such a manner . rather such a viewpoint may be a case of observer bias where western critiques only see arranged marriages through their own <eos>

<s> the matter may be of cultural freedom or multicultural freedom <eos>
