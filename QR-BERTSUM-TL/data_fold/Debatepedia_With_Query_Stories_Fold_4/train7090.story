<s> practicality : are hybrid vehicles practical ? <eos>

<s> this is a very small number of miles compared to ordinary gasoline vehicles which last around 300 000 miles . this means that an individual would have to more frequently bother with purchasing a new hybrid vehicle . and of course they would have to spend much more money over time . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hybrids are only built to last a paltry 100 000 miles . <eos>
