<s> civil war ? could an early withdrawal avoid causing a civil war ? <eos>

<s> while sunnis and shiites may have a history of animosity in the middle east generally iraqi sunnis and shiites have a history of tolerance as well as national unity and pride . in fact iraq has been know for a high level of shiite-sunni integration in its urban areas particularly in baghdad . while some shiites and sunnis are mortally pitted against each other in iraq the general feeling is not one of hatred making it unlikely that a civil war would emerge . <eos>

@highlight

<s> iraq 's sunnis and shiites have a history of tolerance not violence <eos>
