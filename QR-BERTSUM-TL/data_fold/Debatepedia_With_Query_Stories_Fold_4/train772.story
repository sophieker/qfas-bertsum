'' on to mars : `` when we compare our moon to mars we see that mars is too easy to terraform then the moon . the moon 's # day day-night cycles is unsupportable for plant and is n't comfortable for humans either . plant growth on a greenhouse on the moon would n't be possible either : solar radiation would destroy them and if the greenhouse was making to shield the solar radiation ( a very thick greenhouse ) the temperature differences would kill the plants : too too hot during day-time too too cold during the night .
