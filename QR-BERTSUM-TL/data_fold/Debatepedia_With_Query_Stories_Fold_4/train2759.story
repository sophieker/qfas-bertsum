<s> homosexual analogy : is legalize incest derive to legalize homosexuality ? <eos>

<s> homosexuality is typically a relationship between equal parties . incest contrarily is much more susceptible to abusive relationships between older and younger siblings grandfather and daughter or son and mother before these individuals could be considered `` consenting adults '' . it is this inherent prospect of abuse that makes incest different than homosexuality and compels the state to intervene . <eos>

@highlight

<s> incestuous relationships are more prone to abused than heterosexual ones . <eos>
