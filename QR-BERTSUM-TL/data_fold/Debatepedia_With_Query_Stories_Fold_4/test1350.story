<s> does evolutionary allow rooms for god ? <eos>

<s> god is all powerful . why could he want to create something imperfect and allow nature to take its course ? but if god directing all the process of evolution to create the creatures that he wanted it begs one big question : why did n't he create a perfect creatures to starting off with and save time ? the theory of macro-evolution if accept by believers always cause massive theological complications and awkwardnesses like this . <eos>

@highlight

<s> evolutionary enables little room for god . <eos>
