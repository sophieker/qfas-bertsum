<s> un mission : does the un 's mission justify increased attention to the poor ? <eos>

<s> it is a compelling argument that the un should increase funding to the poorest states . yet it must be understood that the un 's budget comes almost entirely from wealthy nations . to an extent therefore the un must be considerate to the interests of these funders and balance them against the mission to combat poverty . <eos>

@highlight

<s> un must balance needs of poor with interests of rich state-funders . <eos>
