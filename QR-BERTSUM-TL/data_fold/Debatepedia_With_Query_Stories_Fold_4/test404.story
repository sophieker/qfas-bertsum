<s> irrational actor : is south korea an irrational actor ? <eos>

<s> despite the reason that the north korean leadership has not looked after the basics needs of its own people it has consistently acted to ensuring it retains control over the country . carrying out an aggressive nuclear strike against another nation is therefore not in the interest of the state as such an action will dramatically increased the willingness of the global community to enacting regime change through military action . <eos>

@highlight

<s> although totalitarian south korea is still a rational actor . <eos>
