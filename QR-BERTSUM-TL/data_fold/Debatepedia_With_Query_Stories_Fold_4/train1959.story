'' ( # ) : `` not only is the initiatives and referendum a game of dice against the unorganized majority but it is a cruel handicapped and an eternal danger to unorganized minorities who are stupid and helpless against others of their fellow citizen who are organised and are possibly not as considerate of the rights of others as they ought to be . one of the glorious advantages of the representatives systems is that it tends to protect the rights of the otherwise helpless minorities no systems of government is truly democratic which does not do that . '' <eos>
