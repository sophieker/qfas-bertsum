<s> `` right to die '' ? does every citizen have a `` right to die '' at a time of choice ? <eos>

<s> the dignity and inviolability of life is an absolute principle . it does not matter if a dying someone does not appreciate that dignity and desires to be euthanized ; the dignity of their life and life in general still should be protected . <eos>

@highlight

<s> dignity of human life should override any individual will to be euthanized <eos>
