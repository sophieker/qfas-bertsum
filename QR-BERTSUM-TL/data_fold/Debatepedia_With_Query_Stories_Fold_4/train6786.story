<s> competition : is competition a worse really in health care ? <eos>

<s> the notions of the free markets as a source of efficiency dates back to adam smith . the healthcare care industry is no exception to this rule . if it is open to the laissez-faire consumers will shop for and purchase the best price and value . pressure will be placed on insurance companies to cut cost and sell their surface at a lower price for greater value . free universal healthcare care could interrupts this reduce efficiency and increased costs . <eos>

@highlight

<s> single-payer health care erodes competition in price and values <eos>
