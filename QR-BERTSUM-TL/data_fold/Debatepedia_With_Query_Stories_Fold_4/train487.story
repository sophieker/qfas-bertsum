<s> supply the poor : is public or private water the best way to supply the poor ? <eos>

<s> current regimes in developing countries often provide a state subsidy to the rich with water provided to middle-class areas and wealthy farmers at a fraction of its true cost while poorer areas have no supply at all . it is misleading to argue that privatising the water supply is bad because it will force the poor to pay for their water . the poor are already paying for their water either directly to entrepreneurs who carry it in pools and cans up to the hut towns or with their when as they spend a large proportion of the family 's labour fetching poor high-quality water from miles away . the poor also pay through ill health causing by poor high-quality water and bad sanitation ; <eos>

<s> treat water as an economy good will making water cheaper : <eos>
