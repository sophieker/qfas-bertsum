<s> international law : can assassinations of tyrants be justified in international law ? <eos>

<s> by what prerogative would the usa feel itself best placed to decide which democratically elected national leaders should be assassinated ? presumably such a decision would be based entirely on ideological grounds ( as far as the media and the publicj were concerned ) and economic grounds ( as far as the politicians and their corporate bosses were concerned ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assassination attempts are driven by invalid ideological considerations . <eos>
