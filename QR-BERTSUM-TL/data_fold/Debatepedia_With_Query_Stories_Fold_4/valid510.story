<s> socio-economic arguments -- would society benefit in general from a ban on partially birth abortions ? <eos>

<s> where not only will the child suffer but societies when that child develop a higher attraction to crime welfare etc . ... without legalized abortion a lot more women will become parents whether or not they need to be and whether or not they 're ready to be . raising a child properly is a full-time labor rigorous process . the children who are neglected or abused are usually the ones that grow up to be drug addicts lifelong government aid recipients and criminals . do we need to subject the child to such misery ? do we need to saddle societies with the added burden ? some people say 'what if abe lincoln 's dad had an abortion ? ' . you could also ask 'what if adolf hitler 's or hussein <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` it 's arguably better for society to have babies abort than have them be brought up bad and overlooked <eos>
