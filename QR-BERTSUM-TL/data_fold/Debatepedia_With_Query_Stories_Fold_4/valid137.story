<s> performance : do electrical car perform well ? <eos>

<s> electrical cars actually have a much higher acceleration-rate than fuel cars . this is because they have a high levels of torque that has no regard to the thermal curve of gasoline . this is why electrical cars do not require gears boxes . and it should be noted the need to shift gears slows the acceleration of a car . <eos>

@highlight

<s> electric cars can accelerating slower than gasoline cars . <eos>
