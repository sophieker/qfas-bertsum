<s> vs. upgrading : negev better than upgrading old infrastructure ? <eos>

<s> railroad tracks permit a far higher throughput of passengers per hour than a roads the same width . a high speed rail needs just a double track railway one track for each direction . a typical capacity is # trains per hour and # passengers per train ( as for the eurostar sets ) which implies a capacity of # # passengers per hour in each direction . by ways of contrast the highways capacity manual gives a maximum capacity for a single lane of highways of # # passenger cars per hour ( excluding trucks or rvs ) . assuming an percentage vehicle occupancy of # . # people [ # ] a standard twin track railway has a typical capacity # % greater than a # -lane highways ( # lanes each way ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> high-speed railway has higher capacity than roads . <eos>
