<s> is rehab a more just objectives than retribution ? <eos>

<s> the purpose of punishment is to shows disapproval for the offender s wrongdoing and to clearly denounce his criminal actions . this is why we punish ; we punish to reprimand ( retribution ) we do not punish merely to helping a person change for the better ( rehabilitation ) . we still have to punish a robber or a murderer but if he is truly sorry and but if he would really really never offend again and but if we could somehow tell that for certain . this is because justice and not rehabilitation makes sense as the justification for punishment . why is justice and reprimand ( retribution ) so important ? because unless the criminal justice system responds to persons who have violated societies s rules by <eos>

@highlight

<s> punishments signals obviously that particular conduct is wrong . <eos>
