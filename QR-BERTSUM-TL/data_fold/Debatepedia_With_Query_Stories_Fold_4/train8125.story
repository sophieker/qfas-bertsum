<s> naturally fuel vehicles : are naturally fuel vehicles a great idea ? <eos>

<s> the wall street journal quoted a california energy commission : `` when natural gas replaces fuel greenhouse gases are reduced by just # to # % . when natural gas is used instead of diesel in trucks greenhouse gases are reduced just # to # % . if diesel is almost comparable then it makes more sense to fund that as a stop gap as that infrastructure is already in place . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> naturally gas certainly reduces emissions compared to fuel and diesel . <eos>
