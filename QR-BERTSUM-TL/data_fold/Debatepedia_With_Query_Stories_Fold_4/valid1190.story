<s> war on terror : is it wrong to think the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> the terrorists in iraq are just waiting for the america states to leave . when they exit they will launch a massive campaign against the iraqi government partly predicated on the notions that the iraqi government is an illegitimate stooge of the america states and also on the notions that its democratic practices are contrary to the caliphate that they seek to establish . <eos>

@highlight

<s> once the us leaves terrorists will launch a huge violence campaign . <eos>
