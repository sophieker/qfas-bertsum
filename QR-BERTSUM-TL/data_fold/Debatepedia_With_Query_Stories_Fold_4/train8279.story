<s> israel : is criminalizing of holocaust denying necessary to protect israel ? <eos>

<s> there are many statements made in the world that go directly against the interests of other states or even directly threaten the integrity and sovereignty of another state . many argue for example that serbia does not have a legitimate claim to independence . yet statements by such persons are not made illegal on the basis that they are threatening to the states in question . on this basis holocaust denying in so far as it undermines the basis for israel 's creation and existence is not exceptional and can not be made illegal on these grounds . <eos>

@highlight

<s> genocide denying can not be criminal on basis of protecting israel . <eos>
