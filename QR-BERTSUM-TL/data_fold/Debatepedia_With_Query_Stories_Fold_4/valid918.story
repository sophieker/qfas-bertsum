<s> alternatives : are the alternatives to the primaries inadequate ? <eos>

<s> the specific alternative model of allowing small states to go first provides a chance for particular candidates to start a campaign in smaller states with fewer funds . they can build their support so they can actually succeed in getting votes from the bigger states . by allowing this to happen large billion dollars worth campaigns will not be the only possible way to be a presidential candidate . the big money behind campaigns generally enhance the special interest effect of certain groups or individuals that have founded campaigns and later may be able to get benefits trough policies or legislation . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rotating regional primaries solve the problems of the current process <eos>
