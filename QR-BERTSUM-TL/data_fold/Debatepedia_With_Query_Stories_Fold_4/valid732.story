<s> fair ? would a taxes on aviation be fair ? <eos>

<s> faced with higher cost airlines will pass these on to their customers in the form of higher ticket prices . even amongst those who can afford air travel the rich consume many more flights than the than well off so a rough equity could be achieved . in any cases the sums involved are unlikely to prevent anyone flying off on an annual holiday as even a # % rise in air fares could be than than # % of the total cost ( including hotels meals etc . ) of the whole experience .

@highlight

<s> a taxes on aviation gasoline would be progressive and reasonable as the very poorest are already unable to afford air <eos>
