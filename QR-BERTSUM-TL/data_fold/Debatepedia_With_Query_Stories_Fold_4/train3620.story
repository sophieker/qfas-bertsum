<s> equality : which is better at fostering equality dealing with inequality ? <eos>

<s> as franklin b. roosevelt 's famed saying goes : `` capitalism is unequally divided riches while socialism is equally divided poverty . '' in other words socialism may be more equal but that is not a better result when everyone is poor . it is better that there be some inequality under capitalist when everyone is more wealthy and prosperous . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism is unequal riches ; communism is equal poverty <eos>
