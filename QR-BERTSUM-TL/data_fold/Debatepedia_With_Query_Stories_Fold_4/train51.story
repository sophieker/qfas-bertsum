<s> foetus rights : is it mistake to assigning rights to the fetus ? is it not a person ? <eos>

<s> ronald reagan . new york times . september # nd . # - `` i 've noticed that everybody that is for abortions has already been born . '' [ # ] in other words the unborn could all be against abortions but of course they ca n't express their opinion as for/against abortion . it is importance to protect such a voiceless minority in society . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the unborn are voiceless and should be protected against abortions <eos>
