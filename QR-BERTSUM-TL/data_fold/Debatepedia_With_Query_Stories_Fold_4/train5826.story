<s> smegma : is it a good or bad thing that circumcision eliminates smegma ? <eos>

<s> this question is pointless because once the foreskin becomes fully mobile washing under it is utterly trivial . to circumcise to prevent smegma would be like ripping out the nails to prevent dirt under the nails . <eos>

@highlight

<s> mobile adult foreskin is very easy to clean . <eos>
