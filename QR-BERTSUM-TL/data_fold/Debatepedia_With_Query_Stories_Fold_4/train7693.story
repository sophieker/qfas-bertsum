<s> scott bidstrup . `` gay marriage : the arguments and the motives '' : `` # . making love to one man betrays everything that is masculine . well i 've known ( and dated ) plenty of very masculine gay men in my day including bull-riding rodeo cowboys and a hell 's angel biker type who if you suggested he is a limp-wristed fairy would likely rip your heads off and hand it to you . there was a long-honored tradition of gay relationships among the tough and macho cowboys of the old west and many diaries exist detailing their relationships . plenty of masculine foremost movies stars are gay . indeed rocks hudson was considered the very archtype of a masculine man . came as quite a shock to a lot of macho-men <eos>

@highlight
