<s> globally warming : do natural fuel vehicles help cut emissions fight globally warming ? <eos>

<s> the wall street journal quoted a california energy commission : `` when natural fuel replaces gasoline greenhouse gases are reduced by just # to # % . when natural fuel is used instead of diesel in trucks greenhouse gases are reduced just # to # % . if diesel is almost comparable then it makes more sense to fund that as a stop gap as that infrastructure is already in place . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> natural gas hardly reduces emission comparable to petrochemical <eos>
