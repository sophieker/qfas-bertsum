<s> vs `` non-treatment '' : is euthanasia better than withdrawing life support ( non-treatment ) ? <eos>

<s> this means that withdrawing life-sustaining should never be equivalent in intent to euthanasia . that is it should never have the explicit purpose of ending a life . in terri shiavo 's case for instance the explicit purpose of withdrawing life-sustaining was to end her life . this was wrong and is the reason why it was so widely opposed . instead withdrawing life support or denying it from the beginning must be about a wider desires to for instance live life natural and no artificial support spend as much time as possible with family no the interruption of life-sustaining or to live life natural no the interruptions discomfort or pain of life support . and of courses withdrawing or denying life-sustaining can which including death <eos>

@highlight

<s> withdrawing life-support should not be to ends lives but for other purpose <eos>
