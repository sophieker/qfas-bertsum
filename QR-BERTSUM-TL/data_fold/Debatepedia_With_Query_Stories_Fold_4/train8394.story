<s> in democracies ? -- is civil disobedience each justification in a functioning democracy ? <eos>

<s> but this is a false choice as in the real world campaigns of civil disobedience have not lead to the breakdown of law and order typically or the collapse of the state . those who advocates civil disobedience are usually careful to set boundaries on their actions setting out what kind of disobedience is justification and what is unjustifiable . martin luther king for example held that justice demanded that unjust laws ( i.e . segregation laws ) be broken but that just laws ( e.g . against trespass violence against property or the person ) must be upheld .

<s> given a choice chaos is to be preferred to despotism . <eos>
