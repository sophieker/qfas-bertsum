<s> `` keep '' : does `` keep '' in the # nd amendments referring to an individual right to `` keep '' ? <eos>

<s> it is possible that the intention of the second amendments was for community to constitute `` keep '' in storage their weapons but not necessarily for them to keep these weapons in their homes as personal possessions . it should be considered that a keep is noun referring to a place of safe storage . to keep then to some regard has the notion of safe storage associated with it . thus a right to keep arm could simply mean the right to keep weapons in community safe storage . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` keep '' would confer only a collective way to keep and store not a personal right . <eos>
