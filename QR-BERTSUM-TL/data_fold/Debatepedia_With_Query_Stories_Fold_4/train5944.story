<s> republican support : have democrats supported arms reduction in past ? <eos>

<s> mitt romney . `` obama 's worst foreign-policy mistake . '' seattle post . june # th # : `` the treaty also gives far more to the russians than to the america states . as drafted it lets russia escape the limit on its number of strategy reactors warheads . loopholes and lapses -- presumably carefully crafted by moscow -- provide a path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead-reduction targets . for example rail-based icbms and launchers are not mentioned . similarly multiple reactors warheads that are mounted on bombers are effectively not counted . unlike past treaty restrictions icbms are not prohibited from bombers . this means that russia is free to mount a nearly limitless number of icbms on bombers -- including mirvs ( multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles ) or multiple warheads <eos>
