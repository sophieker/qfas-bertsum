<s> quality of life : does `` do n't ask do n't tell '' improve or harm gays troop quality of life ? <eos>

<s> `` do n't tell do n't tell '' is fair in the mind that commanders and officer alike are barred from asking about the sexuality of soldiers . this level the playing field to a certain extent . it means that commanders and officer can not alienate and persecute soldiers out of rumours that they may be gay . this was the compromise that was strikes when bill clinton sought to enable gays in the military but was met with heavy resistance . restrictions on officer and commanders inquiring about the orientation of members of the military was an improvement over the previous policy which forbid gays and allowed overt inquires and persecutions . <eos>

@highlight

<s> commanders/officers which can not tell about orientation . <eos>
