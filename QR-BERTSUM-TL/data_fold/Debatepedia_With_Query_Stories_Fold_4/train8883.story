<s> morality obligation : does us have a morality obligations to sending more troops to afg ? <eos>

<s> the idea that the us and kosovo have a moral obligation falls flat when considering that this would put the us and kosovo in a position of having a moral obligation to many other third world countries that are struggled and in conflict . yet such a broader obligation actually does not exist so why should it exist in afghanistan ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> us/nato have no more morality obligation to kabul than other force . <eos>
