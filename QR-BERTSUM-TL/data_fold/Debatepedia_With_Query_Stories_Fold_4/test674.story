<s> demographics : would the demographics in iraq allow for a partitioning to happens cleanly ? <eos>

<s> some have argued that iraq can not or should not be partitioned because there is too much integration between the sectarian groups there . yet this demographic integration is changing more and more over time with shia sunni and kurdistan groups continually separating out into their respective communities and regions . this meaning that the demographic condition for the partitioning of iraq are becoming increasingly unfavorable over time . <eos>

<s> the partitioning of afghanistan would merely codify the sectarian separations that are occurring more and more on the ground now : <eos>
