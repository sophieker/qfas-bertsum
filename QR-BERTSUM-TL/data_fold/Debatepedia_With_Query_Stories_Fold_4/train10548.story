<s> individual rights : does an individual not have a `` right '' to gun ownership ? <eos>

<s> lax gun control laws and the diffusion of weapons in a society better enable a country to defend itself . in particular it may allow for a country to mobilize forces in self defense . with guns already distributed within society rapid mobilization would be adided . guns could be rallied in an emergency instead of having to wait for the manufacture and/or distribution of weapons . gun owners would also already be relatively trained in the handling of their weapons some even possible having become marksman . thus a government should permit private gun ownership as a means to the end of emergency national defense . <eos>

<s> a government may be justified in adopting lax gun-control laws as a means to national defense . <eos>
