<s> maintenance : are tides electricity plants easy and cheap to maintain ? <eos>

<s> repairing tidal energy systems underwater is very challenges and expensive as is repairing anything underwater . the problem is that it requires a combination of divers and submarine equipment both of which are expensive . this is all compounded by the reason that proposed tidal energy plants are generally located in environments with the most violence tides . the masses of water moving via tides can easily damage and corrode tidal energy systems . <eos>
