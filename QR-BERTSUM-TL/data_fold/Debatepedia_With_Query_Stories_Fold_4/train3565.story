'' . heritage foundation . 8 mar . 2002 - `` cafe is a solution in search of a problem . is the problem global warming ? is it energy security ? is it traffic congestion and air pollution ? or is it simply the envy of some people who ca n't afford to buy large suvs ? i think that i can say confidently that except for perhaps a subset of that last problem cafe is not the right solution to whatever the problem advocated is .
