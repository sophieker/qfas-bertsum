<s> market prices : do market prices making sense ? <eos>

<s> in capitalism the markets determines prices including pay -- the prices of labour . if some those are paid huge sums that is because other those believe they have unique talents which are worth paying for . if they fail to perform then they will stop being rewarded so highly . this is all part of a dynamic capitalist system which values uniqueness and rewards ability and risk-taking . <eos>

@highlight

<s> market prices are never fair prices . <eos>
