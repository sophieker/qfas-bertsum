<s> society : does the burqa ban improve social strength ? <eos>

<s> monty self . `` burqa ban will erode mutual understanding . '' ethics daily . april # # : `` banning the burqa on grounds that it is not french that it destroys the french ideal that it is not compatible with french culture is just as damaging . this position fails to acknowledge the evolution of society . cultures always evolve . the hyper-protection of the current state of a society only reveals our own assumptions of superiority . it reveals that we think ourselves better than the rest of the world . the danger here is that one day we will be surpassed and ultimately subjugated by those whom we rejected . our current culture will cease to evolve and be left behind .
