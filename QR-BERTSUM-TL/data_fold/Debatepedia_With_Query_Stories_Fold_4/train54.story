<s> james boyle . `` the initiative and referendum : its folly fallacies and failure . '' ( 1912 ) : `` not only is the initiative and referendum a game of dice against the unorganized majority but it is a cruel handicap and an eternal danger to unorganized minorities who are dumb and helpless against others of their fellow citizens who are organized and are possibly not as considerate of the rights of others as they ought to be . one of the glorious advantages of the representative system is that it tends to protect the rights of the otherwise helpless minorities no system of government is truly democratic which does not do that . '' <eos>
