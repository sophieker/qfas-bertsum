<s> science : does a unmanned missions to mars have scientific value ? <eos>

<s> glenn zorpette . `` why go to mars ? '' scientific american . march # : `` another reason why humans may have to be on sites to conduct a thorough search for life stems from the fact that if any such life exists it is probably deep underground . anticipated probes will be equiped with robotic assembly that can bore several centimeters into rocks or dig a few meters down into the soil . but barring any discovery at those shallow depths researchers will have to bring up samples from hundreds of meters below the surface guess even one or two kilometres down before they can declare mars dying or alive . drill for samples at such depths 'most likely will require humans ' says charles elachi director <eos>
