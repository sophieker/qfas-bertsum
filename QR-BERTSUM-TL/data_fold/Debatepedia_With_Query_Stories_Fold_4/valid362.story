<s> james surowiecki . `` the a.i.g . bonuses and altruistic punishment '' . new yorker . march # # - `` when it goes to the a.i.g . bonuses the costs of clawing them back are trivial at best while the public satisfaction at seeing what feels like justice being served will be great . getting all worked up about this money may not purely speaking be rational but i think that conversely if some of this money is clawed back it ll increased the chances that we ll be able to keep dealing with the on-going crisis in a rational way in the future .
