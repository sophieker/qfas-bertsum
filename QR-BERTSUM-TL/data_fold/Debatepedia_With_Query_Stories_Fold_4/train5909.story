<s> societal argument - would society benefit in general from a ban on partially birth abortions ? <eos>

<s> where not only will the child suffering but society when that child develops a higher attraction to crime welfare etc . ... without legalized abortion a lot more women will become children whether or not they want to be and whether or not they 're ready to be . raising a child properly is a full-time labor intensive process . the children who are overlooked or abused are usually the ones that grow up to be drug addicts life-long government aid recipients and criminals . do we want to subject the child to such misery ? do we want to saddle society with the added burden ? some people say 'what if abe lincoln 's mom had an abortion ? ' . you could also ask 'what if adolf hitler 's or saddam <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` it 's arguably better for society to have babies abort than have them be brought up bad and overlooked <eos>
