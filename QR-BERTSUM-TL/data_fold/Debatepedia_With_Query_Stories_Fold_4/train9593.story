<s> democracy : is the superdelegate system adequately representative and democratic ? <eos>

<s> party activists who more often seek to becoming delegates are generally more liberal or conservative than the bases of their parties . therefore elected delegates end up being unrepresentative of the bases of the parties . in this sense the elected delegate system is somewhat undemocratic . the superdelegates system was designed in part to helping ensure that delegates at the national conventions were more representatives of their parties . <eos>

@highlight

<s> superdelegate provide higher mainstream party representations <eos>
