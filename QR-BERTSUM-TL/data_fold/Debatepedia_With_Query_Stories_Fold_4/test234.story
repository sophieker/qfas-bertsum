<s> fairness : are hate crime laws fair and judicially sound ? <eos>

<s> it is very difficult to oppose hate crime laws as they are intuitively attractive and are highly important to minority group constituents while being more under-the-radar for the general public . therefore the tendency is for hate crime laws to pass with little opposing consideration . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hate crime laws are politically motivated <eos>
