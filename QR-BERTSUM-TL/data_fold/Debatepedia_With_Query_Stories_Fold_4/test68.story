<s> capital flight : does a caps on overseas investments help limit the potential for fast capital flight ? <eos>

<s> given that there is a limit on investment any existing foreign investors will think carefully before withdraw funds from the economy . given that they can quickly withdraw and redeploy ( in good times ) in other economies they will not be as keen to withdraw from an economy where subsequent redeployment may turn out to be much more difficult .

@highlight

<s> a cap acts as a disincentive to speedy withdrawal of funds . <eos>
