<s> private opinion : where does private opinion stand on this issue ? <eos>

<s> justice is justice and judicial process is judicial process . this is the case no matter where public opinions stands on an issue . if it is way to try a terrorist in military courts than this should be done irrespective of what the public thinks . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public opinions irrelevant to merits of civilian trials of terrorists . <eos>
