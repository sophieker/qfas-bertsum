<s> sustainability : is nuclear energy sustainable long-term ? is it `` renewable '' ? <eos>

<s> nuclear power plants are only 35 % thermally efficient . this means for every kilowatt of electricity produced almost twice as much waste heat is generated . nuclear plants require significant quantities of water to remove the waste heat - usually into the environment . such demands on water resources are impractical harm agriculture and general raise water utility prices . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear energy requires substantial water to cool the reactor <eos>
