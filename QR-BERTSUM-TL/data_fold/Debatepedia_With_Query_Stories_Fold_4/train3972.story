<s> what does the scripture saying on the subject ? <eos>

<s> the bible says that god create anything perfect but darwin 's theory maintains that the first organisms were the simplest ones and thus clearly imperfect . also the bible says that death started at the fall but evolutionists say that survival of the fittest ( which involves death of the unfit and imperfect ) has been going on since well before mankind arrived on the scene and thus before the fall . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the biblical account of created flies firmly in the faces of macroevolutionism . <eos>
