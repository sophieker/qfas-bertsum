<s> responsibility : are nations responsible for historical debt ? <eos>

<s> this thinking has danger implications on an international level . governments are always changing in democracies but nations are expected to honour their debts . a crucial element in lending money is contractor s promise the promise that the debt will be pay back . if every new government could decide that it was not responsible for its predecessor s debts then no-one could ever lend money to a country as there could be little chance of repayment . developing countries in particular but need loan in order to invest in infrastructure projects . cancelling debt now could make lenders far less likely to provide loan on good terms in the future and could retard economy growth in the long term . <eos>
