<s> cuban harms : do sanctions significantly harm cubans ? <eos>

<s> cuba 's human rights violations are not merely a factor of capricious actions being taken by the cuban regime . rather human rights violations are enshrined in cuban law . the cuban constitution does protect certain individual freedoms but then nullifies them when they are contrary to `` the goals of the socialist state `` `` socialist legality `` or the `` people 's decision to build socialism and communism .
