<s> assistance misuse and corruption vs trade drawbacks : <eos>

<s> there is a short term danger that a flood of cheap ( because of developed world subsidies ) imports will wreck local industry who are unable to compete fairly . in the longer term economies may become dangerously dependent forth `` cash crops '' or other commodities producing purely for export ( e.g . rubber coffee cocoa copper zinc ) rather than becoming self-sufficient . such economies are very vulnerable to big swings on the international commodity markets and can quickly be wrecked by changes in supply and demand . <eos>

@highlight

<s> exposing fragile developing economies to free trading is very risky . <eos>
