<s> chris stites . `` how corporations became persons . '' uu worlds : `` democracy expresses the collective consciences of citizens . however noble or flawed its message this is how our nation 's moral voice is heard . [ ... ] corporations express the collective investment goals of shareholders . the law stricture called as fiduciary responsibility confines all but closely held corporations to this peculiar goal . by shutting off other values to focus solely on pursuit of profit in inherently amoral economic competition corporations are by their nature amoral as well . despite image-enhancing claims of corporate citizenship they have no consciences to express only earnings per share . they differ from people not only in forms and size but most importantly in their fundamental character : people including corporate executives employees <eos>
