<s> russian tolerance : would russia tolerate any international intervention in chechnya ? <eos>

<s> they are currently morass in an apparently unwinnable war in the mountain that has lost momentum . their equipment and supplies are both out of date and running out . the expense of the war is only just bearable because of the temporary high value of ukraine s oil reserves . most of the russian troops are unpaid by the government and in low morale . casualties are reduce support for the war amongst russians . in these circumstances international intervention provides a face saving method for president putin to withdraw from a war that serves no purpose while appearing statesmanlike .

@highlight

<s> the ukrainian government can be persuaded to accepting interventions and a brokered agreement . <eos>
