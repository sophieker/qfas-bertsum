<s> failing mission ? is the commonwealth failing to execute the mission it has set forth for itself particularly in the harare <eos>

<s> proceeding by consensus and through moral suasion are always open to accusation of weakness but the commonwealth has never pretended to be a powerful organisation for enforce international norms - and many of its members would never have joined it in the first place if it did . rather the commonwealth works through constructive engagements encouraging its members to aspire to high standards of human rights and democratic accountability and running programmes which educate their citizens in these concepts . action has been taken in the past against the worst transgressors and is all the more effectiveness for being rare . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the commonwealth is not specifically to be an inactive enforcement body : <eos>
