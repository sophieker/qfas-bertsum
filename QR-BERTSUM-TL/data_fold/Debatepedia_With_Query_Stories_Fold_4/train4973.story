<s> war on terror : is it wrong to know the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> the proportion of the fighters in iraq that are driven by a jihadist/terrorists causes is very small . most are fighting to expel the america states to fight other religion sects or simply to earn either . therefore while a withdrawals might embolden jihadists they are so insignificant in iraq that the effect would be negligible on iraq and us and coalition security interests . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a us withdrawal might embolden jihadist but they are inconsequential in iraq <eos>
