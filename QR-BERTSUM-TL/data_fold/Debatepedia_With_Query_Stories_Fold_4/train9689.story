<s> serving justice : can justice be further serve by prosecuting wwii war criminals ? <eos>

<s> if the evidence had been available at the end of the war they would have been prosecuted then . no matter how long months these crimes were committing their horrific nature can leave no doubt that their perpetrators should be hunted to the ends of the earth . we should do justice equally to all war criminals or we are tolerably allowing that fleeing justice is a valid option for avoiding prosecution . no law system can establish such a precedent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> that time has elapsed is not a legal defence for wars criminals : <eos>
