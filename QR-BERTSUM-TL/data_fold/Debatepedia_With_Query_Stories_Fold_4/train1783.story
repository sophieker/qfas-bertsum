<s> economics : does the `` invisible hand '' solve everything ? <eos>

<s> consideration of one 's personal benefit may lead to negative externalities and thus to overconsumption as people very often fail to realize all of the repercussions of their behavior . ( e.g . a dog owner will `` weigh the price of the dogs their food their health health etc . against the joy he receives from owning them '' [ princeton review : cracks the ap economics macro and micro exams # edition ] but at the same time he will not consider the costs imposed on his neighbors ( barking biting droppings ) . this means that the owner will purchase the number of dogs that would suit him although the optimal quantities for the society is lower . ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> positive externalities . <eos>
