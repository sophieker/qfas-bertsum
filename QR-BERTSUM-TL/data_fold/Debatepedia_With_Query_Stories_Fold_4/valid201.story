<s> abandoned claims : did britain ever abandon its claim to the falklands ? <eos>

<s> . this agreement could only be cancelled by agreement of the two nations . as long as spain had rights the british had rights too . physical abandonment does not mean political abandonment in a sovereignty case regardless . <eos>

@highlight

<s> britain secured it 's rights with the spanish in the 1771 agreement <eos>
