<s> feminists : do feminists supporting legalization ? <eos>

<s> the majority of prostitutes are women . once the danger of abuse from male clients and pimps are removed the capacities of women to control the sexual responses of men in a economically beneficial relationship is liberating . additionally many campaigners for the rights of prostitutes note that the hours are relatively short the work well-remunerated and the services they offer are ones that other women are compelled to provide no charge . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many libertarian feminists consider that prostitution reflects the autonomy and dominance of modern women . <eos>
