<s> society welfare : should migrants receive equal treatments on society welfare ? <eos>

<s> immigrants make heavier use of social welfare systems and often overload public education while frequently not fully pulling their weight in taxes . increasing social and economic protections and rights for migrant via the migrants employees convention could increase migration and increase the benefits migrant receive from societies . this could be a burden that a state 's welfare systems is not capability of handling . <eos>

@highlight

<s> welfare system want protecting from `` freeriding '' migrants . <eos>
