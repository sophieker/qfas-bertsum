<s> inspiration : would a missions to the moon be more inspiring ? <eos>

<s> humans were last present on the moon 's surface in # . that was a short time ago . with all the major advances in technology that have taking places since then it is time that humans return to the moon 's surface . this is almost an issue of simply asserting that in the many decades that have passed the tasks of returning to the moon can be done again and with much greater ease than in # . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it 's when for beings to return to the lunar after decades away . <eos>
