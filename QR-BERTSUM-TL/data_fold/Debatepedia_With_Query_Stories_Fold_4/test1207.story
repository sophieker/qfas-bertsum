<s> school : is it appropriate to bans head scarves in public schools ? <eos>

<s> in a multicultural society students should be aware of the different religious practices and cultural traditions of their classmates and be taught to understand and respect these . without such respect muslims and other groups with distinctive dress such as orthodox jews and sikhs will be driven out of mainstream education and forcing to educate their children separately which will really creating divisions and alienation . as for the so-called safety issue most classroom accidents occur when pull long hair gets caught in machinery or in a flame - not a problem when hair is holding in place under a headscarf ! <eos>

@highlight

<s> schools make up problems about the headscarf as an excuses for intolerance of muslims . <eos>
