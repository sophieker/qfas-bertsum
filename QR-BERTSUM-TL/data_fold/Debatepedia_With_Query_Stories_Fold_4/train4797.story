<s> compromise : are health insurance cooperatives a good compromise ? <eos>

<s> many senators argue that there are not enough votes for a public plan ( 60 are needed for a `` filibuster proof '' majority ) . this is foolhardy because if such senators decided to vote in favor of the plan they could sway the difference in favor of the bill . voting no because `` others will vote no '' is therefore a foolish self-fulfilling prophecy . it is also clearly un-principled and based solely on `` the political winds '' of the time . senators should vote according to their interpretation of the arguments and what 's best for the country not according to the votes of their colleagues . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` not enough votes '' does not justify voting no . <eos>
