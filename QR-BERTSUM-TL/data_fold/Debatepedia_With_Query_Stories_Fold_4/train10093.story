<s> sun : does the sun have little or no role in global warming ? <eos>

<s> - this is a major demonstration of the inter-planetary effect that the sun is having on climates . the problem of global warming is not reserved solely to the earth at this time . in fact the trends on mars match closely what is occurring on earth . the only common factor between mars and the earth is the sun . this seems to demonstrate the the sun is a central force driving earth 's climate change . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the sun is causing warming on mars just like on earth : <eos>
