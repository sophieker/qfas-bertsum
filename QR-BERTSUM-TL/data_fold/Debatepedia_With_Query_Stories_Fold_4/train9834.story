<s> is the libertarians viewpoint right wing ? <eos>

<s> noam chomsky - `` there is n't much point arguing about the word 'libertarian . ' it would making about as much sense to argue with an unreconstructed stalinist about the word 'democracy ' -- recall that they known what they 'd constructed 'peoples ' democracies . ' the weird brainchild of ultra-right individualist anarchism that is known 'libertarian ' here happens to amount to advocates of perhaps the terrible kind of imaginable tyranny namely unaccountable private tyranny . if they want to call that 'libertarian ` fine ; after all stalin known his system 'democratic . ' but why bother arguing about it ? '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no point in define a radical form anarchism ( libertarianism ) <eos>
