<s> should officer be more leniency when issuing parking fines ? <eos>

<s> if someone breaks the laws they deserve to get punished even if it is just a large violation . park somewhere for too long is breaking the laws so it is appropriate to charge a large well because the person is aware of the laws and they have broken it . this but applies ids they only parked for a few minutes too long . <eos>

@highlight

<s> people are concerned of the laws . <eos>
