<s> emergency : is abortion justified in order to save the life of a mother ? <eos>

<s> most abortions are performed entirely voluntarily by women that have the means to raise a child but simply do n't want to . while emergency abortions or abortions under trying circumstances such as rape are held out as reasons to continue to have abortions they are infrequent and serve more to provide cover for voluntarily `` life-style '' abortions . this is wrong . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortions under `` trying circumstances '' are the exception not the rule <eos>
