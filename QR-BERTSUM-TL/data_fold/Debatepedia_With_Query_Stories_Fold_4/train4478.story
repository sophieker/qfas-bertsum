<s> transparency : are earmark adequately transparent ? <eos>

<s> david minge former member of the u.s. house of representatives . `` the cases against academic earmarking '' - `` earmarks are worse because they are obscure and do not face competitive reviews unless in the back-room politics of the appropriations transit or other committees that engage in the process . earmarks lack peer reviews and the scrutiny of public hearings . they are not included in the administration s budget . often they originate in only one chamber . thus earmarks move below the radar .
