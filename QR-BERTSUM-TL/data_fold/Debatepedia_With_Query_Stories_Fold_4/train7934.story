<s> church and state : does the monarchy violate separation of church and state ? <eos>

<s> the constitution calls for `` neutrality '' between state institutions and religion . this means that the church can have a prominent position in public life so long as the state is neutral . many argue this is better than having a `` separation of church and state '' because it better enables the state to fund religious practices as long as it does so neutrally . if this system is better what is the problem with the monarchy ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> the principal of `` neutrality '' between church and state is justified . <eos>
