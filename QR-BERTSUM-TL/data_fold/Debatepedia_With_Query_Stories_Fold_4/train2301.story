<s> security : is nato vital for the world 's security ? <eos>

<s> russia can no longer offer the conventional military threat of the cold war . the acceptance of this reality by the us is evidenced by the fact that there are no longer 300 000 troops stationed in germany . the indebted and demoralised russian infantry is presently overstretched in the persistent conflicts in chechnya and tajikistan . the combination of the weakness of russia s conventional forces and the antagonism that would be created by the deployment of nato troops on its borders in the new republics would be dangerously counter-productive . russia would be obliged more than ever to depend on her nuclear arsenal . therefore expansion is not only unnecessary but it is also likely to increase the threat of nuclear conflict in <eos>

@highlight

<s> nato is an outdated alliance against a long gone soviet threat <eos>
