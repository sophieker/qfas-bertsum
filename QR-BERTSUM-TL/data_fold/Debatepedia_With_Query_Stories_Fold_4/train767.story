<s> . since the implementation of resolution # the british government has always maintained it would only transfer sovereignty if the population requested it . spain recognised britains rights to the island in # allowing the british to physically leave the islands . this agreement can only be cancelled mutually . physical abandonment does not mean politcal abandonment . argentina claims the island are theirs despite the fact everybody with bsas authority orders to do so set one foot on the island until # ( # years after independence and # after taking control of bsas ) <eos>
