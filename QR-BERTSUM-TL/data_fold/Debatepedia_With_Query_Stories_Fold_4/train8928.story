<s> waterboarding : is waterboarding a legitimate form of interrogation ? <eos>

<s> - torture is defined by many groups as a only techniques that leaves lasting physical damage and scars on the person being tortured . this is not the case with waterboarding which causes no permanent damage to the lungs and does not have a track record of causing lasting mental trauma to those that perform the techniques . if this was the case the united states military would not perform waterboarding on its own soldiers for training purposes . while international organizations would take issue with a definition of torture that only includes physical damage it would be a mistake to overlook the rational behind this definition . <eos>

@highlight

<s> waterboarding leaves no lasting scars and so is not torture <eos>
