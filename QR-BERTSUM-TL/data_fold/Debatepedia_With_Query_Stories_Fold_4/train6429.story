<s> enforcement : could a cell phones bans be enforceable ? <eos>

<s> improving camera technology may also allow the automatic detection of drivers breaking laws against phones phone use at the wheel . in any cases just because a laws is not completely enforceable it does not take that it should be scrapped . <eos>

@highlight

<s> new laws would be enforceable as billing records will shows if a phone was in use at the time . <eos>
