<s> students : do teacher strikes have benefit on the students ? <eos>

<s> most of the time when teachers strike it is because students needs have not been met . when teachers strike the government usually does n't like it because everybody is teaching the children so they listen to the teachers to avoid it happenning again . teachers are the only trained education professionals in society and as such it is vitally important for students and the community that they have at least some inputs into how education systems are run . if governments create policies or enact legislation without consulting the very people who run the schools on a daily terms then a strike becomes the only ways in which these invaluable voices can contribute to the development of educational reforms . in an ideal world <eos>
