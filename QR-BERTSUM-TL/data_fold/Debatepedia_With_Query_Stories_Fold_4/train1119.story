<s> abstinence message : is the abstinence-only messages appropriate ? <eos>

<s> individuals should not deny their natural sexual impulses . if an individual has a strong desire to have sex they should probably pursuing that desire albeit responsibly . teaching teens that sex is wrong forces them to believe that their natural sexual impulses are wrong - causing great misunderstanding and self-doubt - and causing the needless and frustrating suppression of sexual impulses . instead teens should be taught that these impulses are natural and beautiful and should be helped in the process of understanding and channeling these impulses . this will help teens live a more fulfilling lives opposed to a lives of self-denial . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abstinence-only wrongly teach suppression of sexuality impulses . <eos>
