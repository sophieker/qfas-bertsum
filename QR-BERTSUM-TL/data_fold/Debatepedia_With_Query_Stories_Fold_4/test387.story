<s> self-determination : do the islanders have a right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> in 1833 spain had not relinquished her own claim to the falklands in fact she did not begin to relinquish any of her territories in the americas till 1836 did not recognise argentina till 1859 and when she recognised argentina no transfer or cession of sovereignty over the falklands took place so it was spain 's prerogative to complain about what britain did in 1833 not argentina 's . and spain never did . <eos>
