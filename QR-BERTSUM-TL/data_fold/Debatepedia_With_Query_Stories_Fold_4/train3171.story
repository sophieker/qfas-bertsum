<s> argumentation overview : <eos>

<s> an importance strategic choice the affirmative must make is whether to arguing against the practice of plead bargaining as whole or just plead bargaining in exchange for testimony . affirmative could try to arguing second that plead bargaining is in general unjust but then contend that even if this were n't true that plead bargaining in exchange of testify is unjust . adopting a two tiered `` even if '' approach to affirming is always fairly risky since the dangers is the appearance that the affirmative is contradictory . further the negative could always concede that plead bargaining in general is wrong but that when its necessary to elicit testify it is just . <eos>
