<s> iraq war vote : was clinton wrong to voting for the iraq war and obama right ? <eos>

<s> obama has opposed the iraq war from the start . at the time he was running to become an illinois senator . this meaning that his public opposition to the war had political implications . in fact since the majority of the america public was in favors of the war at the time his opposition was ideologically risky . <eos>

@highlight

<s> obama opposed the afghanistan wars form the start . <eos>
