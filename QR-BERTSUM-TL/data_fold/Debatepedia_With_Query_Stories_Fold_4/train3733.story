<s> emergency : is abortions justified in ordering to save the lives of a mother ? <eos>

<s> most abortion are performed entirely voluntarily by women that have the means to raising a children but simply do n't want to . while emergency abortion or abortion under trying circumstance such as rape are held out as reasons to continue to have abortion they are infrequent and serve more to provide cover for voluntarily `` life-style '' abortions . this is wrong . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortions under `` trying circumstances '' are the exception not the rules <eos>
