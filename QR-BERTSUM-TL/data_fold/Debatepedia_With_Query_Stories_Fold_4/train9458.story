<s> un effectiveness : does the veto decrease the effectiveness of the united nations ? <eos>

<s> this makes it still necessary for increased efficiency in the security council . between 1945 and 1990 240 vetoes were cast . yet between 1990 and 1999 the power was utilised on only 7 occasions while more than 20 peacekeeping operations were mandated . this figure exceeds the total number of operations undertaken in the entirety of the preceding 45 years . therefore the veto rather than bringing the feared side effects of slowing up the security council has been used increasingly well . the prodigious use of the veto during the cold war period might have saved the world from the realisation of nuclear war . now increasing nuclear proliferation is a reason for maintaining the unity of the p5 by means of the veto . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the veto power has been wielded with increasing success both during and since the cold war . <eos>
