<s> reform : is reforming the filibuster possible or is getting eliminate of it needed ? <eos>

<s> there are those possible reforms of the filibuster that address those of the concerns raised by opponent to it . putting the onus on the filibusters party to be present during a filibuster instead of the majority party is one proposal reform . lowered the number of the number of a `` filibuster-proof '' majority from # to # or so is another proposal method . collectively such reforms are perhaps a better way of eliminating any negative elements of the filibuster while avoiding the difficult process of amending the constitution to get rid of it . and this suggests that abandoning the filibuster is an excessive measure . reforming it is sufficient . <eos>

@highlight

<s> eliminating filibuster is excessive ; reform are sufficient . <eos>
