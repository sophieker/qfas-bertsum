<s> stability country : can afghanistan be made into a stability country/democracy ? <eos>

<s> while the us and nato would try to focus on nation-building and democracy state-building in afghanistan this is too lofty a goal and unnecessary . the initial post- # / # goal was to getting rid of the taliban and prevent afg from continuing as a safe haven for terrorists . this goal remains legitimately and any smaller nation-building goals should be seen as non-essential . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us need not likelihood in afg but counters terrorist <eos>
