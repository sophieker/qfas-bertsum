<s> social : are the social and humans impacts of the dam positive ? <eos>

<s> investments in tgd and the costs of its construction were so large that it is likely to be closed in the potential but if it becomes clear that the environmental and social costs were higher than expected . a return on investment must be achieved in such a project and this create a the potential for a high level of rigidity against social and environmental concerns . <eos>

@highlight

<s> closing tgd due to potential problems is unlikely given its sizes <eos>
