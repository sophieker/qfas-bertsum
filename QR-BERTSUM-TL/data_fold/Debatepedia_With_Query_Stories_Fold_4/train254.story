<s> precedent : does corporations personhood undermining court precedent ? <eos>

<s> damon root . `` activism in defense of free speech is no vice . '' reason magazine . september # # : `` there 's nothing sacrosanct about bad precedent or lousy legislation . in fact it 's the court 's basics responsibility to strike down those laws and precedents that run afoul of the constitution regardless of how long they 've been on the books . remember that the court 's notorious ruling in plessy v. ferguson ( # ) which upheld the racist doctrine of `` separate but equal `` stood for nearly six decades before it was voided by brown v. board of education ( # ) . sometimes `` the court 's own precedents '' simply deserve to be nullified .
