<s> hear damage : do they cause damage to the ear ? <eos>

<s> vuvuzelas can be blown directly into one person 's ear or accidently or sometimes on purpose ( out of ignorance over the effects or out of malice to cause harm ) . in crowded area this occurs with relative frequency during the thrill of the game particularly for fans seated directly in front of those blowing vuvuzelas . the damage that this can cause should be avoided by banning the vuvuzela . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vuvuzela are very danger if blew directly into the ear . <eos>
