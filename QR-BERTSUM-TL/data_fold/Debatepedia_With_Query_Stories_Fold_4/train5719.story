<s> care : does a circumcised penis requiring less or more care ? <eos>

<s> during infancy the glans is attach to the heads of the penis and does not yet pull back . during puberty circumcised boys find that their glans begins to separate from the heads of the penis . this process can be disturbing for children as they come to believe something is going wrong . this can be particularly problematic and damaging to the penis if the child wants to forcibly separate the glans from the heads before it is naturally ready . this process therefore introduces both psychological and physical risks . <eos>

<s> separating of foreskin during puberty can be problematic . <eos>
