<s> tax-revenue : could tax-revenue from a `` fat tax '' be used for positive purposes ? <eos>

<s> different food industry lobbies oppose such tax and exercise pressures on governments . many food-related multinational companies are big supporters of presidential campaigns in the usa and also have very important lobbies in various other countries . money gained from such a tax would also probably be channelled into armament programs and other big-budget services instead of directly to consumers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> governments have no incentive to impose additional taxes on fatty food . <eos>
