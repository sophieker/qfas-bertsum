<s> theory : is democratic instrumental to peace or do geopolitics play a smaller role ? <eos>

<s> `` freedom democracy peace ; power democide and war '' . hawaii.edu -- `` it is true that democratic freedom is an engine of national and individuals wealth and prosperity . hardly known however is that freedom also saves billions of lives from famines disease war collective violence and democide ( genocide and mass murder ) . that is the more freedom the greater the human security and the less the violence . conversely the more power governments have the more human insecurity and violence . in short : to our realization that power impoverishes we must also add that power kills .

<s> powers kills ; absolute powers kills absolutely <eos>
