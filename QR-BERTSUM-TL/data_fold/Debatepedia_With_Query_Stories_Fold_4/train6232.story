<s> war on terror : is it wrong to think the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> the proportion of the fighters in iraq that are driven by a jihadist/terrorists cause is very small . most are fighting to expel the united states to fight other religious sects or simply to earn money . therefore while a withdrawal might embolden jihadists they are so insignificant in iraq that the effect would be negligible on iraq and us and coalition security interests . <eos>

<s> a us withdrawal might embolden jihadists but they are insignificant in iraq <eos>
