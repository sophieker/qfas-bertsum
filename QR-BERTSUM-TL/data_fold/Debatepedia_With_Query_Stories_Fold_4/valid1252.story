<s> vs. private insurance : are co-ops a good alternative to private insurance ? <eos>

<s> in reflecting on reforming the united states health care system it is importance to look abroad for examples . interationally there are virtually no example of successful national systems based on co-ops . public health insurance conversely has been very successful world wide and is a part of virtually each industrialized nations ' health care systems -- almost all of which rank above the united states in world health organizations rankings ( the united states ranked # th [ last among industrialized nations ] in these rankings ) . based on these proven example it would be wise to implementing a public insurance plan not a co-op system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> private insurance has succeeded globally co-ops have not . <eos>
