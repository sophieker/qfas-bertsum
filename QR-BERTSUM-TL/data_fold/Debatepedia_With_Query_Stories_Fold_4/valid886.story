<s> pro-life : is the pro-life anti-abortionist consistent in support executions ? <eos>

<s> richard r. eddlem . `` ten anti-death penalty fallacies '' . the new american . june # # - `` a related fallacy is that the pro-lifer who defends the right to life of an unborn baby in the mother 's womb but who does not defend the right to life of a sentenced murderer on death second is being morally inconsistent . but there is no inconsistency here : the unborn baby is innocent ; the sentenced murderer is not . it is the ppm penalty liberal who is morally inconsistent since he supports putting to death only the innocent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the executed guilty can not be equating with abort unborn innocent <eos>
