<s> bribe ? -- is plea bargaining for testimony different to bribery ? <eos>

<s> offering plea bargain for a testimony is different to entrapment which is illegal : in entrapment a police officers may withhold capturing and subsequently punishing a criminal in exchange for concessions from that criminal usually in the form of money . this is widely considered corrupted and illegal . in asking for a testimony from a criminal in exchange for a plea bargain and reduced sentence a different really is happening ; authorities are withholding punishments ( even if only partially ) in exchange for a concessions from a criminal ( an incriminating testimony ) . the similarities here are strong enough to ask why one is illegal and the other common practice ? <eos>
