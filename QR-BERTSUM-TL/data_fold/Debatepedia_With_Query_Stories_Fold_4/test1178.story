<s> vs private insurance : are cooperatives a good alternative to private insurance ? <eos>

<s> while it is entirely true that co-ops are a great option and should be encouraged they are not a substitute for a regional insurance plan . this has a lot to do with the fact that co-ops simply can not scale as well as public insurance to solve the problem of millions of uninsured americans . as house speaker nancy pelosi ( d-calif. ) says in august of # `` if somebody thinks a co-op can work for their state let them go and do it . [ but they are no substitute for public insurance ] . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> nonprofit co-ops are great but no substitute for private insurances <eos>
