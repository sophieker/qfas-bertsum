<s> does evolutionary allow rooms for god ? <eos>

<s> gods is all powerful . why would he need to create something imperfect and allow nature to take its course ? even if gods directed all the processes of evolution to create the creatures that he wanted it begs one big question : why did n't he create a perfect creature to start off with and saving time ? the theories of macro-evolution if accepted by believers always causes massive theological complications and awkwardnesses like this . <eos>

@highlight

<s> evolution enables little rooms for god . <eos>
