<s> homosexuality analogy : is legalizing incest analogous to legalizing homosexuality ? <eos>

<s> homosexuality is typically a relationship between equal parties . incest contrarily is much more prone to abusive relations between older and younger siblings father and daughter or son and mother before these individuals could be considered `` consenting adults '' . it is this inherent prospect of abuse that makes incest different than homosexuality and compels the state to intervene . <eos>

@highlight

<s> incestuous relationships are more prone to abuse than homosexual ones . <eos>
