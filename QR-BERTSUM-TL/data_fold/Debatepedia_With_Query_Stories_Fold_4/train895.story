<s> genetics modifications : is the genetics modification of animals appropriate ? <eos>

<s> there are indeed new issues raised by the advent of genetics engineering and 'transgenic ' animals ; these like all animal experiments should be strongly monitoring so as to minimize animal suffering . the fact that there are new issues here does not mean that there should never be any experiments on animals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the genetic modifications of animals want only be but regulated . <eos>
