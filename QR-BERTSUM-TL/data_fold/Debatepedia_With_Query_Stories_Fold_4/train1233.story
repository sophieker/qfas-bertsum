'' american thinker . april 6 2010 : `` painful as it is a free-market capitalist economy is going to ebb and flow . but big government has aggravated the severity of our current financial meltdown as well as contributed to the stymied recovery -- similar to what happened in the new deal of the 1930s . this administration is following suit and their financial reform legislation will stymie or derail a robust recovery . '' <eos>
