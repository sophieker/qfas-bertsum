<s> torture : are enhanced interrogation techniques legal or are they torture ? <eos>

<s> asked about president george bush 's comments in october 10 2007 that `` this government does not torture people '' former president jimmy carter said `` that 's not an accurate statement if you use the international norms of torture as has always been honored -- certainly in the last 60 years since the universal declaration of human rights was promulgated . but you can make your own definition of human rights and say we do n't violate them and you can make your own definition of torture and say we do n't violate them . '' [ 24 ] <eos>

@highlight
