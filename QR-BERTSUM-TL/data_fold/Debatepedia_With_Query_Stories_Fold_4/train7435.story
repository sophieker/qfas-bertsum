<s> symbol ? is the hijab an repressive anti-democratic symbol ? <eos>

<s> the core principle of headscarves is that it protects the modesty and dignity of the woman . this is a nearly universal interpretation of the act . this is an offensive premise . it considers that the physical features of women are inherently offensive in appearance and that men are incapable of containing their sexual impulses forth seeing a woman 's natural form . it holds that the only way a woman can be dignified and accepted in society is if she conceals her true identity and form . these are offensive and undemocratic principles and do not belong in a modern democracy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the idea that women must wearing headscarves to be respectful is offensive <eos>
