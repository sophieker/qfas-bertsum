<s> security : would a missile defense system increse european security ? <eos>

<s> peter brookes . `` the case for european missile defense '' . heritage . march # # - `` despite the range of concerns about missile defense it should be emphasized that missile defense is a defensive not offensive weapon . indeed the dominant design of the missile defense interceptor warhead does not even contain an explosive charge ; traveling at # # miles per hour it destroying the missile warhead by the sheer force of the collision . therefore the idea that missile defense is an offensive system as many have suggest is patently false . in a way missile defense is like an umbrella ; it is only need if it rains . '' <eos>
