<s> deterrence : are prosecutions importance for deterring future war crimes ? <eos>

<s> it is doubtful whether atrocities such as this is based on rational calculations ; the diversion of resources into the final solution was a major reason why hitler lost the war . in the same way wars murderers are unlikely to be dissuade by law threats such as these ; they are driven by a fanatical hatred not common sense . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those that commit war crimes are often irrational and would be deterred by visible prosecutions : <eos>
