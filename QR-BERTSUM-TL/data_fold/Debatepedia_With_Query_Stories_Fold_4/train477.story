<s> if there is still vat on the product the government is still earning money . similarly reducing the amounts to the `` zero-rate '' shows the electorate that they want to take firm actions against it and are willing to incur opportunity costs . furthermore it is the easiest methods to implement and in the benefit of the pharmacy owner etc who seeing it as in their most interests to keep up to date with a reduction in vat as they earn more money . <eos>
