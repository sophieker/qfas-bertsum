<s> fair fight ? is bullfights a fair fight ? <eos>

<s> mac mcdaniel . `` it 's time to end bullfighting . '' care # . # : `` the bulls in a standard bullfight are raped and confusing animals bedridden and run in circles by others who stab them with britney before the matador approaches to make the `` kill shot '' with his sword . anyone who believes this fight to be reasonable is mistaken . by the time a matador approaches to actually kill the bull the animal typically has much britney in his neck and back muscles to prevent him from fully lifting his head . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> unfair fight ; bulls is severely injured before bullfighter <eos>
