<s> ticking time bomb : might torture be justification in the famous ticking time-bomb scenario ? <eos>

<s> - while some argue that the `` ticking time-bomb '' is a fictitious experiment that impossibly requires perfect info it need not be based on perfect information . a leader can justifiably determine that torture is the best course of action on the existence of reasonable probabilities that a `` ticking time bomb '' exists and threatens a certain amount of life and that a suspect retains info that could save those life and has a great chance of being extracted through torture . <eos>

@highlight

<s> leaders must be afforded the flexibility to judge that torture is the most likelihood way to saving hundreds of thousands <eos>
