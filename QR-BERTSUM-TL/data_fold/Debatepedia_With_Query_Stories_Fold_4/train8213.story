<s> voters : do voters seek divided government ? <eos>

<s> michael kinsley . `` mccain 's last mistake . undivided government wo n't be as bad as he warned it would be . '' slate . 4 nov. 2008 - `` almost no one actually chooses divided government . almost everyone who votes for obama also votes democratic for the senate and the house . ditto mccain and the republicans . divided government results when those totals are close and just a few ticket-splitters can produce a divided result . mccain was not asking voters to split their tickets . he was urging republicans tempted to vote for obama not to split their tickets for fear that undivided government would be the result .
