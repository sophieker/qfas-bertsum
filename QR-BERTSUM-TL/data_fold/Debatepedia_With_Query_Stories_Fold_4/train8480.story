<s> middle east : is a nuclear iran intolerable to middle east security ? <eos>

<s> dr. barry posen writes in a february # # article in the new york times : `` because many of iran 's neighbors lack nuclear weapons it 's possible that iran could use a nuclear capacity to blackmail such states into meeting demands - for example to raise oil prices cut oil production or withhold cooperation with the united states . but many of iran 's neighbors are allies of the united states which holds a strategic stake in their autonomy and is unlikely to sit by idly as iran blackmails say kuwait or saudi arabia . it is unlikely that these states would capitulate to a nuclear iran rather than rely on an american deterrent threat . to give in to iran once would leave them open <eos>
