<s> does rehab probably work ? <eos>

<s> if we could find a medicine that would cure some offenders so they would never offend again would we really not want it ? even if it only working for some people is that not still worthwhile ? it is no different with rehabilitative programs we should certainly support them if they can be shown to work . and indeed the most recent studies show that they do . such programs include cognitive-behavioral programs ( say trying to get a violent offender to think and react differently to potential trigger situations ) pro-social modeling programs and some child-abuse treatment programs . the most credible studies ( done by a technique known meta-analysis ) demonstrating that the net effect of treatment is on average a positive reduction of overall recidivism <eos>

@highlight

<s> study show rehab programs are effective . <eos>
