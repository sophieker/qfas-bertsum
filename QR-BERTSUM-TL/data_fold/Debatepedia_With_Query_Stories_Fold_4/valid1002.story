<s> war on terror ? is waterboarding valuable to the war on terror ? <eos>

<s> - it is claimed that waterboarding obtained a `` gold mine '' of information from # / # mastermind khalid sheik mohammed . but without public knowledge of the exact information it is not clear that this is the case . in addition it is likely that mohammed calculated to provide information that was not central to al qaeda 's various missions but that would be seen by his interrogators as a `` gold mine '' . <eos>
