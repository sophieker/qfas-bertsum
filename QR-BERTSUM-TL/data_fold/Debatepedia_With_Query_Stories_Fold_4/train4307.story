<s> changing behavior : would an aviation taxes provide an incentives to make airplanes engines more efficient ? <eos>

<s> as the popularity of air travel continues to increased rapidly it is important to put pressure on the aviation industry to use fuel as efficiently as possible so as to hold emissions down as much as possible . with fossil fuel reserves running out fuel biodiversity is which a wise use of finite resources . more expensive fuel would give airlines an incentives to adopt the most modern technology and update their fleets . they could which adopt flying practices aimed at maximising fuel efficiency - e.g . flying at lower speeds even but journey times would be longer .
