<s> symbolism : what are the cons and pros of republican and monarchy symbols in aus . ? <eos>

<s> some say that the monarchy only has symbolic meaning as a ways to expressly the significance of the monarchy and thus reduce the significance of the complaints raising against it . but even if the monarchy had only a symbolic significance ( which it does not - it engenders real power ) its symbolic importance is both small and largely bad . the historic commonwealth inherited sexist and even religiously discriminatory symbols associated with the crowned are all significant and significantly bad . they can not be diminishing in significance only disowned . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the symbolism of the australian monarchies is importance and bad <eos>
