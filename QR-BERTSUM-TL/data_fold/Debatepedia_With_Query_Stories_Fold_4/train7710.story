<s> elephant populations : have elephant population revived as a result of the bans and is this a fact to relax or <eos>

<s> although elephant populations in southern african are viable and increasing this is not the case elsewhere in african nor is it true of the wild asian elephant populations of south asia . no test can reveal where worked ivory originated nor which species it was from so lifting the trading bans would making it easy for poachers everywhere to sell ivory increasing their profits and their motivation to killing more elephants . the corruption widespread in african and repair of asia would making it easy for poachers to mask the illegal origins of their ivory passing it off as legitimate .

@highlight

<s> increases in elephant populations are only occurring in some places making the un bans on ivory trading still relevant : <eos>
