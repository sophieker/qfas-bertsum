<s> rating/voting system - would it be beneficial ? <eos>

<s> if we prevent random users from rating arguments not only do we make the system less attractive for random visitors but we also create an `` artificial elite '' - an elite of sysops ( or whoever else would be eligible to vote ) who could easily rate their own arguments as `` good '' and arguments of non-privileged users as `` useless '' . there is no software that could prevent that . <eos>
