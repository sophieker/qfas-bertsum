<s> voluntary action : is voluntary individual climate aid insufficient ? <eos>

<s> no country owes any other country aid . in the case of climate change the lack of knowledge about greenhouse gases waves any requirement . countries can instead choose to donate aid to poor countries on a voluntary basis . because the resolution seems to call for all un annex i countries to increase aid it appears to call for a categorical responsibility or even requirement on the part of developed countries . this violates the basic principles of charitable donorship and aid : that it be voluntary . <eos>

@highlight

<s> countries should increase climate aid on a voluntary basis . <eos>
