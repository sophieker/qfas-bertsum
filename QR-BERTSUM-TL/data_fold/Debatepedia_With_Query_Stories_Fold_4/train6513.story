<s> cultural standards : does assimilation set a false moral-cultural standard ? <eos>

<s> some cultures should not be accepted due to their beliefs . one can argue that cultures are not equal and thus do not earn equal rights in society . for example barbaric cultures that believe that `` honour killings '' and female circumcision are justifiable should not be given the same rights as those cultures which are very similar to the laws of that nation . sharia law has many questionable and quite frankly prehistoric beliefs that we should not be eager to accept . the mixing of cultures ultimately picks up both the good and bad points and society would in fact be worse off with this culture . thus social cohesion would be hindered . <eos>

@highlight

<s> some cultures do n't warrant protection under multiculturalism <eos>
