<s> govt vs. markets : does govt have a legitimate place here ? <eos>

<s> art carden . `` life liberty and the pursuit of fatty foods . '' forbes . march 4th 2010 : `` there is also no such thing as a free 'trans-fat-free ' lunch . restricting trans fat consumption requires resources . police officers could instead use these resources to enforce laws against crimes like theft property damage rape and murder and educators could use these resources in the classroom . are educators using their time and resources wisely preventing illegal bake sales and making sure school fundraisers and functions sell only stuff that 's on the 'approved ' list ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> resources for regulating trans fats take from other things . <eos>
