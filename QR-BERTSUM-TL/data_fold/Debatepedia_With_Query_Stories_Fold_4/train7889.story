<s> broader philosophies : what are the opposing philosophies of each system ? <eos>

<s> socialism presents a `` mob rule '' where the collective ( or whomever controls the government ) outweighs any decisions made by individuals concerning their own lives . individual `` needs '' are dictated by the state and so niche markets are prevented from forming . this causes a lack of innovation and social progress because major trends and even fundamental changes in society and technology start in niche markets with very specific needs that would not be considered `` efficient '' for the state to provide . <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism allows for greater personal fulfillment . <eos>
