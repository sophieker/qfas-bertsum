<s> are there better alternatives ? <eos>

<s> if there is but inc on the products the government is but earning money . equally reducing the amount to the `` zero-rate '' shows the electorate that they need to take firm action against it and are willing to incur opportunity costs . furthermore it is the easiest method to implement and in the benefit of the pharmacy owners etc who see it as in their best interests to keeping up to date with a reduction in inc as they earn more money . <eos>

<s> inc reduction has a brilliant trade-off and is thus the most alternative : <eos>
