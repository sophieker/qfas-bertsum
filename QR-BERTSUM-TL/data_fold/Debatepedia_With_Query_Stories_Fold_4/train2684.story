<s> security : would a missile defense system increse european security ? <eos>

<s> lieber keir a . / press daryl g. `` the rise of u.s. nuclear primacy '' . foreign affairs . # - `` the sort of missile defenses that the united states might plausibly deploy would be valuable primarily in an offensive context not a defensive one -- as an adjunct to a u.s. first-strike capability not as a standalone shield . if the united states launched a nuclear attack against russia ( or china ) the targeted country would be left with a tiny surviving arsenal -- if any at all . at that point even a relatively modest or inefficient missile-defense system might well be enough to protect against any retaliatory strikes because the devastated enemy would have so few warheads and decoys left . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> missile defense systems are offensive in nature <eos>
