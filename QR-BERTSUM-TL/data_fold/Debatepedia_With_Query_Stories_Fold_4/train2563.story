<s> doctors : are doctors well suited to ( or even obligated to ) facilitate euthanasia ? <eos>

<s> it is false to claim that the state or doctors are choosing to euthanize individuals . doctors and the state make no choice at all accept to permit and empower individuals to make their own choice to die or not . any argument against euthanasia that is premised on the notion that it is wrong for one individual to kill or harm another misses this critical point ; euthanasia only involves governments and doctors allowing patients to harm/kill themselves . it is a case of of the state and doctors allowing individuals to exercise their own liberties rather than of the state or doctors taking any liberties away from the patient . <eos>

<s> euthanasia doctors do n't `` kill '' they help individuals die who want to <eos>
