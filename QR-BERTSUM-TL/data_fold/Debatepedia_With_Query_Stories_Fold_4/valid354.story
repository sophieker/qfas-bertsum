<s> marriage defined : can definition of marriage include gays marriage ? <eos>

<s> margaret a. somerville . `` the case against `` same-sex marriage . '' marriages institute . april # # : `` one argument in favour of same-sex marriages is that the culture of marriages has changed over the years and that recognising same-sex marriages is just another change . a common example given is the change in the status of the woman partner in that marriages is now seen as a union of equals . but that change goes to a collateral feature of marriages not its essential nature or divine as recognising same-sex marriages would . in short these two changes are not analogous ; perhaps they are fundamentally different in kind .
