<s> defense : is military recruit important to regional security ? <eos>

<s> an all volunteer military must recruit to keep up its numbers . the army navy and air force need well-educated and motivated recruits so that they can defend our country from its enemies . visits to schools are not about forcing militaristic propaganda on children but about making sure that # - # year year-olds know about the military as a possible career choice . after all college representatives and locally employer are allowed to make presentations to student so it would be unfair to keep just the military out . if you accept that we need armed forces then you must allow them to recruit openly . <eos>

@highlight

<s> recruiters are required element of all-volunteer forces <eos>
