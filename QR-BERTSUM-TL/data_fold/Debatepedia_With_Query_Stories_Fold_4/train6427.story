<s> surrender : was bombing japan required in getting them to surrender ? <eos>

<s> professor of history robert james maddox . -- `` another myth that has attained wide attention is that at least several of truman s top civilian advisers later inform him that using atomic bombs against japan would be militarily unnecessary or immoral or both . there is no persuasive evidence that any of them did so . none of the joint chiefs ever made such a claim however one inventive author has tried to make it appearing that leahy did by braiding together several unrelated passages from the admirals s memoirs . probably two days after hiroshima truman told aides that leahy had 'said up to the last that it wouldn t go off .
