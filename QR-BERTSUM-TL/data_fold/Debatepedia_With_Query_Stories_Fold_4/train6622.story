<s> players : is playoffs in interest of player health/academics ? <eos>

<s> in other sport the toll of each games on the athlete 's bodies is much larger than it is in football . for that reason a college football playoff presents risks to the players ' health . this is especially true when considering that a playoff might be pact into a relatively short period of time . the championship games therefore be be between two injury-ridden teams . this sort of a risky unhealthy playoffs should not be forced on our student-athlete football players . <eos>

<s> playoffs are harder on soccer players ' bodies <eos>
