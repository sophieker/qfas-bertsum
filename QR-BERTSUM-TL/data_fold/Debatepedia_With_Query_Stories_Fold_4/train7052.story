<s> if science gives microorganisms `` living status '' should n't at least the same status apply to a ( n ) embryo/fetus ? <eos>

<s> . all organisms in the scientific `` kingdoms '' of monera protista fungi plantae and animalia are considered alive by science when their cells are functioning replicating having the chemical processes etc even one-celled organisms `` protists '' are considered alive and to an even greate extent bacteria and viruses which are n't even another sustainable cell but microscopic parasites are still considered alive . with all classifications of life being granted to cells and even pseudo-cells that have chemical processes occurring within them energy being used and reproduction of the cell happening : why are n't multi-celled human embryos and fetuses being considered `` alive '' ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is general knowledge that all science says that bacteria virus organisms fungi are lives <eos>
