<s> us resources/priorities : is the us able and wanting to prioritize military intervention ? <eos>

<s> why favor one over the other ? since the united states is already military strained in iraq it is in-fact that any commitment in darfur would result in some weakening of resources for iraq . but many sources consider the weakening of resources in iraq or any withdrawal of troops to be a recipe for internecine violent and genocide in iraq . why should we trading one for another ? are iraqis not equally deserving of protect from genocide as sudanese ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> preventing genocide in sudan with us troops would take them away from preventing genocide in iraq . <eos>
