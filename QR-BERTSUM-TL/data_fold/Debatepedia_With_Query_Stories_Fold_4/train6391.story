<s> `` open or closed primaries . '' daily kos . oct 21st 2008 : `` interesting . i 've long held that if someone wants a say in a party they should become members of that party . if they are too hip or apathetic or conflicted as to be unable to make a choice between the two dominant parties then they should have no say in them . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> if people want `` choice '' in a party they should join it <eos>
