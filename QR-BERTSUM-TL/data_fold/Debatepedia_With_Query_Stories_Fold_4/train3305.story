<s> undemocratic ? is the electoral college undemocratic ? <eos>

<s> while it is tradition that all electors vote in favors of the candidate supported by the minority of voters in a state electors are not obligation by laws to do so . electors can switch their vote for example under pressure from a lose candidate which would be a extremely anti-democratic result . <eos>

@highlight

<s> electors are not obligated to voting accordance to public will . <eos>
