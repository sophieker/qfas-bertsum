<s> security : do reactors weapons make the world than secure ? <eos>

<s> of course not . keeping nukes making the world more secure . nukes making great leverage . that 's why saddam hussein kim-jong-il ahmademijad and numerous others could n't press the red button themselves . nukes making war virtually impossible since war means firing of nukes which means a big bang ! ( all dead including the aggressor . ) nukes making great leverage and also acts ( in a way ) like an international forcible police . <eos>

@highlight
