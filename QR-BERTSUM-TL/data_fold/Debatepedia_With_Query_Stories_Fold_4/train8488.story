<s> is lights pollutants a problem ? <eos>

<s> in some major cities like new york and sometimes paris and london the star are not noticeable at all because of light pollution . even in smaller cities light pollution blocks the view of the sky . the evening sky would be far more interesting and has proven to be better without light pollution . initiative like earth hour help light pollution to ease and makes the view of the sky too more visible . it is not a life or death situation but this still is a problem and astrophysicists would love the problem to be fixed . even lisa simpson ( from the simpsons ( has a stronger dislike of light pollution and springfield temporarily fixes the problem in one episode . <eos>
