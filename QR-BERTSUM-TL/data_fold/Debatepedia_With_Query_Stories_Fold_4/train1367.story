<s> george tenet wrote in his # book `` at the center of the storm '' ( pp # - # ) : `` the most aggressively interrogation techniques conducted by cia personnel were applied to only a handful of the worst terrorists on the planet include people who had planned the # / # attacks and who among other thing were responsibility for journalist daniel pearl s death . the interrogation of these few individuals was conducted in a precisely monitored measured way specifically to try to prevent what we claimed to be an imminent follow-up attack . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> aggressively enhanced interrogation techniques were rarely used . <eos>
