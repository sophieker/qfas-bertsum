<s> national identity : do the roma have a strong cultural and national identity fitting for independence ? <eos>

<s> only # million at most speak any kind of romany [ # ] . nazi persecution coupled with damaging communist paternalism that encouraged gypsies to settle down has eroded much of traditional romany culture . many roma are orthodox christian or catholic and few remain truly nomadic . three quarters of england s roma population have permanent addresses for instance . all that the roma have in common is the prejudice of others and this is not the sound basis of a nation .
