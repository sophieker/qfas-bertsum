<s> sterilization : is sterilization of kangaroos an inadequate alternative ? <eos>

<s> professor professor gordon grigg - university of queensland . `` kangaroos on defence lands - another view '' . march # th # - `` sterilisation has also been suggested and that is worth considering proactively when a populations is small in order to head off the problem before it arises . sterilisation is a waste of time once the populations is small enough to be causing land degradation because the sterilised individuals will still be there continuing to feed for years to come . possibly some selectively sterilisation would be worth considering in canberra after the culling has reduced the numbers sufficiently . '' without culling sterilization is ineffective to help preventing the problem kangaroos pose in australia . <eos>

<s> sterilisation is not an effectiveness response to kangaroo over-population <eos>
