<s> environment : is vegetarianism great for the environment ? <eos>

<s> farming animals is hugely wasteful in lands plants crops requiring a small part of the space to producing the same amount of calories as livestock . so if every human ate a vegetarian diet there would be no need to chop down the rainforest and ruin the land . nor would our seas be emptied of fish and other species like dolphins and corals which harmed by the methods used to catch them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> vegetarians generally helps the environments <eos>
