<s> needy : is free health care important for those in dire need ? <eos>

<s> indigent patients have been taken care of by physicians with dignity and compassion in the name of genuine charity pro bono . this model can provide adequate care to the needy . and of course this model can be expanded out further if need be to aid the needy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a right to health care is not necessary in taking care of sick patients . <eos>
