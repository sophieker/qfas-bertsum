<s> contract : was citigroup obligated by contracts to give bonuses ? <eos>

<s> aig would not have surviving without taxpayer bailout so they would have entered paragraph # bankruptcy and the aig contract would have been voided . for them to arguing that these contract are inviolate after the bailout is ludicrous . <eos>

@highlight

<s> aig bonuses would not have been possible no bail-out <eos>
