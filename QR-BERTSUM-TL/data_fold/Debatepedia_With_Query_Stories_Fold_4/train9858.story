<s> rape : should instance of impregnated through rape justify abortion ? <eos>

<s> the child has a right to life just as much as that woman had the right to not be raped . her rights were violated by the rapist . aborting the child would be violating the child 's right to life . i certainly feeling deeply for anyone in such a position but that does n't mean i would sympathize with them enough to believe they have the right to then cause harm to another . a woman 's body is required to produce life therefore an fetus child has no other option then to rely on her no matter the reason for conception . the murderer made a choice based on his own selfish feelings and beliefs in what he was titled to is n't that exactly what <eos>

@highlight

<s> having an abortion is just as wrong as the rape either . <eos>
