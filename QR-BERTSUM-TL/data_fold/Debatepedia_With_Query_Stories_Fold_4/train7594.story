<s> nature : are zoos unnatural and initially immoral ? <eos>

<s> many zoo do not lock animals up in cages . a lot of them have large area that animals can play in and a lot is done to ensuring the animals are happy . the animals ' housings are made to be different to the animals ' natural habitats and care is taken to ensuring natural wildlife is throughout most enclosures . in zoo that striving to do this it is okay to not have animals in their natural environment . however in some zoo which lock their animals in cages and give them nothing to do it is not okay . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those zoo have small life-like enclosures . <eos>
