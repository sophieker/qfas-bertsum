<s> size : is the size of the stimulus package appropriate ? <eos>

<s> a $ # billion stimulus package is the largest stimulus spending bill ever devised ( although there have been some tax cuts that could be considered larger ) . for this reason it should be viewed with great suspicion and at a minimum the debate over the bill and areas of wasteful spending should done patiently . rush such a large bill through congress makes little sense . <eos>

@highlight

<s> $ # billion stimulus is just too massive . <eos>
