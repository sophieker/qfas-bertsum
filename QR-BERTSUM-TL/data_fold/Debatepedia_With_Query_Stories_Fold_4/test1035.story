<s> governance : does democracy improve decision-making ? does it matter ? <eos>

<s> in proportional representative democracies it is quite common for ruling parties to form coalitions . these coalitions usually depend on smaller political parties who take an unfair advantage of this position and `` blackmail '' bigger parties on adopting specific legislation or during confidence votes . the fact that these small parties who in reality gained about 8 % of all votes are able to obstruct the whole decision-making system in effect undermines the basics of democracy : all votes are equal <eos>

@highlight

<s> tyranny of minorities . <eos>
