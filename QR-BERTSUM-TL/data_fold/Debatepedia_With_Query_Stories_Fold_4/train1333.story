<s> market value : is equal pay fair to market values ? <eos>

<s> how can this fairly be decided when men s sports dominate media coverage so thoroughly ? the market has been conditioned historically by the preferences of biased male sports administrators and media executives . do we really know that sports fans prefer men s sports or do we only know that they watch them ? in fact many viewers say that they prefer women 's tennis as it relies more on skill and less on power than the men 's game especially in fast grass services such as that at wimbledon .
