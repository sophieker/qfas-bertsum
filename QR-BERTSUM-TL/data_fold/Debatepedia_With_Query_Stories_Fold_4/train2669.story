<s> are there advantages for the church if it accepts evolution ? <eos>

<s> since macro- evolution is not valid as science in the first place as it is not an observable process the church has no need to support it . of course the church is not obliged to blindly follow science anyway but when they attempt to do so in this case they only weaken themselves . <eos>

@highlight

<s> christianity has nothing against science . <eos>
