<s> elizabeth pantley . `` there is more breast in the journalists than seen during breastfeeding . '' on opposing views.com > `` breastfeeding women are routinely asked to cover their babies or retire to a bathroom stall in the names of decency . at the same time magazines and movies routinely showcasing breasts as glamorous . a woman at work sometimes shows more cleavage than is exposed during breastfeeding and a summer beach is a sea of nearly-naked breasts . this is a baffling double standard . why are some people so afraid of seeing a breastfeeding mother ? '' <eos>

<s> breastfeeding more decent than other display of breasts <eos>
