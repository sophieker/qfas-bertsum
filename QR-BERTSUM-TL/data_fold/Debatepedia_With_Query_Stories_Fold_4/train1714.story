<s> tibor reactors : are liquids fluoride thorium reactors ( lftr ) a great idea ? <eos>

<s> lftr reactor operates at temperatures higher than than `` classical '' uranium pwrs ( pressurized water reactors ) . this translates to higher possible thermodynamic efficiency of the process of conversions of cooling to electrical energy ( up to around # % compared to around # % in the case of uranium pwrs ) . last less waste heat is produced there are lower demands on the cooling systems i.e . the cooling towers can be smaller ( compared to pwrs with equal power ) . higher operating temperatures also offering the possible of using gas turbines instead of steam turbines possibly simplifying the non-nuclear part of lftr based power plant . <eos>
