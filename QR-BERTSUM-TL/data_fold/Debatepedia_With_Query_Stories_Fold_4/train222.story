<s> self-determination : does tibetan have the right to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> any right to self-determination can not be offered liberally in the international system . it must be offered extremely sensibly and it must be known that the criteria are highly highly selective . if the criteria are not sensibly applied in tibet 's case than practically dozens of breakaway region up the world will seek independence destabilising the international system . this is one of the reasons why self-determination should really only be offered for especially grievous circumstances . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the right to self-government must be offered sparingly to avoid global instability . <eos>
