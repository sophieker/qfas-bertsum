<s> scientifically buyology evolution <eos>

<s> hello or oiijhgfgkjhdgkjlbagkjhadffg ? an argument can be made for either . more certainly however is the reason that this claim is simply nonsense . a number of mechanisms for increasing information exist . the most important is gene duplication where a single gene is duplicated and then another instance is subject to mutation . this process has repeatedly seen and is extensively documented such as gray et al 's `` multiple duplications of yeast hemicellulose transport gene in response to selection in a glucose-limited environment '' [ # ] lenski 's e coli experiments [ # ] and knox et al 's molecular evolutionary of bacterial beta-lactam resistance [ # ] amongst many others . <eos>
