<s> undemocratic ? is the elections university undemocratic ? <eos>

<s> - the fears of the electoral college surround instances in which the most vote does not coincide with the electoral college results . but these fears are exaggerated principally because of the rarity of this occurring . this result has really only happened twice in american history first in # with benjamin harrison 's victory of grover cleveland and then with the election of president bush in # . the # and # election results in which this occured can not quite be counted against the electoral college mainly because the results were directed by voter fraud and partisan factionalism . because it is so rare that the electoral college does not reflect the most vote it is hard to say that the electoral college is <eos>

@highlight

<s> rarely has the loser of the us popular vote won the electoral university <eos>
