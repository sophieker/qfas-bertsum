<s> fairness : is it possibility to determine `` fairness '' ? <eos>

<s> adam thierer . `` why the fairness doctrine is something but fair '' . cultural foundation . # oct. # - `` faulty premise # : `` fairness '' or `` fair access '' is best determined by fcc authorities [ ... ] reality : fcc bureaucrats can neither determine what is `` fair '' nor enforce it [ ... ] the second fallacy upon which the doctrine rests concerns the thought of `` fairness '' itself . as defined by advocates of the doctrine `` fairness '' apparently means that each broadcasting must offer air when to anyone with a contentious view . since it is impossible for every station to be monitoring constantly fcc regulators would arbitrarily determine what `` fair access '' is and who is entitled to it through selective enforcement .
