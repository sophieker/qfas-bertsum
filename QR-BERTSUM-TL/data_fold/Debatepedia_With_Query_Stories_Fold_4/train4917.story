<s> tourism : can a cull of kangaroos avoid damaging tourism ? <eos>

<s> kangaroo cullings could not so hugely lessen kangaroo population that there could be too few kangaroos for tourists to view . rather it could bring the kangaroo population down from `` over-population '' to a more regular population size . such a regular population size can not be seen as a problem for the tourism industry . <eos>

@highlight

<s> kangaroo cullings will not be substantial enough to damaging the tourist industry . <eos>
