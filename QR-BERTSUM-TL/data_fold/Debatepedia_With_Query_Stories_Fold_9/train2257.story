<s> rights : do women not have a right to wear the burqa/niqab ? <eos>

<s> baron bodissey . `` a yes to a burka ban is a yes to secularization . '' europe news . may # th # : `` the most important question here should be : what does it matter whether it is in the koran or is considered to be prescribed by muslim law ? religious freedom does not mean having to tolerate things that are so inhuman or undemocratic just because they were required # year months by the founder of a religion and his ideological disciples and are still seen by orthodox muslims as exemplary ( sunna ) . in a secular european state universal human rights are the terms of our mentality and our laws . blind obedience to muslim rules is not appropriate . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` god 's law '' on burqa can not override secular humans rights <eos>
