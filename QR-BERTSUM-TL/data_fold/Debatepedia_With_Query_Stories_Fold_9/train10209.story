<s> recovery : would expiring the bushes tax cuts dampens the recovery ? <eos>

<s> cbo director douglas elmendorf told cnn : `` [ it would provide ] a considerable boost to economy activity in # and beyond for a few years . '' this is precisely when the economy needs such a `` considerable boost . '' while it is true that he then said `` over time [ however ] the negative consequences of very low federal borrow build up `` extending the tax cuts should be seen as a short-term thing ; something that would be ended as soon as the economy has had a chance to recover ( within a couple of years ) . this means helping stabilize the economy while taking measures to address the longer-term deficits problems in the nation .
