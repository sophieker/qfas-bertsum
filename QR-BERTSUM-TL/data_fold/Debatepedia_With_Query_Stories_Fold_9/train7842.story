<s> we must focus on forcing europe s existing states to respect human rights and encourage organisations like the iru which already has an office in brussels to lobby to ensure that minority rights are respected in every country . encouraging political participation by individual roma is likely to be an effective and less divisive way to accelerate change both in their various home states and europe wide . there are already # romany mps and mayors in several countries and # local councillors .

<s> centuries of persecutions do not qualify the rome for nationhood : <eos>
