<s> choice : is homosexuality a choice ? is this relevant to civilian policy ? <eos>

<s> many gay members of the military make the following argument as to why it is illogical that homosexuals would choose : `` i wish i could decide who i fell in love with ; if someone thinks i would consciously choose such a life where i am forced to live in hiding and fears knowing the bulk of the population is against you is just crazy . i can t helping who i am . ' 'why would i choose to suffer like this ? ' ultimately '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> homosexual is no choice do n't ban it in military <eos>
