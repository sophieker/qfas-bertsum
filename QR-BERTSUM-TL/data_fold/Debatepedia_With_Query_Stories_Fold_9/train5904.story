<s> rising extremism ? is extremism rising in politics giving causes for more aggressive measures against it ? <eos>

<s> the bnp threat was localised in the extremes and all candidates in the general election of # losing their deposits . the success of les pen was ironically in moderating his extremist message couple with the fracturing of the left in french politics and the front nationale didn t win any french assembly seats . likewise pim fortuyn s party was culturally liberal having the same lines on immigration as the britain s labour party ! such a draconian law as proposed would be a disproportionately response to a limited threat .

@highlight

<s> there is no rising in extremism . <eos>
