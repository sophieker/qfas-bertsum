<s> vs. nuclear : should tidal energy substitute for nuclear energy ? <eos>

<s> there are many concerns surrounding nuclear energy regarding the potential radiation hazards for nuclear-plant workers and locals as well as for the environment when radioactive nuclear waste is buried . there is pressure to continue to build nuclear plants because they can supply a significant amount of electricity and do so without producing greenhouse gases like coal . yet the above concerns remain . tidal energy can act to replace nuclear-electricity generation and so by-pass these concerns . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tidal energy could replace unsafe/polluting nuclear energy . <eos>
