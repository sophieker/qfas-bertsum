<s> emissions : can hybrids vehicles significantly reduce greenhouse emissions ? <eos>

<s> globally warming is a globally crisis . it requires an immediate dramatic response . but hybrids are a half measure . they reduce emissions only slightly move cars from a terrible contributer to globally warming a notch down to a bad contributor . instead of support hybrid cars full measures must be taken with immediate moves to electric or hydrogen vehicles which emit no greenhouse gases from the tail-pipe . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hybrid car are too mild a solutions to global warming <eos>
