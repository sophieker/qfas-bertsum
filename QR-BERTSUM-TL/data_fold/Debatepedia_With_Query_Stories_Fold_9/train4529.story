<s> getting reform : is the public options a threats to reform of any kind ? <eos>

<s> the public insurance option is a compromise between the very prominent extremes of those that want the continuation of the status quo - with solely private insurance companies in charge of health health - and those that advocates for a single-payer systems in which insurance companies simply cease to exist . it is therefore unreasonable to argue that such a half-way compromise ( that concedes the possibility of destroying the insurance industry altogether with a single-payer system ) goes to far . it is a reasonable compromise that should not be seen as a deal-breaker by opponents of governments programs . <eos>
