<s> the british queen and monarch are not endowed with very much power in australia . her roles is primarily symbolic representing the commonwealth and its strong history of democracy law and faith . the symbol of the monarch should not be made into too big of an issue . keeping they symbol will do very little to harms or benefit australians ; so the status quo should be maintained . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the australia monarchies is just a `` symbol '' <eos>
