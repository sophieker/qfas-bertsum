<s> parties interest : are superdelegates important to upholding dem . parties interests ? <eos>

<s> the superdelegates system was created in # with the intent for superdelegates to vote their minds . the reason for this was indeed to provide a check on the popular vote that has the capacity to diverge from the internal principle and interest of the democratic parties ( including the interest of nominating a candidate that stand the best chances of winning in the general election ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> superdelegate should vote their beliefs not accordance to most vote . <eos>
