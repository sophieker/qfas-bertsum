<s> prisoners abuses - are women at greater risks of being abused if they become prisoners of war ? <eos>

<s> a prevalent theme in many nationalistic conflicts is to extinguish the bloodlines of the enemy culture and to proclaim that the enemy is try to do the same to them . this manifests itself especially in the different balkans conflicts as masses murders of the women of the village and a systematic rape of the women . it is unlikely that women from a third intervening power in this situation will be treated any differently if that kind of fearsome mentality has already sets into the minds of combatants .

@highlight

<s> the absence of women on the battlefield can increase the betting of physical abused and sexual trauma . <eos>
