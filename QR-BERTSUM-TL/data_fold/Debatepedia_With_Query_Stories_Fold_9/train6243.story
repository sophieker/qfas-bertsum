<s> `` keep '' : does `` keep '' in the # nd amendment refer to an individual way to `` keep '' ? <eos>

<s> if we are to read `` keep '' as meaning `` upkeep '' or maintain in the # nd amendment we are to some regard accusing the drafters of being highly misleading . the common meaning of `` keep '' at the time was not `` clean '' and `` maintain '' but possess and store . why would the drafters choosing to be so misleading ? it seems highly unlikely that they would . <eos>

@highlight

<s> why could the framers be so misleading as to conflate `` keep '' with `` upkeep '' ? <eos>
