<s> cultural preservation - should whalers be allowed in order to preserving the various cultural practices surrounding it ? <eos>

<s> involving driving whales to beach themselves and then killing them gradually with long knives or singling out vulnerable nursing mothers with calves . as only small numbers are taken with fairly primative equipment the hunters do not develop much skill or possess the technology to achieve clean and quick kills so unnecessary suffering is inevitable . and what if the whales these groups wish to hunt are from the most endangered species should they be allowed to go ahead simply because of their cultural heritage ? in any cases there are many traditional practices ( e.g . slavery female circumcision ) which have been outlawed as abhorrent in modern society .

@highlight

<s> traditional hunt method are often particularly cruel <eos>
