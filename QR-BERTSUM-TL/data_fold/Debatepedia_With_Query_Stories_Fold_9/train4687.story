<s> are christians required to keep a sabbath ? <eos>

<s> it is made quite clear in the new testament that the old testament law is no longer required to be kept . i am sure every christian here agrees with this because if they did not they would be sacrificing animals . therefore it logically follows that if old testament law need not be kept and a law appears only in the old testament it is unnecessary to keep it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> actually it is one of the jewish ten commandments . <eos>
