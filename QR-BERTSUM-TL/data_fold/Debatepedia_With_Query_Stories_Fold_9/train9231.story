<s> reasonable fight ? is bullfighting a reasonable fight ? <eos>

<s> mac mcdaniel . `` it 's time to end bullfighting . '' care # . # : `` the bulls in a standard bullfighting are drugged and confusing animals debilitated and run in circles by others who stab them with spears before the bullfighter approaches to make the `` kill shot '' with his sword . anyone who believes this fight to be fair is mistaken . by the time a bullfighter approaches to actually killing the bull the animal typically has enough spears in his neck and back muscle to prevent him from fully lifting his head . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> unfair fight ; bulls is severely injured before bullfighter <eos>
