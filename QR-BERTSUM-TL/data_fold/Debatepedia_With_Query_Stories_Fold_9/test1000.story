<s> inspiration : would a mission to mars provide needed inspiration to the world ? <eos>

<s> gregg eastbrook . `` why we should n't go to mars . '' time . january 26 2004 : `` the thought of travel to mars is exhilarating . surely men and women will someday walk upon that planet and surely they will make wondrous discoveries about geology and the history of the solar system perhaps even about the very origin of life . many times i have stared up at mars in the evening sky -- in the mountains away from cities you can almost see the red tint -- and wondered what is there or was there . [ ... ] but the fact that a destination is tantalizing does not mean the journey makes sense even considering the human calling to explore . and mars as a destination for people makes absolutely no sense <eos>

@highlight

<s> inspiration is not a sufficient justification for mars mission <eos>
