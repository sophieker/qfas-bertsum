<s> war on terror : is it wrong to think the war in iraq protects the homeland ? <eos>

<s> if the us withdrew from iraq there will be far fewer regulations of the oil revenues coming out of iraq 's oil industry . it will be far easier for al qaeda to tap into corrupt networks and control substantial oil-funding for its operations against the west . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an early us withdrawal would enable al qaeda to use iraqi oil revenue <eos>
