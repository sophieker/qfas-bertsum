<s> special-ed : does nclb do enough for special-ed children ? <eos>

<s> because no child left behind requires that 100 % of students in a school are able to pass disabled and special-ed students are often expected to pass the same exams as other students . because many of these students simply can not pass the same tests disabled students are set up to fail and schools with disabled students are set up to fail as well . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no child left behind subjects disabled to same test standards . <eos>
