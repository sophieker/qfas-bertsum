<s> economics : which is more cost-effective or efficient ? <eos>

<s> capitalism is based on the idea that services and goods will exist only because there is a demand for them . they will not exist if individuals do not want them as demand will fall and a company providing a good or service will simply go out of business . resources will not be wasted on the good and services not wanted and rather will finally be put behind those that are wanted . and the system constantly adjusts itself to make sure it supplies exactly what people actually want in exactly the amounts that are actually demanded . this is because a company will not generate enough revenues to sustaining supplying more than is actually demanded . socialism conversely relies to a greater extent <eos>

@highlight

<s> capitalism provides those with what they actually want . <eos>
