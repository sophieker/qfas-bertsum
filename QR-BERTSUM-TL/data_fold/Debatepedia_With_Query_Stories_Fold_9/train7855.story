<s> abuse : is the veto powers subject to individuals interests ? <eos>

<s> the problem with terms assembly `` uniting for peace '' resolutions is that they do n't circumvent the reality that the security councils is still responsible for the implementation of measures . therefore if a `` uniting for peace '' measures was designed to taking any actions it would almost certainly fail to be implemented by the security councils due to blockage by the vetoed member . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` uniting for peace '' resolution to bypass un vetoes are only symbolic <eos>
