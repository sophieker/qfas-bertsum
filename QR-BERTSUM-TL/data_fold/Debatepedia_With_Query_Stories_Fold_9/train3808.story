<s> greg palest . `` manchurian candidates : supreme court allows china and others unlimited spending in us elections . '' opednews . january 23rd 2010 : `` right now corporations can give loads of loot through pacs . while this money stinks ( barack obama took none of it ) anyone can go through a pac 's federal disclosure filing and see the name of every individual who put money into it . and every contributor must be a citizen of the usa . [ ... ] but under today 's supreme court ruling that corporations can support candidates without limit there is nothing that stops say a delaware-incorporated handmaiden of the burmese junta from picking a congressman or two with a cache of loot masked by a corporate alias . '' <eos>
