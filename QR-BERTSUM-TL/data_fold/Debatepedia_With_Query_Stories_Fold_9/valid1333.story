<s> darting/euthanasia : is darting and euthanizing kangaroo humane ? <eos>

<s> kangaroo culling by darts for sedation and then with poison to euthanize kangaroos can actually lead to chronic distress pain and suffering amongst individuals kangaroos and groups of kangaroos . first due to the lower accuracy of darts a sharp shooters must be much closer with darts than with bullets which sometimes disturbs the kangaroo herd . second darts do not kill kangaroos immediately nor do they immediately sedate them creating the potentially for the thrashing around of a kangaroo which results in their injury suffering and the general distress of neighboring kangaroos . third a human has to promptly approaches the drugged kangaroo and perform the euthanasia which distresses and disturbs the kangaroo herd sometimes resulting in their thrashing around in distress . <eos>
