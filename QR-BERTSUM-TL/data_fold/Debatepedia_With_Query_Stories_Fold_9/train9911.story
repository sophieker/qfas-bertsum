<s> original vote : should michigan and florida 's jan. 29th vote be used to allot delegates ? <eos>

<s> in order for citizens to cast an informed vote they must be aware of the platform and character of a candidate . this requires to some extent that voters are campaigned to by presidential candidates . in both florida and michigan due to the unseating of their delegates presidential candidates did not wage serious campaigns . subsequently the voters were uninformed of the choices confronting them . their vote therefore should not be counted as it was not as informed as otherwise would be the case . if a re-vote is possible then the candidates could wage real campaigns there the voters could become fully informed and the ultimate re-vote could be viewed as more fully informed and thus legitimate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> without candidate campaigns in michigan and florida primaries voters were uninformed . <eos>
