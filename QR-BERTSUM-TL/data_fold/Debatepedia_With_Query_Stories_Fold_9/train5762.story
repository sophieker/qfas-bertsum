<s> environment : is the three gorges dam benefiting the environment ? <eos>

<s> reservoirs worldwide are being more or less beset by floats as it intercepts floats from upstream while it holds water . the float pollution had existed before the tgd constructed . preventing upstream garbage floats from piling up at the tgd has been implemented since the tgd began to store water and generate electricity . <eos>

@highlight

<s> china is taking steps to limit garbage glut behind tgd <eos>
