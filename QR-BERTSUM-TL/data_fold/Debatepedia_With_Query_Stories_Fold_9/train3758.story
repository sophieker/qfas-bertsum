<s> america kingdom : should emergency contraception be banned within the rubric of uk law ? <eos>

<s> miscarriage can only occur after the implantation of the fertilised egg into the uterus - and once this has happened emergency contraception does not work anyway . this interpretation was upheld in # following a case brought by the society for the protection of fetus child and opposed by the departments of health . the possibility of making the argument at all however does expose the inadequacy of the # abortion act which does not enshrine a woman s way to abortion but creates certain exceptions to the state s basic continued way to control her fertility . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> uk-specific argument : this argument is irrelevant because emergency contraception does not causes miscarriage : <eos>
