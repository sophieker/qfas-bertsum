<s> kevin price the director of emba world said to mba podcaster : `` when you have those years of working experience under your belt you ve already had successes and failures in life . you already know what it may mean to seeing a business collapsing or dissolve or you seeing a business succeed or merge or acquired it may have been through a recession or two . that is an education in its own right and when you bring that back into the classroom it provide an entirely various dimension . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> younger mba students bringing more experience/perspective . <eos>
