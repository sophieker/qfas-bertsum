<s> broader philosophies : what are the opposition philosophies of each system ? <eos>

<s> capitalism is not about enriching small and powerful corporations . it was originally and remains largely about small groups of individuals in communities working them to supply collective needs . critics who talk about big corporations in capitalism typically ignore the fact that the vast majority of businesses are small community-based ones and ones in which eye-popping profits are not made . most businesses are just communities store and organizations that pay reasonable wages and that communities would sorely miss . <eos>

@highlight

<s> focus on large corporation detracts from fundamentals of capitalism . <eos>
