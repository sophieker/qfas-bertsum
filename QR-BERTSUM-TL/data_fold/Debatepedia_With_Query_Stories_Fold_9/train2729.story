<s> self-defense : were israeli soldiers protecting themselves ? <eos>

<s> the cameras phones and video-cameras of flotilla activists were confiscated by the israeli government after the ship was seized and passengers detained . this means that the gaza flotilla activists were at a significant disadvantage in sharing any evidence of israeli defense force wrong-doing . this needs to be kept in mind as the evidence is reviewed . indeed `` history is written by the winners '' and in this case it should be a concern that israel is in control of most of the evidence of the event . and it should be asked why the idf would confiscate these recording devices in the first place ? are they trying to hide something ? <eos>
