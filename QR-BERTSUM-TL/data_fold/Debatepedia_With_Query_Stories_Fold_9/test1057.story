<s> dan mclaughlin . `` why terrorists do n't deserve a court date . '' cbs . november # # : `` the trials are wholly unnecessary ; the administration is holding some enemy combatants without trial and trying others through the military commission systems thus conceding that it has alternatives . as a result any risk expenses or other drawbacks of the trials are being undertaken solely for the purpose of empty symbolism . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> military tribunals make try terrorists in court unnecessary . <eos>
