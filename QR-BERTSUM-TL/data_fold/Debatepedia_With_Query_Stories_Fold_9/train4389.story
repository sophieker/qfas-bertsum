<s> personality : does debate affect people 's behavior in a positive way ? <eos>

<s> debating as such takes up a lot of time ( research tournaments sessions with trainers ... ) which means that the best debaters tend to miss a lot of school lessons ( and other extracurricular activities ) . this in addition to general ambitiousness of debaters in long-term leads to stress which clearly ruin people 's health as well as relationships . <eos>

@highlight

<s> competitive debating is very stressful . <eos>
