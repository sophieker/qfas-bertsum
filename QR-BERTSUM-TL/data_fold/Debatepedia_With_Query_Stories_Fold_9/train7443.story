<s> general history : are tibet 's general historical claims to independence justified ? <eos>

<s> this argument is simply meant to frame the legal debate . the prc makes no claim to sovereign rights over tibet as a result of its military subjugation and occupation of tibet following the country 's invasion in # - # . china does not argue that it has acquired sovereignty by means of annexation in this period . rather it bases its claim to tibet solely on the theory that tibet has been an integral part of china for centuries . therefore the below arguments against china 's historical claims represent a complete legal case against china 's claim to sovereignty over tibet ( starting in # ) . <eos>
