<s> evolutionary defy creature <eos>

<s> creationists theorise that some reptiles evolved into mammals whilst others becoming birds . the platypus has somehow got traits different to all three types of creature but how how on earth can this be evolutionarily explained ? by the time the actually broken links between reptiles and birds and reptiles and mammals had developed the traits found in the platypus ' genome the three species would obviously be unable to reproduce with one another and could by no means therefore produce a creature capable of evolving into a platypus . the only rationality explanation for the striking similarities the platypus being a mammal has with a duck is that both creatures were separately designed by the same god . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the duck- billed platypus is an excellent example of a lives creatures which totally undermines darwinism . <eos>
