<s> feasibility : will the space-based solar power be feasible in the near future ? <eos>

<s> lightweight inflatable structures based on thin film solar cells may be suitable for deployment in space even with current launch systems . while solar cells presently used in space have too low specific power ( power to weight ratio ) to be used as a basis of an industrially sized space-based solar power farm the research into thin film photovoltaics is making steady progress in last years providing optimistic outlook for a significant increase of specific power in near future . lightweight inflatable structures based on these new thin film solar cells could make the concept of space-based solar power economically viable in the short term even without major breakthrough in space transportation . <eos>
