<s> encourage rape : does pornography encouraging rapists ? <eos>

<s> it is likely that if another is subject to the feelings murderers are then another is more inclined to use pornography not the other way round - pornography does not create rapists . the claim that pornography is rape does not holding water ; our entire legal system is dependent on a distinction between thought and acts that this claim seeks to blur . pornography is a legitimately form of expression and enjoyment and should not be censored in the interests of sexual repression and prudery . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rape will exists with or no pornography . <eos>
