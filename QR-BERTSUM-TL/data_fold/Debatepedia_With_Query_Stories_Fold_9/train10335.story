<s> in a letter to sen. robert fulbright eisenhower quoted a report in the new york times that says `` the rise in illegally crossers by mexican mexicans ( rooted from the watery route taken by the mexican immigrants across the rio grande ) to a current rate of more than # # # cases a year has been accompanied by a wondering relaxation in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the federal government . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> exploiting cheap labor is no justification for allow immigrants <eos>
