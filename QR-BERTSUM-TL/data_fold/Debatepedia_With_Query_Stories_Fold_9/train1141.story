<s> prosecution : could this lead to mass prosecution of parents with good intentions ? <eos>

<s> a bans could not lead to a mass prosecutions of parents for trivial smacks any more than adults are prosecuted for trivial assaults on other adults currently . the threat of punishment is likely to function as a deterrent and change parents ' behaviour . moreover there could be less intervention into family life by social workers than there is now . the previous law in the uk makes lawyers and prosecutors responsible for deciding if a smack hurt and thus for fine-tuning level of acceptable violent in the home . <eos>

@highlight

<s> children could not be prosectuted for each smack this is more of a deterrent . <eos>
