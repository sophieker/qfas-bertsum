<s> the pro and un arguments : <eos>

<s> nowhere in koran it is mentioned that to attain jannat or eternal one needs to kill in the name of allah . however it is mentioned that if someone enters your territory driven by unwarranted intentions then you should fight for your religions and your people . this may be true for any other religions as well i.e.to fight for the right cause for your people . this is in no way related to violence . misinterpretation of this logic has led to mis-informed and misleading of numerous young muslims to the path of terrorism and violence . <eos>

@highlight

<s> muslim worlds has had no more violence than other religions . <eos>
