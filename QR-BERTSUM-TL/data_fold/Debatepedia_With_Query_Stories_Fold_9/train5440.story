<s> economic model : are download trade and integrate the most productive economic models ? <eos>

<s> globalisation and free trade are in their infancy . the fact that it is not widespread and that many developed countries continue protectionist policies is actually the sources of many problems for develop and poor countries . these poor countries could use more free trade at this moment and to attribute the existence of free trade as the cause of these countries ' current plight could be to misunderstand how restricted globalisation actually is today . <eos>

@highlight

<s> globalisation is not rampant remaining fairly limited in scope globally <eos>
