<s> democracy : are the leaks great for democracy/transparency ? <eos>

<s> `` why wikileaks is wrong . '' wired state . november # th # : `` in that sense micah sifry 's tweet that wikileaks represents an 'open society ' is a disgraceful perversity ; and i told him so . you can hardly compare a society that is open *by consent* and by voluntary disclosure of the governed and the governing to vandals who forcibly pry open what is rightly closed . how strange that micah answers that i 'football all people ' should be interested in this openness ? ! like all the opensource thugs wikileaks violates the principle of opt-in ; and indeed there is not even an opt-out . yes most of all what 's wrong with wikileaks is that it is achieving by force without consent and without knowledge . it 's bolshevist <eos>
