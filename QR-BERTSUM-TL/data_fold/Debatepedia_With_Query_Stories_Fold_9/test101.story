<s> poverty : does progressive taxation help the poor ? <eos>

<s> `` progressive taxation '' . lolife . # june # - `` with a flat tax no one could be taxable more than they make but the taxes would but have to be fairly high on the poorest people . with a progressive tax you can generate the revenue you want while but allowing bad people the opportunity to become not-poor . this is not altruism it s an economic strategy to keep our economy strong by getting as many people participate in it as possible . the more bad people we turn into middle class people the easier the tax burden will be on everyone .
