<s> accountability : will elections make judges more or less accountable ? <eos>

<s> judges are held to account by their ability to publish dissents and by those who have the time and special knowledge needed to assess their capability . in some countries such as the uk judges can theoretically be dismissed by a vote of the legislature . <eos>

@highlight

<s> judges can be made accountable without elections . <eos>
