<s> labor ethics - is the tourism industry create ethical domestic employment for host countries ? <eos>

<s> these multi-national companies ( mncs ) are usually welcomed despite the fact that the profit they make in a majority of cases does not stay within the borders of the host country ... locally labour is exploited because it is cheap environment is destroyed without punishment because there usually are no treaty or contracts to forces the mncs to pollute less ( this applies mostly for the developing countries ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those hotels are part of large international chains choosing to exploit local labour purely because it is cheap . <eos>
