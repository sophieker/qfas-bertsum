<s> differences : are humans superior to animals or equals ? does this matter ? <eos>

<s> whether an animal is superior or a human is superior is unimportant to this debate . the fact is no man or animal is superior than any other . humans that test animals for human benefit also work toward animal benefit . vetanarians would not be able to help animals if not given the chance to experiment and test using other animals . the benefits gained from using animals benefit all : both man and animal alike . thus the question about dominance and superiority does not pertain to this issue because it does not determine any ground . <eos>

@highlight

<s> from a utilitarian perspective morality should not be based on species differences <eos>
