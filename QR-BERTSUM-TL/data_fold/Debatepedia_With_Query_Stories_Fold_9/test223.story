<s> independence : can journalism remains independent while receiving subsidies ? <eos>

<s> declan mccullagh . `` should you be taxed to subsidize 'the new york times ' ? '' . cnet . september # # - `` one argument for tax subsidies and the columbia journalism review article invokes it at length is that newspapers ' 'role of informing citizens is crucial to democracy ' through aggressive reporting on government malfeasance . but support that kind of aggressive reporting it seems to me is the worst argument for government funding -- it would be the first type of reporting killed openly or covertly when the inevitable political pressure is brought to bear . ( i wonder if i 'd even be permitted to write this commentary if my salary were paid by the government . and would a taxpayer-financed newspapers ever publish an editorial calling for lower taxes ? ) '' <eos>
