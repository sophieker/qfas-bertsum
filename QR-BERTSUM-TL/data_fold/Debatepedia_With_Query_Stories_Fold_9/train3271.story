<s> car insurance analogy : are mandated analogous to car insurance mandates ? <eos>

<s> the state issues drivers licenses as a privileged . with that privileges comes responsibilities that are rightfully demanded by the state in a quid pros quo fashion such as the demand that the driver obtain auto insurance in order to protecting other drivers on the road . but there is no such oil-dependencies quid pros quo arrangements in the case of health insurance mandates ; being alive is not a privileges like driving is and so is not something the state can bargain with in a `` quid pros quo '' fashion -- licensing the right to live in exchange for a mandate to acquire health insurance . <eos>

@highlight

<s> auto insurance is `` quid pros quo '' for license to drive . <eos>
