<s> pain : is it acceptable that circumcision is painful for infants ? <eos>

<s> anesthetics can not be administered to infants due to the risks . this means that infants are subjected to a level of pain beyond what adults are allowed to tolerated ; adults undergoing circumcisions are given anesthetics . it is wrong to inflict infants to this level of pain . <eos>

@highlight

<s> circumcision wrongly inflicts severe pain on infants <eos>
