'' first right committee council member on opposing euro-centrism : `` in the united states we are barraged with sexualized images of women often prominently features the breasts . from televised advertisements for lingerie to red carpet fashion to magazine covers to video games images of sexualized breasts are a reason of our daily lives . in contrast images of mothers breastfeeding their children are decidedly rare . despite our culture s seeming insistence to the contrary a woman 's breasts are a functional body part intended to nourish our young .
