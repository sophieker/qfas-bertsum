<s> health : is marijuana fairly harmless health-wise or even spiritually beneficial ? <eos>

<s> although cannabis does indeed have some harmful effects it is no more harmful than legal substances like alcohol and tobacco . as a matter of fact research by the british medical association shows that nicotine is far more addictive than cannabis . furthermore the consumption of alcohol and the smoking of cigarettes cause more deaths per year than does the use of cannabis ( e.g . through lung cancer stomach ulcers accidents caused by drunk driving etc. ) . the legalization of cannabis will remove an anomaly in the law whereby substances that are more dangerous than cannabis are legal whilst the possession and use of cannabis remains unlawful . <eos>
