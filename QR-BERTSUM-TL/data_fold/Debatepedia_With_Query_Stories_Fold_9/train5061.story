<s> an exception to the extreme condition on the moon is the so-called `` peaks of eternal light '' located at the lunar north pole that are constantly bathed in sunlight . the wheels of shackleton crater towards the lunar south pole also has a incessant photovoltaic illumination . this would be an ideal place for a colony . <eos>
