<s> economics : is solar energy financially sound ? <eos>

<s> the employment opportunities created by solar power are interesting because they involves a low degrees of interaction between the employee and communities that are demanding solar energy . that is solar business transactions occur at a local level in face-to-fact deals and sales . more centralized forms of energy production ( coal oil nuclear ) entail employment opportunities that often isolate employees in far off places in which they have very little interaction with the communities that they are actually serving . <eos>
