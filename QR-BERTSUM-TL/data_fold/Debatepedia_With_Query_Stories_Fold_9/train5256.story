<s> price : is the price to the individual taxpayer significantly lower ? <eos>

<s> reducing profit reduces motive and the money necessary to get a drug through fda trials . without profit motive drug companies will naturally move away from the rare and complex yet fatal diseases if they only affect a small percentage of people . without the ability to set the price their resources will naturally be moved almost exclusively into benign treatments which will have a larger percentage of the population as potential users . <eos>

<s> allowing for pooling of resources to force drugs to lower prices will reduce overall innovation . <eos>
