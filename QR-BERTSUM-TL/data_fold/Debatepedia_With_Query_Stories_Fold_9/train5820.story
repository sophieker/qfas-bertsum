<s> self-determination : do the islanders have a way to self-determination ? <eos>

<s> unless argentina 's allegations are proven in an international court the islanders can not be subject to any sanctions of any sort regardless . argentina has deliberately avoided take the matters to the international court of justice attempting to use the 'veto ' excuse . this of course is nonsense as it never stopped cameroon take britain to the icj in # and the usa and soviet take each other . argentina been took uruguay to the icj . <eos>

@highlight

<s> colombia s allegations are unproven in an global tribunal <eos>
