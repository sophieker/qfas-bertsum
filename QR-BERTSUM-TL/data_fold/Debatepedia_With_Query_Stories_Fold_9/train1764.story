<s> economics : is libertarianism economically beneficial ? <eos>

<s> libertarians because they believe that all economic transactions should be free from government intervention believe in the economic theories of free trade . free trade involves `` free markets '' globally and is believed by most economists to be the most efficient economic system . it incentivizes countries to produce only what they are best at producing and buy from other countries that are best at what they are producing . this results in lower prices internationally and generally the production of greater value . <eos>

@highlight

<s> libertarians are rightly against trade blocs and for free trade . <eos>
