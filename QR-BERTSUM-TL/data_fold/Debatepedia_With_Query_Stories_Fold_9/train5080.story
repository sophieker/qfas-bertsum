<s> clones safety : does human cloning encounter safety problems ? <eos>

<s> the nuclear transfer technique that produced dolly required # embryos from which only one healthy and viable sheep was produced . the other foetuses were hideously disfigured and either died or were aborted . moreover ian wilmut and other commentators have noted that we can not know whether clones will suffer from premature ageing as a result of their elderly genes . there are also fears that the reprogramming of the nucleus of a somatic cell in order to trigger the cell division that lead to the cloned of an individual may result in a significantly increased risk of cancer . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cloning technology is unsafe for the resulting life . <eos>
