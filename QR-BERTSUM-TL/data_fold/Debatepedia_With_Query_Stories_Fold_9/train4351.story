<s> immediate stimulus : does the bills provide sufficient immediate stimulus ? <eos>

<s> steven pearlstein . `` wanted : personal economic trainers . apply at capitol . '' washington post . february # # - `` let s review some of the more silly argument about the stimulus bill starting with the notion that 'only ' # percent of the money can be spent in the next two years and the rest is therefore 'wasted . ' as any economist will tell you the economy tends to be uncertainties and emotional . so if businesses and households can see immediate benefits from a program while knowing that a bit more stimulus is on the way they are likely to feel more confident that the recover will be sustained . that confidence in turn will make them more likely to take the risk of buying big-ticket items <eos>

<s> longer-term spend is not `` waste '' ; helps sustaining stimulus <eos>
