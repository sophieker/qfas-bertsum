<s> do people go to zoos for entertainment ? is this okay ? <eos>

<s> zoos nowadays are not marketed as places of entertainment - they are places of education . most modern zoos have their main emphasis on conservation and education - the reason that so many schools take children to zoos is to teach them about nature the environment endangered species and conservation . far from encouraging bad treatment of animals zoos provide a direct experience of other species that will increase ecological awareness . <eos>
