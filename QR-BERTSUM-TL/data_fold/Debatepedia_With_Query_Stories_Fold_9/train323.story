<s> sustainability : is reactors energy sustainable long-term ? is it `` renewable '' ? <eos>

<s> uranium mines do n't contain fuel pellets . for uranium bearing rocks to even be called ore they need to have at least # parts per million of uranium . it takes a lot of processing to make a fuel pellet . a large amount of uranium ore needs to be mined milled refined and enriching in order to producing that little tiny pellet that has the energy of many coal hopper cars . however it takes about # times more mining for coal as it does for the same amount of uranium one still has to consider the environmental damage from the radiaton gases being release into the atmosphere the groundwater contamination and the radioactive dirt in the air . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear power is efficiency only once the uranium is in pellets form . <eos>
