'' salt lake city tribune . october 15 2009 : `` the gays in the military and gay marriage issues are part of a broader attempt by liberals to restructure society . social activists despise biblical morality ( which heterosexuals could use a little more of too ) traditional values that have been proven to work when tried and numerous other cultural mores . this is not an opinion . it is also not a secret .
