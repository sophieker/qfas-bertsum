<s> accountability : does k-12 make teachers and schools more accountable ? <eos>

<s> punishing teachers for the poor performance of students fails to address the central issue ; how to better or differently instruct students . teachers been have the best interest of their students at heart . punishing them wrongly assumes that this is not the case or that teachers can not simply recognize the need to improve their method if things are not going well . <eos>
