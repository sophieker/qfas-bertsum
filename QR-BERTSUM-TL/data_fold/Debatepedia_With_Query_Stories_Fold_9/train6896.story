<s> crime : would crime increase in a libertarian society ? <eos>

<s> because libertarians uphold the absolute rights of individuals against government a problem occurs in regards to how criminals are dealt with . the problem is that it may become difficult or impossible to imprison or punish criminals ( e.g . by fining them and depriving them of some property ) if their rights are inviolable by government . this is a dangerous situation and would likely reduce the fears in the minds of criminals associated with committing crimes . <eos>

@highlight

<s> libertarianism would give criminals an immunity from loss <eos>
