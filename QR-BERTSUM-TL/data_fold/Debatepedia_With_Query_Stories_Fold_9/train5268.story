<s> dominion : do humans not have dominion over animals ( and a right to eat them ) ? <eos>

<s> there are certain animals that have evolved with humans through mutual self-interests in survival to become `` domesticated '' by humans . cats dogs pigs and chickens are examples . our `` dominion '' over these animals is certainly biological and evolutionary . farming and eating these animals is merely a continuation of this evolutionary history of domestication . it is not wrong or right ; it simply is . <eos>
