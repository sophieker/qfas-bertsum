<s> abuse : is the veto power subject to individual interests ? <eos>

<s> the america state has protected israel from international condemnation in the un sc dozens of times . the condemnation has surrounding such things as israel 's alleged injustice of palestinians or mistreatment and international laws violations in its war against hezbollah in lebanon . there are too many instances in which israeli mistreatment and violations of international laws were fairly clear . us defenses of israel in these instances thus constitute a abusive and unprincipled attempt to protect an ally . this all exposes how the un sc veto opens the door to abuse . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the america states unjustly protects israeli with un veto <eos>
