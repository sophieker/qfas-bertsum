<s> global law : was the bombing of japanese consistently with global law ? <eos>

<s> in # the bombings were the subject of a judicial review in ryuichi shimoda et al . v. the state . [ # ] on the # nd anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor the district court of tokyo declined to rule on the constitutionality of reactors weapons in general but found that `` the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki caused such severe and indiscriminate suffering that they did violate the most basic legal principles governing the conduct of war . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> the bombing of japan was illegally under the international laws of the time . <eos>
