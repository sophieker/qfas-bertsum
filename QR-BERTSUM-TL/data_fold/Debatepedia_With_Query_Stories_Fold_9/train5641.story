'not all embryonic-stem-cell lines are created equal ' says dr. arnold kriegstein who runs the institute for regeneration medicine at the university of california san francisco . 'some are more readily driven down a certain lineage such as heart cells while others more easily become nerve . we do n't understand how it happens but it does mean we need diversity . ' '' <eos>
