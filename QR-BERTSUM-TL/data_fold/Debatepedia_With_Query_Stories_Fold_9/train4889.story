<s> citizen decisions : are citizens good at making policy ? <eos>

<s> the people are right when they oppose a policy in their neighbourhood that would worsen their quality of life . the politicians who advocate new nuclear power plants or motorways are usually unwilling to have them at their own back-garden ; why should the ordinary people be different ? in summary nimbyism is beneficial for society because it prevents wrong decisions made by people who would n't have to carry the burden of living in a particular area . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nothing wrong about nimbyism through initiatives . <eos>
