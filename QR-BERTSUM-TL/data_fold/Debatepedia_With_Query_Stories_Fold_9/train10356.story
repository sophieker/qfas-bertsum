<s> a principal # th century liberal theorists john rawls originated the idea of a the `` veil of ignorance '' . the idea is that imagining we all had no idea how we would `` come out of the womb '' and if we would be `` advantaged or disadvantaged '' what kind of social contract would we construct . we would want to construct one in which we minimized the risks to ourselves if we happened to get the `` short-end of the stick '' . this is why a degree of `` equality of outcome '' is important . communism and socialism recognize these ideas . <eos>

<s> liberals democracies should ensure a degrees of `` equality of outcome '' <eos>
