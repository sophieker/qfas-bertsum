<s> crime : does capital punishment help protect the public and deter crime ? <eos>

<s> steven farrell professor of political economy at george wythe college . `` a conservative case for the capital punishment '' . # mar . # - `` the legitimate role of government involves the protection of life liberty and property . just as the role of the government is to raise an armed force and rain down deadly force upon a bloodthirsty invading army so also the government is duty bound to inflict death upon the man who chooses to slaughter fellow citizens in their own backyards . few if any object to the use of deadly force against an invading army . yet those invading soldiers ordered to fight and likely whipped up by propaganda to go into battle are far less deserving of death than the assailant <eos>
