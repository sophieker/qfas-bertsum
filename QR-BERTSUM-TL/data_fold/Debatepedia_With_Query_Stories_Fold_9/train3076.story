<s> framers : did the framers of the constitution support an individual right ? <eos>

<s> although the early american documents proclaimed equality for all and a right for all to bear arms in actuality this was not the case . native americans african americans and other visible minority groups were not given the same rights as those white americans who immigrated from europe . lynchings and other acts of injustice based upon racial difference occurred well into the twentieth century so it is a misrepresentation of the facts to say every individual had the right to bear arms for self-defense . for much of american history a large segment of the american population did not even have basic human rights let alone the right to bear arms . <eos>

@highlight

<s> 2nd amendment rights did not extend to all ethnic groups in terms of initial practice <eos>
