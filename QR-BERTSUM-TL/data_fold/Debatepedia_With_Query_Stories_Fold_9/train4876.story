<s> rights : is `` do n't ask do n't tell '' inconsistent with citizens ' rights ? <eos>

<s> `` the pentagon 's new policy guidelines on homosexuals in the military '' . the new york times . july 20 1993 : `` sexual orientation will not be a bar to service unless manifested by homosexual conduct . the military will discharge members who engage in homosexual conduct which is defined as a homosexual act a statement that the member is homosexual or bisexual or a marriage or attempted marriage to someone of the same gender . '' [ 13 ] in other words the policy does not prohibit being gay in the military but only expressions of that homosexuality . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` do n't ask do n't tell '' forbids homosexual acts not gays <eos>
