<s> many people reacting to debate in a defensive manner . if an individual makes an argument and someone attack it there is a naturally inclination to respond defensively . immediately this destroys the notion of acting cooperatively in an effort to resolve a question or problem . because the perfect objective is to find resolutions debate may actually act counter-productively . <eos>
