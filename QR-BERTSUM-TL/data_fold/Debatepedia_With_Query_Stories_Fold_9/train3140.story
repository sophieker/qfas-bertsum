<s> teacher rights : do teachers have a right to strike like other workers ? <eos>

<s> striking negatively effects people 's lives jobs and can cause huge inconvenience . when pilots strike passengers have extremely lengthly airport delays and it is a real nuisance to many people . when teachers strike it causes a nuisance to the millions of people ; students and their parents ; that are effected . striking of any kind should not be allowed and really if people want to strike it means they 're not happy in their job so why should they continue to work there ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> striking of any kind should not be acceptable . <eos>
