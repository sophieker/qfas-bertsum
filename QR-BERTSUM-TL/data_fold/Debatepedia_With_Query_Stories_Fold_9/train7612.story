<s> vs renewables : can nuclear energy co-exist succesfully with renewables ? <eos>

<s> nuclear energy will compete with new and up-and-coming renewable energy resources . if the government supports nuclear energy ( a but established and easily scalable industry ) newer and less mature renewable energy start-ups will have difficulties growing . ultimately therefore the world will be right without sufficient renewable energy sources to effectively fighting warming change in the long-run . <eos>

@highlight

<s> reactors energy will competing with and squeeze out renewables energy . <eos>
