<s> the european central bank : is it worse than national central banks ? <eos>

<s> the ecb has too large a constituency too large a responsibility and too large a power : it becomes impossible to respond swiftly with a bureaucratic apparatus as big as the ecb has to have to keep checks on the entire eurozone . ( yes it can partially rely on existing infrastructure of extant national central banks but if so why not allow them to decide about specific steps needed in each country ? ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> ecb is unresponsive . <eos>
