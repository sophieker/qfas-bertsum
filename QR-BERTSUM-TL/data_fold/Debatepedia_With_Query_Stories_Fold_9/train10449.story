<s> international stability : does outsourcing foster international cooperation respect and stability ? <eos>

<s> offshoring portrays underdeveloped countries as being cheap sources of support for the developed economies . the focus is not on helping the poorer countries to develop strong economies but to exploit their weaknesses to satisfy the consumer culture of richer countries . in doing this the mass export of roles which depend on cultural knowledge ( for example call centre jobs ) imposes an alien and patronising cultural framework onto local workers . <eos>

@highlight

<s> offshoring is a form of economic and cultural imperialism . <eos>
