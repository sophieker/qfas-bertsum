<s> threat : does the communist parties particular a threat ? <eos>

<s> while there are some thing society disagrees on there are other thing that we agree on and can establish as norms standards and morals . in setting these norms and laws we establish that their violation can instantly be deemed a threat to society . disagreement among accepted political parties exists in the area in which societies have not formed a consensus on the `` threat/harm '' of differing policies . that 's why such disagreement is tolerated ; we 're not sure of the true effects . yet if society is able to deem by general consensus that a political party violates these norms then that party should be deemed a threat to the society and thereby excluded from politics . <eos>

@highlight

<s> society can developing a general disagreement about what views can poses a `` threat '' . <eos>
