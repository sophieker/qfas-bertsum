<s> socialized medicine : is it mistake to call single-payer system socialized medicine ? <eos>

<s> medical resources are rationed in socialized systems so that some those are either denied care or have to wait for it . if a person is `` rationed out '' of the public health care service ( perhaps because the treatment is not considered effective or costs effective enough to warrant intervention ) they will be can seek alternative treatment in the private sector . if they can not afford private care they may have to go without . <eos>

@highlight

<s> universal health health lead to rationing . <eos>
