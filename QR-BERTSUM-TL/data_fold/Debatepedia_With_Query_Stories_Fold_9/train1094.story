<s> intimidation : would the efca reduce intimidation ? <eos>

<s> supporters of the employee free choice act argued that during the weeks ( or months ) it took to set up the election management often conducted efforts to dissuade workers from organizing . many workers reported being threatened with replacement if they ever ( as part of a union ) chose to strike . others claimed that employers predicted future workplace closures which under current law was legal so long as they did not threaten it . in some cases employers were even reported to have fired worker activists in an attempt to deter future unionization efforts knowing it would take years for reinstatement orders to take effect .
