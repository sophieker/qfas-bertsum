<s> school choice : does nclb offer good choices of schools to students and parents ? <eos>

<s> underperforming children often have no choice to transfers from one school to another when all schools are `` underperforming '' or `` failing '' in which cases schools frequently deny underperforming students access - as a meaning of keeping up their school 's test score so as to avoiding being labelled `` failing '' and punished . <eos>

@highlight

<s> `` failing '' schools will not accepting `` failing '' students . <eos>
