<s> jesse michael u.s. civil liberties activist now in favors of legal abortion in national right to life news ( january # ) - `` there are those who argue that the right to privacy is of [ a ] higher order than the right to life ... that was the premise of slavery . you could not protest the existence or treatments of slaves on the plantation because that was private and therefore outside your right to be concerned . '' thus even if a woman has a right to her body and to `` choice '' this right is overridden by the fetus 's right to life . and what could be more important than life ? all other liberties including the daughter s right to choice surely stems from a prior <eos>

@highlight

<s> the way to choice/privacy ( abortion ) does not override the way to lives <eos>
