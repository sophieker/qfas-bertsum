<s> economics : is tidal energy robust and viable economically ? <eos>

<s> while it is possible that tidal energy will become viable in the future it is a very young resource compared to other renewables so can not be expected to be viable for possibly decades to come . this compares starkly with alternative forms of renewable energy that are viable now . governments should invest in renewable energy that is viable at this time not in the uncertain future of tidal energy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tidal energy is new ; it will be some time before it is viable . <eos>
