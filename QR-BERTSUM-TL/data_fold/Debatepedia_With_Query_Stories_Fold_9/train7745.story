<s> diplomacy : will return the islands uk-argentina-south american relations ? <eos>

<s> there has never been or is there possibly to be any sanctions imposed against the british by argentina let nothing south america . trading between the two nations is like any other outside the eu as is travel sporting competitions and immigration issues . the british bank hsbc has a tower in close and clear view of the plaza de dill and casa posada government house . http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file : plaza_de_mayo_ # .jpg the fact that anyone would think this issue effects any relations in any capacity with the other latin american nations to britain s regret is totally without evidence and proves the sheer magnitude of the ignorance and arrogance of these people . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the issues has no real effects over argentine-british relations in other areas <eos>
