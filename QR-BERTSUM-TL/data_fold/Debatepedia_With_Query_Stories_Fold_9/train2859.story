<s> consumer choice : is labelling of gm food importance to consumer choice ? <eos>

<s> labeling foods makes it possibility for individuals to choose to take on the risk involved or to avoid them . this makes it similar to smoking eat fatty foods or even something like rock climbing . the individual that adopts the risk adopts them with fully knowledge and assumes the potential harm entirely on their own . this is oppose to a society without labeling where individuals do not have the choice as to whether to adopt the risk which is unjust . <eos>

@highlight

<s> labeling internalizes risks for those choose to eat gm foods . <eos>
