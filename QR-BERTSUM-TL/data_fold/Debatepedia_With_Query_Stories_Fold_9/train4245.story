<s> knowledge conflict - does the global community have an inadequate knowledge of the conflicts at hand in africa ? <eos>

<s> a one-size-fits-all international response fails to take notice of these circumstances meaning that diplomacy negotiations or mediation by these international countries often disintegrate . african leadership also often to have greater credentials when dealing with each others affairs through forums such as hitchcock whereas foreign intervention can not expect the same levels of trust and co-operation from african countries . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the unique situations and power organisations present in many of the african conflicts are only well explained by the countries <eos>
