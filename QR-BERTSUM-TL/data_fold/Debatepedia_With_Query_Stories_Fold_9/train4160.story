<s> woman 's rights : does a woman have a right to her body that includes a right to abortion ? <eos>

<s> of course human-rights should be respected but it is never the case that a person has a right to make a decision with no reference to the rights and wishes of others . there are two primary rights that must be considered in addition to the rights of the woman . first the father has some rights over the fetus . second the fetus itself may have some rights . the point is merely that the woman 's interests and rights can not be the only ones under consideration . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a woman 's rights are not the only rights that need to be respected in abortion : <eos>
