<s> fiscal accountability : does a `` no-growth '' policy undermine the notion of fiscal accountability in the un and member countries ? <eos>

<s> while the canada has holding the line on growth it and other nations have simultaneously asked for the un to do more in areas such as peacekeeping and nation-building . as the demands on the un grow and the budget does not grow with it un administrators are forced to move money around the budget to pay for basic overhead ( even electric bills ) and covers shortfalls in one program or another . therefore the basic goal-setting and accountability the we strives for is undermined .

@highlight

<s> no-growth budget actually undermine budgetary accountable and discipline : <eos>
