<s> physicians : is free universal health care reasonable to physicians ? <eos>

<s> one can not have a right to other people 's services . does a physician not have the free right of association and contract with patients ? why would physicians be forced to perform free or pre-agreed prices for their labor ? why should n't they be can to charge market value for their services ? did they enter into their practices with the understanding that they would not be can to charge fair market value ? no . they are generally service providers like any other that expect fair market-driven compensation . universal health care would deprive physicians of this freedom to charge market-value by impose government price on their service almost definitely at a discounted rate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> a right to healthcare care violate the liberties of physicians <eos>
