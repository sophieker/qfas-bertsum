<s> economics : does socialism make an economic sense ? <eos>

<s> economies in capitalist systems are essentially unplanned so they often crash producing depressions that damage the lives of millions . socialist economies are planned which means that problems can be foreseen and prevented . ultimately socialism guides with the aim of human happiness in mind rather than the glorification or gratification of a particular individual or class . <eos>

@highlight

<s> unplanned capitalist economies undergo dramatic volatility . <eos>
