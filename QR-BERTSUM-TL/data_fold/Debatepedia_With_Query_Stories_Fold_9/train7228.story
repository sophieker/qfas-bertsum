<s> border security : will a # -mile fence help stop illegal immigration ? <eos>

<s> many opponents of a fence point out that it would leave over # miles of border without any fencing and that it is not directly tied to needed comprehensive immigration reform . however numerous sources maintain that such a fence could conceivably be added to with time potentially completing a fence that spans the entire border and that the border fence legislation is only a first step in a broader comprehensive immigration reform process . <eos>
