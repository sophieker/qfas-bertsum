<s> vs. electrical vehicles : how do hybrids compare with electrical vehicles ? <eos>

<s> owners of electric car generally have to plug them in every night in their garage . this goes two seconds and does not require that the owner attend to the fuel gauge . it compares favorably to going to a gas station ( an extra trip ) and physically pumping gas which requires waiting until the tanks is filled . plugging-in your vehicle requires less time and is more convenient . <eos>

<s> plugging-in you car at night is easer than pumping gas . <eos>
