<s> necessity : is a personal safety zone necessary to protecting celebrities from the paparazzi ? <eos>

<s> the paps constantly invading and attack private lives of celebrities by trespassing on private property to get illegal and sometimes defaming photographs . the taking of pictures while on private property is definitively defined as 'illegal ' but most paps ignore the law and pay only a major fine if they get caught . this fine is easily covered by the money they make from the photographs they manage to keep ; this being so there should be more strictly defined safety zones for celebrities which if invaded will yeild major penalties . yet another reason for safety zones would be safety in public . another instance in which the paps were legally blamed for the death of a celebrity was the death of princess <eos>
