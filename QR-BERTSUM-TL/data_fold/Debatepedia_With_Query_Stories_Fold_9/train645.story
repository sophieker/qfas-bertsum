<s> non-smoking bars are rare in the united states . this suggests that culture is accepting of people who smoke in bars . it is the norm for americans to drink beer and smoke . most people who go to bars must not mind smoke that much . if they did they would not go . while for some non-smokers the presence of smoke may be bothersome but it is usually not a dealbreaker .

<s> the demand for non-smoking bars has been low . <eos>
