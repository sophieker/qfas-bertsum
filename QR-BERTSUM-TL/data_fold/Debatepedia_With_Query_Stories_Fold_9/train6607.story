<s> proportionality : were israeli strikes proportional to the hamas attacks ? <eos>

<s> alan dershowitz . `` israel 's policy is perfectly 'proportionate ' '' . wall street journal . january # # - `` the claim that israel has violated the principle of reasonableness -- by killed more hamas terrorists than the number of israeli civilians killing by hamas rockets -- is absurd . first there is no legal equivalence between the deliberate killed of innocent civilians and the deliberate killings of hamas combatants . under the law of war any number of combatants can be killing to prevent the killed of even another innocent civilian . '' <eos>

<s> israel need not be `` proportional '' against hezbollah terrorist attacks <eos>
