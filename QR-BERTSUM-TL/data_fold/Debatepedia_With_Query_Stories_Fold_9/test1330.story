<s> individual effects : is gambling generally harmful to the individual gambler ? <eos>

<s> gamblers know that overall they are likely to lose either . they gamble because it is a leisure pursuit that they enjoy . there is nothing irrational about this . some people get an enjoyable thrill from the remotely possibility that they might win a huge prize even if they lose they enjoy the experience . some forms of gambling are highly sociable . for example many people go to bingo halls to spent time with friends . societies accept people spending ( wasting ? ) money on other leisure pursuits with no material benefits ( e.g . cinema ticket watching sport ) gambling should not be any different . it is patronizing to suggest that people include those on low incomes should not be able to choose how they spent <eos>

@highlight

<s> contention that the general individuals losses from casino are justified by it being a fun and leisurely activity worth `` paying '' <eos>
