<s> partying : does off-campus living foster more modestly drunk habits ? <eos>

<s> i spoke to a women today about living on campus at colleges and she says that at private schools there is really no partying that goes on . she says in dorms that most partying happens are co-ed dorms . when the two genders get together there is more of a chance to have a party with drugs or alcohol . <eos>

@highlight

<s> single-sex dorm are a good means to decrease on-campus drinking . <eos>
