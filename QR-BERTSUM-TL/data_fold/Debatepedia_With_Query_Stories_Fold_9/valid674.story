<s> citigroup recovery : are bonuses essential to aig 's recovery ? <eos>

<s> david weidner marketwatch : `` i think what we 're doing here is we 're cutting off our nose to spite our face because you 're going to go after these bonuses you 're creating a lot of disruption at aig . and right now aig as a company is not ; it 's not business as usual . this company is struggling . its insurance business is struggling . they 're trying to unwind you know billions in derivative contracts . [ ... ] they need people all hands on deck . they need to be focused . i do n't care how terrible they are . they are the people in these jobs . and i think that we 're risking billions and billions more by clogging up aig and its management with fighting these bonuses and answering subpoenas . <eos>
