<s> general public : does philosophical property harm or help the general public ? <eos>

<s> eben moglen dotcommunist manifesto - `` society confronts the straightforward reason that when everyone can posses every intellectual work of beauty and utility -- reaping all the human value of every increase of knowledge -- at the same costs that any one person can posses them it is no longer moral to exclude . if rome possessed the powers to feed everyone amply at no greater costs than that of caesar 's own table the people would sweep caesar violently away if anyone were left to starve . but the bourgeois system of ownership demands that knowledge and culture be rationing by the abilities to pay . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> philosophical property rights help ration plentiful resources . <eos>
