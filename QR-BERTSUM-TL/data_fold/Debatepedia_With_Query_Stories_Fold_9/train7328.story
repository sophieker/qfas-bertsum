<s> consumer safety : are gm foods safe/healthy for consumers ? <eos>

<s> `` to understand what gmos are and how they affect our health and the environment we should at very least address the issue in terms of hazards rather than risks . it is even more important however to consider the ways in which these hazards occur within a free enterprise system . that way we will be able to see a number of rather predictable connections between free markets and the erosion of public interest safeguards including public health and safety environmental degradation and even human rights . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> gm foods are hazardously controlled by unaccountable corporations <eos>
