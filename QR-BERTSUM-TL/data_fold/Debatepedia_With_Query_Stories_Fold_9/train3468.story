<s> darting/euthanasia : is darting and euthanizing kangaroos humane ? <eos>

<s> cullings can involves darts sedation first and then euthanasia with lethal injection . of the many ways to cull an overpopulated animal population this is the most humane subjecting marsupials to very little physical violence and destructive force . instead of firing a bullet through the head of a kangaroo a gruesome prospect euthanasia involves darting the animal and than peacefully euthanizing it . by subjecting the kangaroo to far less physical trauma euthanasia is a far more dignified and thus humane process . while the question of the level of pains between cullings that involves shooting kangaroo and cullings that involves dart/euthanasia can be debated the question of the dignity of the processes is far less debatable . blowing a hole through a marsupials <eos>

@highlight

<s> kangaroos can be culled inhumanely through anesthetic then abortion <eos>
