<s> tobacco ads : should smokers advertisements be limited or banned ? <eos>

<s> there is no good evidence that or of these measures would have an impact on the rates of tobacco consumption . cigarette companies claim that advertisements are simply to persuade people to switch brands not to start smoking in the first place . people start smoking through peer pressure - surely the more of a 'forbidden fruit ' cigarettes become the more attractive they will be to adolescents . as for health warnings if the understanding that cigarettes have serious health risks deterred people from smoking then no-one would smoking any more . people start and continue to smoking in the full understanding of the health risks .

<s> advertisements do not force people to smoke . <eos>
