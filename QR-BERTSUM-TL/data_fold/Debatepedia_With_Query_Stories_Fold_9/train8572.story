<s> decency : is bullfighting decent or does it verge on animal torture ? <eos>

<s> ernest hemingway : `` the only place where you could see life and death i. e. violent death now that the wars were over was in the bull ring and i wanted very much to go to spain where i could study it . i was trying to learn to write commencing with the simplest things and one of the simplest things of all and the most fundamental is violent death . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> bullfighting fosters an understanding of violent death . <eos>
