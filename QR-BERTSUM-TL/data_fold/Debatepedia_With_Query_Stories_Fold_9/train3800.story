<s> not torture ? is it mistake to calling waterboarding torture ? <eos>

<s> - waterboarding seems to match the definition of the # bybee memo in which assistant aj jay bybee defined tortures as `` physical pains amounting to tortures must be equivalent in intensity to the pains accompanying seriously physical injury such as organ failure impaired of bodily function or even death '' . waterboarding certainly fits the criteria of `` impairment of bodily function '' since breath can obviously be considered a major `` bodily function '' . also because lungs are organs fill them with water does meet the criteria of inducing `` organ failure '' . <eos>

@highlight

<s> waterboarding but fit the bybee memo definition of tortures <eos>
