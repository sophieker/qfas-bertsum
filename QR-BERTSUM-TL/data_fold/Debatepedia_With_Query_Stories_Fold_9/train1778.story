<s> deficits : is the us budgets deficit a seriously problem and priority ? <eos>

<s> in the absence of debt monetization when the government borrows money from the savings of others it consume the amount of savings there are to lend . if the government were to borrow less that money would be freed to work in the private sector and would lower interest rates overall . lastly raise interest rates is one of the traditional ways that the u.s. federal reserve uses to combat inflation ( which can be brought on by government debt ) but a large national debt figure makes it difficult to do so because it raises the interest paid in servicing that debt . <eos>

@highlight

<s> deficit spending strengthens us exports by make them less expensive abroad . <eos>
