<s> minority rights : does the filibusters help upholding minority rights ? is this good ? <eos>

<s> randy barnett one of the burgeoning field of volokh conspirators argued against the filibuster on the following grounds : `` the contemporary filibuster is a polite affair . charles schumer does not talking through the night bleary eyed and exhausted . why not ? couldn t the filibuster be broken if the republicans forced the democrats to go # / # ? no . because the # / # option probably gives an advantage to the minority . why ? in order to force a # / # filibuster the majority must maintain a quorum at all times but the minority need only have one senator present to maintain the filibuster . so # / # both exhausts and distracts the majority while allowing the minority the opportunities to rest and carry on their ordinary business . [ emphasis added . ] <eos>
