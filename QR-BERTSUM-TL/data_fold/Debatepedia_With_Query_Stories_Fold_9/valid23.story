<s> elite culture : do subsidy benefit mostly the affluent and elite ? <eos>

<s> government art funding sometimes subsidises the favourite leisure pursuits of the elite who staff the government such as opera and ballet . why are these more deserving of subsidy than rock concerts or football matches ? it is a peculiarly regressive form of government to take money from the poor in tax to spend on the playthings of the rich . <eos>
