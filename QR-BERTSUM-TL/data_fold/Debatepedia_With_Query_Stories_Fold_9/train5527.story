<s> risks : are there major risks/unintended consequences with geoengineering ? <eos>

<s> one of the simplest ways to combat climate change is by painting houses white . as we all know the colors white reflects the sun sending more solar radiation back into space instead of allowing it to remain in the earth 's atmosphere where it can heat the climate . there are no negative effects to the climate by painting a roof a different color . if employed in a large enough area it could reflect enough solar rays to cool the surrounding area a few degrees . this and many other `` geoengineering '' approaches like reforestation are innocuous and yet are sometimes binding up in the illogical fears that sometimes surround the field of geoengineering as a whole . <eos>

@highlight

<s> those geo-engineering approaches are harmless like painting roofs . <eos>
