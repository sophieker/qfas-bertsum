<s> choice : is a ban consistent with consumers choice ? <eos>

<s> it is all good and great to call for an `` education campaign '' to informing consumers of what they are eating . but this is very often just not enough . no matters what the government does people will simply missed the `` instructional '' information provided by the government and will continue to consume transgender fats no full information concerning its negative effects . in such circumstances it is the government 's job to step in a take action through a ban or other measures . <eos>

@highlight

<s> govt should protect consumers when consumers are n't completely informed . <eos>
