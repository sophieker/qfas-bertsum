<s> killed calves : is it acceptable to kill babies calves for veal ? <eos>

<s> almost all calves that have never exist have been use for human use . this is extremely unfair and is a complete abuse to animal rights and dignity . humans using calves for many purposes including tenderloin which is a main resource . but it is not fair for humans get get food and dairy out of calves because humans do not giving something back to these poor calves . <eos>

@highlight

<s> beings use products from calf but calf do not use human products . <eos>
