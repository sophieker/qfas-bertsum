<s> societal arguments - could society benefit in general from a ban on partially birth abortions ? <eos>

<s> the argument here is that the provisions given to a woman should be as flexibility as possible affording her the `` right '' to make life-changing choices throughout the entire course of her pregnant and not locking her into an undesirable pregnant after a particular point as would be the case with a partial birth abortion ban . on an issues where great life-changing impact can occur from singular mistakes and particularly when these mistakes are frequently made during an immature emotional periods in a woman 's life it may be important for society to provide women with the benefit of the doubt and the flexibility to make major decision throughout their pregnancy . <eos>

@highlight

<s> part of the mistake that a girls or woman might have made is not having used sex protection and/or not <eos>
