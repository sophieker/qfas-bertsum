<s> economics : is the migrant rights treaty good for economies ? <eos>

<s> in order for governments to comply with the migrant rights treaty they will have to enforce it within their territories which requires spending money and directing resources toward creating new laws and/or tweaking old laws in order to ensure compliance with the treaty and in order to ensure employers and institutions are in compliance . businesses must spend money to ensure they are in compliance as well . while this alone does not disqualify the treaty it is important to recognize it as a cost and a con . <eos>

@highlight

<s> compliance with migrant rights treaty could be expensive . <eos>
