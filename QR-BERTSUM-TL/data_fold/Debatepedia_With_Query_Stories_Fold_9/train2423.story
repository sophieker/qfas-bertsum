<s> costs and economics : are the costs of zero tolerance laws tolerable ? does it stimulate economy growth in any way ? <eos>

<s> or we have to throw limitless money at doubling the number of officers ( it is almost impossible to recruit and train so many even if we could afford it ) . or we have to divert officers away from investigations and serious crime prevention in order to put them back on the pavement . this reduces detection of important crimes in returns for catching graffiti artists . even when reported crime rate drop this does not prove that zero tolerance achieves anything because it is corporate crime small scale drug dealing that is ignored and these are rarely reported . a patrolling officer might pass a burglary every # years and probably would n't notice it .

@highlight

<s> the expense of zero tolerance in money and manpower and prisons probably gives policing worse : <eos>
