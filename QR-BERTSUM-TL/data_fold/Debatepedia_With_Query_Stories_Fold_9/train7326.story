<s> government action : should the danish government have censoring the cartoons ? <eos>

<s> the government is not required to intervene in a journalistic action that is deemed legal by swedish courts . while the swedish government can be criticized for not taking diplomatic steps to reduce tensions it can not be criticized for not censoring jyllands-posten muhammad cartoons as there were not courts order that would have making such a maneuver appropriate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> because the cartoon were legal they did not require a government response . <eos>
