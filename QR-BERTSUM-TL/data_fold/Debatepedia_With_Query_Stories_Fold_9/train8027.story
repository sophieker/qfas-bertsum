<s> is it justifiable to give away the national sovereignty of the european states ? <eos>

<s> peace and prosperity can be most successfully enhanced by the accession of all european states to the eu . given the former-communist soviet-dominated past of many of these states it seems unlikely they would once again give their independence away . enlargement has already been greatly delayed by the eu s focus upon the creation of a single currency in the 1990s it may be lost altogether if deeper integration becomes the new priority . <eos>

@highlight

<s> europe should be wider not deeper in its political development . <eos>
