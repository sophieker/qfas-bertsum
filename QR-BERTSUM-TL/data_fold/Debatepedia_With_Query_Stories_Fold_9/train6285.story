<s> tradition : should promotion of the traditional nuclear family be avoided ? <eos>

<s> of all families in australia # % of them are single parent families . few will fully establish a child 's potential . over # # australian marriages will end in divorce few of these will be families . so it is wrong to promote the nuclear family when it is failing so badly and it is wrong to hold-out on gay adoption in favor of the nuclear family for the same reason . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear families are failing ; can hardly be held up against gay adoption . <eos>
