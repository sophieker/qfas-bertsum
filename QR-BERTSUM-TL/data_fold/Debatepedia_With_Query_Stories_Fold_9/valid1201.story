<s> individual liberty : should persons be at freedom to use marijuana ? <eos>

<s> the notions that individuals should be free to make the choice to consume marijuana is predicated on the notions that they are fully informed of the costs and are in a position of detached judgement . the problem with this assumption is that those individuals growing up in for instance ghettos where marijuana is widespread social pressure to consume is high and few information is available regarding the costs . in addition an individual may be illiterate or lack sufficient recourse to uncovering the costs . is it fair to that individual to expect that they can make a sound judgement ? no . the guidance of marijuana 's `` illegal '' priority is an importance barrier and red flag to such individuals . <eos>

@highlight

<s> some are `` pressured '' into cannabis consumption without a `` choice '' . <eos>
