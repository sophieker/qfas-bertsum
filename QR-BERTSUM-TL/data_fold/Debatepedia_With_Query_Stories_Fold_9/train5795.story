<s> protecting smokers : should governments restricting smoking to protecting smokers ? <eos>

<s> while a government has a responsibility to protect its population it also has a responsibility to defend their liberty of choice . the law steps in to prevent citizens causing harm to others whether deliberately or accidentally . although it should not stop them taking risks themselves - for example dangerous sports such as rock-climbing parachute or motor-racing are legal . it is also legal to indulge in other health-threatening activities such as eat lots of fatty food taking no exercise and drinking too much alcohol . banning smoking would be an unmerited intrusion into personal freedom .
