<s> public opinions towards the eu among current members ranges from watered-down to somewhat hostile . there is a risk that expansion could turn this lack of excitement into active animosity as citizens see their tax-euros go east and poor job-seekers flooding west while aid to their own depressed regions is cut destabilising the eu and endangering the benefits it has brought over several decades . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public opinion runs against the european union . <eos>
