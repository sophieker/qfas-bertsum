<s> public opinion : do publics support church policy ? <eos>

<s> claire short the uk s minister for international development - `` the catholic church ... opposes contraception but most catholics in the world use it so the catholic church is stuck and wrong on these questions . but lots and lots of catholics ignore the catholic church s teaching including lots of good priests and nuns who are in favor of condoms being made available . '' the catholic church s survival depends on whether it can remain credible on a host of issues such as married priests and gay bishops . [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> few support catholic condom policy undermining church legitimacy <eos>
