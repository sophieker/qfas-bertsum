<s> economics : is the wars on drugs economically sound ? <eos>

<s> `` how to stop the drug wars . '' the economist . mar # th # : `` the war on drugs has been a disaster creating failed states in the developing world even as addiction has flourished in the rich world . by any prudent measures this # -year struggle has been illiberal murderous and pointless . that is why the economists continue to believe that the least bad policy is to legalise drugs . 'least bad ' does not think good . legalisation though clearly better for producer nations would bring ( different ) risks to consumer countries . as we outline below many vulnerable drug-takers would suffer . but in our view more would gain . '' <eos>

<s> legalize drugs is the least bad options <eos>
