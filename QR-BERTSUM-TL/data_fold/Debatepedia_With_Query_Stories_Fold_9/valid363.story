<s> party system : is the electoral college system unfair to third parties ? <eos>

<s> alternative election methods such as approval voting condorcet voting and even instant runoff voting can not be properly implemented at the presidential level if the electoral college remains in place . this is unfortunate given that these methods are a marked improvement on the current systems . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the electoral college stands in the way of election reform <eos>
