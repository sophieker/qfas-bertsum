<s> global warming : can iron fertilization help significantly combat global warming ? <eos>

<s> there is a good chance that global warming is irreversible . global warming is already occurring and there are no plans to reduce greenhouse gases that are already in the atmosphere . greenhouse gas levels will continue to rise despite reductions in new emissions . geoengineering therefore is the likely last resort . <eos>

@highlight

<s> irreversible climate change makes geoengineering unavoidable . <eos>
