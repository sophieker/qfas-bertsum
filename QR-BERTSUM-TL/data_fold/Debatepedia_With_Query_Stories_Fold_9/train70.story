<s> personality traits : does law school cultivate good personalities ? <eos>

<s> ben paris curriculum director for graduate programs at kaplan education center : `` there 's no one personality profile for successful lawyers . many people think that lawyers have to be super-competitive and argumentative but that just is n't so . if you 're interested in litigation you probably have to be able to deal with confrontations but most lawyers are n't litigators . there 's enough variety in the law profession for many different kinds of people to make a meaningful contribution . '' <eos>

<s> diversity in law fits diversity of personalities <eos>
