<s> individual vs. collective : does the 2nd confer an individual or a collective right to arms ? <eos>

<s> this argument is simply here to remind the reader that no individual right is unfettered and absolute . reasonable regulations can be placed on an individual right to bear arms . this argument can go both ways in making an individual right to bear arms more moderate and subsequently more tolerable to both sides in the debate . <eos>

@highlight

<s> an individual right to bear arms can not be absolute <eos>
