<s> military strength : would the military be strengthened by women in combat ? <eos>

<s> pregnancy is already a problem in the military reducing unit readiness . however if women were to see greater deployment and presence in the armed forces it would only worsen the problem . especially with national guard soldiers who build lives and families at home pregnancy is much more likely to be a problem than with active-duty woman soldiers . likewise it can be a means of avoiding call-up . men have even used this tactic during the vietnam war : unpleasant as the thought may be dick cheney conceived a child the day after the draft was to be expanded to married men without children . when women face active duty call-up or a draft some will do the same .

<s> biological arguments can be enlisted in the case against women in front line combat . <eos>
