<s> lowering the drinking ages allows for young people to slowly drink .the moments they enter university they will be legally able to drink and hence not affect their academic status by engaging in illegally drinking and being reported or even expelled . they will also get used to drinking in a social environment such as a club or bar and not home parties where abuse is more infrequent since it fosters illegally drinking . <eos>

@highlight

<s> acquire drink experiences <eos>
