<s> general : terms statements in supporting and against nuclear energy . <eos>

<s> solar power is more renewable and cleaner . its supply is never-ending unlike that of reactors energy . similarly wind power generates no waste and can sustain our planet for millennia to come . reactors power is not the answer . when there are so many expensive safer cleaner and more sustainable alternatives why the debate ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear energy has a limited supply and is much inferior to solar power . <eos>
