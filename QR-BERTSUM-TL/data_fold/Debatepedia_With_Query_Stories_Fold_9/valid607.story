<s> religion : does homosexuality check out on religious grounds ? <eos>

<s> the economist `` the case for gay marriage '' # / # / # - `` it is no business of the state to impose a religious choice . indeed in america the constitutional expressly ban the involvement of the state in religious matters so it would be particularly outrageous if the constitutional were now to be used for religious ends [ that aim to bans gay marriage ] . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> biblical passages that are claiming to condemn homosexuality are being misinterpreted . <eos>
