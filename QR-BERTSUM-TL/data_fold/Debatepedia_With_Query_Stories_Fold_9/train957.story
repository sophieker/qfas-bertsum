<s> torture : are enhanced interrogation techniques legal or are they torture ? <eos>

<s> the bush administration told the cia in # that its interrogators working abroad would not violate us prohibitions against torture if their methods avoided inflicting `` severe pain and suffering '' . the main reason for this is that prisoners can tolerate a little bit of discomfort and even pain but severe pain and suffering can have the effect of lasting bodily or psychological damage . enhanced interrogations succeed at allowing interogators to inflict some discomfort and low-level pain - waterboarding slapping on the belly sensory bombardment prolonged isolation all qualify as such - in order to succeed in obtaining critical national security intelligence while avoiding the higher level `` severe pain and suffering '' that could be called `` torture '' .

<s> enhanced interrogations do n't inflict severe pain/suffering ( not torture ) . <eos>
