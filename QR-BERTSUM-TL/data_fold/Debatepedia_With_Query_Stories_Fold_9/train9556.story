<s> china/india : should chinese and india be held to lower emissions standards ? <eos>

<s> many developed countries nefariously see emissions standards as a means to constrain china and india 's rapid development and to minimize the effect of this new competition on their own economies . the world needs to be aware of this conflict of interests when interpreting the arguments going from developed countries to holding china and india to equal standards . <eos>

@highlight

<s> developed states are exploiting standards to constraining india/china . <eos>
