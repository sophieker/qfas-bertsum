<s> commercial : is surrogacy likely to be commercialized ? is this exploitative ? <eos>

<s> even if charges are standardized the high level of such a fee will still ensure that the rich are more likely to benefit than the poor as they are more likely to be able to afford the cost . no case of parenthood should simply be decided by financial factors . <eos>

@highlight

<s> commercialize surrogacy will benefit the rich more than the poor . <eos>
