<s> is the conscription financially favourable ? <eos>

<s> `` in a very large war ( such as world war ii ) raising a large enough volunteer military would require dramatic decreases in taxes or budget deficits . in such cases conscription can have lower negative impact than the impact of these higher taxes and possibly be more equitable ( higher taxes would penalize those out of services too more than those in service ) . research into fiscal impacts of conscription in world war ii suggest a volunteer army raising to the same size would have had worse economic impact in terms of economic growth . '' ( by wiki the free encyclopedia ) <eos>

<s> possible better economy impacts during wars . <eos>
