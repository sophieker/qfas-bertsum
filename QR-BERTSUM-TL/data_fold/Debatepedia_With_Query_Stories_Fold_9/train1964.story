<s> traditional methods : are traditional interrogation methods insufficient ? <eos>

<s> interrogator ali soufan said in an april # op-ed article in the new york times : `` it is inaccurate [ ... ] to say that abu zubaydah had been uncooperative [ and that enhanced interrogation techniques supplies interrogators with previously unobtainable information ] . along with another f.b.i . agent and with several c.i.a . officers present i questioned him from march to june # before the harsh techniques were introduced later in august . under traditional interrogation methods he provided us with important actionable intelligence . '' [ # ] <eos>

@highlight

<s> the same info can be obtained by traditional interrogations <eos>
