<s> local effects : do local populations benefit ? <eos>

<s> foreign firms gain the most from `` ecotourism '' . eco-tourism firms are not popping up locally but are typically coming from developed countries to poorer countries to take advantage of the opportunities to profit . this inevitably leads to many instances of abuse in which the majority of profits go abroad while local wages are pushing down . <eos>

@highlight

<s> locally communities benefit from ecotourism are minimal <eos>
