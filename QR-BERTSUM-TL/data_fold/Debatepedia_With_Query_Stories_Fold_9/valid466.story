<s> clone : is cloning fair to cloning humans ? <eos>

<s> if clones are treatment poorly by society they will lead less happy lives as others . if they are treatment well they will likely lead equally happy lives as normally people . because their happiness will depend largely on how we receiving them we need only adjust our attitude to be more receptive . banning cloning because we will mistreat them is not fair ; it punish clones for our failures . <eos>

@highlight

<s> clones ' quality-of-life depend on how they are received/treated <eos>
