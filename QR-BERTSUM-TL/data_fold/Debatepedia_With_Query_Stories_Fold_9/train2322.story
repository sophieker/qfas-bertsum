<s> information : do military recruiters provide valuable info ? <eos>

<s> recruiters should not minimise the risks of a military career but the armed forces do have a good story to tell and they should not be prevented from doing so . there really are great opportunities for keen talented young people in the military and almost all soldiers etc . find it a very satisfying life . and compared with the past soldiers today are much better looked after in terms of physical medical and psychological wellbeing . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the military has a compelling story to tell to youth . <eos>
