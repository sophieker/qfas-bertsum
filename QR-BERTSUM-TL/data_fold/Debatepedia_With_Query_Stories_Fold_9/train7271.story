<s> it would simply lead to the physical impregnation of the surrogates by the would-be father rather than a clean surgery procedure that avoided the emotional problems caused by an actual sexuality act between the surrogates and the would-be father . <eos>

@highlight

<s> on a practical note no law against insemination could be enforced properly . <eos>
