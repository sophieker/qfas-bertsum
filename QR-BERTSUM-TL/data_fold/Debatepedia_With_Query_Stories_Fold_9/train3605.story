<s> dependency culture - does making the unemployed work for their money break the dependency culture ? <eos>

<s> no one voluntarily seeks to live on the very low income provided by state benefits instead people become unemployed through no fault of their own ; workfare stigmatises them as lazy and needing to be forced into work by state coercion . the schemes ignore the talents and ambitions of those involved typically using them for menial tasks and manual labour that teach them no useful skills .

@highlight

<s> people would actually rather not be unemployed and dependent on the state : <eos>
