<s> tourism and recreation : should tourism and recreation activities in antarctica be minimized ? <eos>

<s> antarctica should be for all of humanity not just for an elite few researchers who seek to deny others access while simultaneously demanding huge sums of money for their research projects . revenues from tourism could in any case be taxed in order to offset the cost of scientific research . tourism could also promote environmental aims as it would educate visitors about the significance of antarctica and so help to influence environmental policy in many countries around the world . the international association of antarctica tour operators operates a strict code of practice to prevent damaging to the environment . <eos>

@highlight

<s> tourism should be greatly expanding to allow as those people as possibility to visit this unique environment : <eos>
