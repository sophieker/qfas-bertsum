<s> soldiers : would an early withdrawal honor us soldiers ? <eos>

<s> as some people have put it `` supporting the troops means withdrawing them '' . [ # ] the general logic of this is that civilian leaders have a duty to use troops responsibly . but if we assume that iraq has become a war without ends and mission then keeping troops there would be considered irresponsible dishonoring the troops as opposed to honoring or supporting them . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us leaders should not honor dead soldiers by keeping live ones in harms way <eos>
