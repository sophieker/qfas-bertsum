<s> politics : is healthcare care reform too political ? <eos>

<s> chris cost . `` democrats risks another jacksonian moment . '' real clear politics . december # # : `` it stinks of politics . why is there such a rush to pass this bill now ? it 's because the president of the united states recognizes that it is hurting his numbers and he wants it off the agenda . it might not be ready to be passed . in fact it 's obviously not ready ! yet that does n't matter . the president wants this out of the ways by his state of the union address . this is nakedly self-interested politics calculation by the president - nothing more and nothing less .
