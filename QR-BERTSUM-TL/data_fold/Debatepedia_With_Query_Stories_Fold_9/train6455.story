<s> individualism <eos>

<s> republicans often bash government and celebrate the individual over government as if we do n't live in a democracy where government is of by and for the people . in a democracy the government is not an oppressive monolithic figure . instead it is composed of elected officials and is therefore controlled and directed by the will of the people . to bash government is therefore to bash the citizens behind it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> reps by govt but forget it is of by for the people . <eos>
