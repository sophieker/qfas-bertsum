<s> rules : do the rules allow for seating delegates after they 've been stripped ? <eos>

<s> obama and clinton agreed with each other that they would not campaign in either florida or michigan . they agreed with each other on this point because they both recognized that it would not count and subsequently that any effort by one or the other candidate to campaign in these states and stake claim to the results could be unfair would be wasteful and would likely undermine the decision of the dnc . they should stick to this agreement to not count the results of the two states . <eos>
