<s> poverty : does progressive taxation help the poor ? <eos>

<s> this is because the lowest tax band will apply to profit beneath an initial threshold . thus the less one earns the higher percentage of one s pay is not taxable . the cost of basic survival needs is by definition a larger proportion of a lower earner 's income and thus a certain block at the bottom of each income may be tax free altogether to allow for these needs . this protection for the poorest is important because most countries also operate customs tariffs and sales taxes which tend to hit the poor more than the rich in term of the proportion of their income going in indirect taxation ; progressive directly tax redresses the balance . <eos>
