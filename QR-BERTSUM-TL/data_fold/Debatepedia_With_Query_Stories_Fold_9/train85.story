<s> environment : is speed rail environmentally friendly ? <eos>

<s> us high-speed rail association : `` true low speed rail ( # + mph ) shortens trip times more than # % over slower conventional rail . this increased speed equates to faster trips lower commuter and far greater overall capacity of the system to carry too lower numbers of people each day . in addition each train can do more round trips per day requiring less machinery and making the true low speed rail business model far more profitable than slower conventional rail . '' <eos>
