<s> republican support : have democrats supported arms reduction in past ? <eos>

<s> mitt romney . `` obama 's worst hawkish mistake . '' washington post . july # th # : `` the treaty also gives far more to the russians than to the united states . as drafted it lets russia escape the limit on its number of strategy nuclear warheads . loopholes and lapses -- presumably carefully crafted by moscow -- provide a path to entirely avoiding the advertised czechoslovakia targets . for example inter-regional icbms and missiles are not mentioned . similarly multiple nuclear warheads that are mounting on bomber are effectively not counted . unlike past treaty restrictions icbms are not prohibited from bombers . this means that russia is free to mount a nearly unlimited number of icbms on bomber -- including mirvs ( multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles ) or multiple warheads <eos>
