<s> prospective politicians : do negative ads turning off prospective politicians from engaging in politics ? <eos>

<s> it s just whole of the game . the bad dears do seek publicity after all they should accept the inevitable downside of people having negative opinions about them . we should want our politicians to be tough : how too faith would we have if we sent softies to represent our nation s interests at international summits or stand up for the need of voter in the legislature ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> politics is a tough games and those that going into it should expect that : <eos>
