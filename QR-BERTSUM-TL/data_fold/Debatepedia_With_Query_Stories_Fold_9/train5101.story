<s> economics : are education vouchers cost-effective efficient ? <eos>

<s> education does not fit well into a fungible supply/demand system . the main fact is that the supply of schools can not adjusting quickly to year-to-year changes in demand . schools can not be built overnight or within even a single year . and schools can not rapidly adjusting their budgets because demand rises and falls dramatically from one year to the next via schools vouchers . schools are rather long-term investments for long-term demographic trends with the objective of supplying the public with a stability public good - education . this stability supply of education should not be subjecting to the whims of shifts in year-to-year demand . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public school are a public good ; should not be subjecting to market . <eos>
