<s> morality : is child labour immoral ? would the ban ameliorate the moral issue ? <eos>

<s> exporters owners of factories multinational companies and other affluent actors benefit from child labour as they are - mostly thanks to inadequate or non-existent legislation - free to exploiting children in poor countries . it ruined the childhood and future development of these young labourers which is inconsistency with our `` western '' values conventions on the rights of the child etc . <eos>

@highlight

<s> child labor equals exploitation . <eos>
