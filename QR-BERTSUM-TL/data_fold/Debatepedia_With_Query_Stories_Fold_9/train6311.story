<s> teaching the controversy : should the controversy be taught in schools ? <eos>

<s> certainly it sounds reasonable that creationism should taught in public schools in the context of it being a cultural/religious perspective ? who could argue with this ? many non believers would argue that creationism and bible are wonderful literary works of fiction and so yes they should be taught . unfortunately those that uphold creationism as true can not be satisfied with this because their doctrine drives them to require it to be taught as the truth . this is what many creationists are calling for in school systems . they frequently call for individuals classes to be created that teach `` creationism science '' as truth . <eos>

@highlight

<s> attempts to teach the creationism-evolution controversy to students are disingenuous promotions of activist christians . <eos>
