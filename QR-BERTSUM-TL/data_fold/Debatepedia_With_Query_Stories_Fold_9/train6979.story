<s> are the requirements of what you can taking on-board aircraft too strict ? <eos>

<s> many people when flying now have to abide by many restrictions . they are a big hassle and are annoying to the public . things like not being permitted to take more than # ml of fluids even if a # ml bottle is nearly empty ( that happened to me ) and if you take baby foods you are asked to eat it to ensure it does not contain an explosive device . it is these kinds of things that annoy people and is unnecessary . # . # % of people are not terrorists and yet everyone is treated as a suspect . <eos>
