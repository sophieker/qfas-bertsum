<s> renewable : is hydropower a `` renewable '' resource ? <eos>

<s> however hydropower sites are capable of providing heat for many decade eventually specific locations may cool down . it is likely that in these locations the system was designed too large for the sites since there is only so much energy that can be stored and replenished in a given volumes of earth . some interpret this as meaning a specific hydropower location can undergo depletion and question whether hydropower energy is truly renewable . <eos>

<s> geothermal site can cool down over when so are not `` renewable '' . <eos>
