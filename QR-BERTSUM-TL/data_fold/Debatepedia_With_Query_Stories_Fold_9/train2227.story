<s> - fair 's reason # for opposing a guest worker program - `` everyone acknowledges that we need to improve our job skills level as a nation if we are to maintain a competitive edge in the global # st century economy . the guest worker proposals favored by the bush administration and others would vastly increase our pool of low-skill workers . '' <eos>

<s> `` low-skilled labor is not compatible with america s # st century economic objectives . '' <eos>
