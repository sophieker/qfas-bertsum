<s> china/india outsourcing : are exemptions justification in context of outsourcing ? <eos>

<s> by holding developed countries to a greater obligations to fight global warming and by exempting chinese and india from certain emission requirements developed countries will be putting at an economic and job-market disadvantage . it will be even more possibly that jobs are outsourced to chinese and india leaving the middle class of developed countries suffering . <eos>

@highlight

<s> emission exemption for perfect-every-time will inflate outsourcing to them <eos>
