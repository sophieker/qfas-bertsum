<s> socialized medicine : can a public option avoid become `` socialized medicine '' ? <eos>

<s> there is no fact to believe that the intentions of those that are advocated for a public option are bent on destroying the insurance industry and creating a single-payer system . it is true that there are many advocates of a pure single-payer system but there are just as many advocates of a hybrids system . those that propose such a hybrids - through a public option - should be taking on their phrase rather of called liars with a hidden agenda . <eos>

@highlight

<s> efforts to creating a private-public insurance hybrid are in good faith . <eos>
