<s> risks : are gm foods a health risk ? <eos>

<s> almost all foods have been genetically modified in the sense that they are the result of breeding between plants and species . it is wrong therefore to label foods that have been genetically modified with more modern techniques as the only `` genetically modified '' foods on the shelf when in truth almost all the foods have been modified in a similar way . <eos>

@highlight

<s> labeling ignores that all foods are genetically modified . <eos>
