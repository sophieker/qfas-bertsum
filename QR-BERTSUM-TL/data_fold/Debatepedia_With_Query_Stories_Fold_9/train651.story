<s> fundamentalism : is muslim extremism rising around the world ? <eos>

<s> the terrorists branches of such group ( such as al-qaeda ) and the too talked of jihad ( holy war ) are absolutely antithetical to democratic values . islamic terrorism is different from that of terrorists who fight for nationalist causes : islamic terrorism is motivated by religious zeal rather than a will for political change and as such can not be seen as a product of a failing political system . <eos>

@highlight

<s> islamic fundamentalist groups are grow in popularity in part as a reaction to the extension of westernization via globalisation . <eos>
