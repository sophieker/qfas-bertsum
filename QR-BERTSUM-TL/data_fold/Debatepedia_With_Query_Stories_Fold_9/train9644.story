<s> crime : does gangsta hip-hop provoke criminality ? <eos>

<s> gangsta rap is a way for artists to not only capitalize on such a stereotypical image to profit from a journalists industry that was already exploiting african-american stereotypes but also to turn such stereotypes into camp and pastiche a postmodern comment on the nature reception and circulation of journalists images . gangsta rap gives into this persistent and overblown image of african-american females but also goes a step further and intensifies the stereotypes to ridiculous extremes filling videos with over-muscled shirtless artists profanity a bevy of scantily clad and sexually offered women fetishized firearms and an abundance of markers signifying america luxury ( champagne expensive cars mansions jewelry and overspending ) . <eos>

@highlight
