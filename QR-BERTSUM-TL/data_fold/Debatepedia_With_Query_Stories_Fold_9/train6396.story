<s> fairness : is performance-enhancing drug-use unfair in sports ? <eos>

<s> performance-enhancing drugs should be acceptable . it is not consistent to exclude for the theirs of preserving the purity of a sports as the argument goes . if the purity of a sports is based on a historical standard some difficulties arise . there were no highly advanced weight room training facilities and training program in the original eras of baseball in the # th century . the modern existence of these facilities would break-down the criteria that there must be a fair historical standard . <eos>

@highlight

<s> steroids drug are consistent with historical trends . <eos>
