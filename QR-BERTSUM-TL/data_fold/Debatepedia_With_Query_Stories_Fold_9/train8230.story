<s> security : do nuclear weapons make the world less secure ? <eos>

<s> of course not . keeping nukes make the world more secure . nukes make great leverage . that 's why saddam hussein kim-jong-il ahmademijad and countless others could n't press the red button themselves . nukes make war virtually impossible since war means firing of nukes which means a huge blow ! ( all dying including the aggressor . ) nukes make great leverage and also act ( in a way ) like an global unlawful police . <eos>

@highlight

<s> us nuclear weapons help discourage and constrain russia <eos>
