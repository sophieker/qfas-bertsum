<s> energy source : are oil sands a good/competitive energy source ? <eos>

<s> natural gas is considered to be the rising energy star of the 21st century . oil sands will have a hard time competing with this . natural gas is cheaper more abundant and is much cleaner . that it is cleaner will become particularly important as countries place a price on carbon . <eos>
