<s> judiciary overload : would the legalization of marijuana relieve straining courts ? <eos>

<s> many marijuana offenders are not convicted of a crime . this means that most of the money being put into laws enforcement to battle marijuana results in no convictions . it is estimated that $ # . # billion is spent each year policing marijuana crime but most of these crime lead to no conviction . therefor millions of dollars are threw into a system that typically makes no difference in the issue of marijuana ; all the while putting the government deep into financial debt . by legalizing marijuana the tax that can be put into place would possibly be able to bring in an estimated $ # billion accordance to offered california legislation . <eos>
