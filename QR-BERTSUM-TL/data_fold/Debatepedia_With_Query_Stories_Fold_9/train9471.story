<s> compassion : does capital punishment demonstrate compassion and decency ? <eos>

<s> pro death penalty webpage - `` death can actually be a peaceful and spiritually enlightening experience . victims rights activist group 'justice for all ' presents an excellent example of my meaning below : 'the movie dead man walking demonstrates a very good example of how just punishment and jesus ' message of love and redemption can work together : had rapist/murderer matthew poncelet not been properly sentenced to death by the civil authority he would not have met sister prejean he would not have taken responsibility for his crimes and he would not have reconciled with god . had poncelet never been caught or had he only been given a prison sentence his character makes it very clear that those elements would not have come together . <eos>
