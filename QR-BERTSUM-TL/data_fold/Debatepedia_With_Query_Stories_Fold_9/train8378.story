<s> choice : do charter schools offer beneficial choices to parents/students ? <eos>

<s> larry kuehn . `` ten problems with charter schools '' . british columbia teachers ' federation . # - `` the concern of most parents can be addressing by the current system . many program options are currently offered in public schools and schools are increasingly open to program options . particular languages areas of focus such as the arts and gift needs are already met by program within the public schools . this approach better serves the public good than setting up what are often basically private schools with full public funding . parent advisory committees mandated in the school act provide an opportunity for parents to provide input into the school policies .
