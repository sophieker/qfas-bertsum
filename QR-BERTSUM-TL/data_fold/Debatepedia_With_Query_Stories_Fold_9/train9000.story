<s> economy : would the universally languages be beneficial economically ? <eos>

<s> every benefits they with some sacrifices . if we do n't carry out the `` global language '' just for the sake of the anthropologists and language teachers the world will never be able to develop . also great anthropologists and great language teachers are expected to be rather intelligent people they would arguably adapt quickly to some other activities . <eos>

@highlight

<s> universally language would remove costs of translation services . <eos>
