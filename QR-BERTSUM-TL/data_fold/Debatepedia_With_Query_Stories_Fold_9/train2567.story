<s> pricing : can nationalization solve problem of pricing bad assets ? <eos>

<s> `` another argument is that banks dodgy assets are hard to value making it impossible to know how much capital they need and probably very expensive to provide it . true again . but nationalization doesn t make these problems disappear . [ ... ] if the government takes over a bank the taxpayers tacitly acquire its assets thereby inheriting all the uncertainties over valuation . and if a bank has negative net worth when it is nationalized who do you think fills the hole ? '' <eos>
