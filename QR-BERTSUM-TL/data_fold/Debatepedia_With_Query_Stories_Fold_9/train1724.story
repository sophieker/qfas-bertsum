<s> social : are dioxide emissions trading systems socially beneficial fair ? <eos>

<s> emissions trading does not make the environment and emissions into property and places all power in the hands of the markets . rather government is in charge of establishing the system through democracy processes and settings `` caps '' . the public therefore are in charge of market-based systems . it is wrong therefore to argue that the environment is being turned into public property and that too too power is being put into the hands of public companies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> emission trading involve adequate democratic control <eos>
