<s> free markets : is it best to leave journalism to the markets ? <eos>

<s> declan mccullagh . `` should you be taxed to subsidize 'the new york times ' ? '' . cnet . september 28 2007 - `` i 'm not sure what 's going to happen to newspapers in their current form but i am optimistic about the future of journalism . my own employer cnet networks has found a way to make money by publishing news and reviews without collecting taxpayer handouts . if readers ( or viewers ) continue to want original reporting and i believe they will news organizations will find a way to meet that market demand . without a taxpayer bailout newspapers may not look exactly like they do today but journalism itself will remain alive and well .

<s> journalism can monetize demand without government bailout <eos>
