<s> homosexuals : do gays and lesbians need hate crime protections ? <eos>

<s> this is particularly true in regard to the expression of religious opposition to homosexuality in which a preacher 's public statements against homosexuality might be interpreted as incitements to violence against homosexuals . while it is important to consider whether homosexuals need protections it is also necessary to consider the costs of these laws to religious free speech . <eos>

@highlight

<s> hate crime laws violate religious free speech <eos>
