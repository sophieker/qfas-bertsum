<s> purpose of marriage : is it valuable ? <eos>

<s> what is most important is the relationship between the two parents and their attitudes and relationships individually and together with the child . this is completely uncorrelated with marriage . what s more a stable co-habitation situation is far better for a child than an unhappy marriage . the heartache pain stress and psychological disturbance of a child when their parents break up is not due to the breakdown of marriage but the breakdown of a relationship . <eos>

@highlight

<s> it is fallacious to presume that marriage as an institution is what provides a stable home environment for a child . <eos>
