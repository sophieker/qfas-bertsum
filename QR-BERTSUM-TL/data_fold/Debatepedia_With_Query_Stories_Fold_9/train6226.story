<s> rights : is it important to enshrine principles in a bills of rights ? <eos>

<s> any society always assumes that it s position on matters is the most sensible most rational and ultimately best . in fact societies throughout history have had hugely differing expectations of life depending on their religion political and cultural environment . for example a thousand years ago women were considered inferior to men and this was a viewpoint which the vast majority of women sharing as they had been brought up to believe in it . the problem occurs when one society with its own oddball views attempts to formulate a legal document that will bind future generations . for example the american bill of rights was considered revolutionary and foresighted in its when but now rights such as the right to bear arms <eos>

<s> a bill of rights could enshrine principles that will changing in the future . <eos>
