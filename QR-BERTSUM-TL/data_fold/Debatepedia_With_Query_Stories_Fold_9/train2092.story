<s> are guns great for self-defense ? <eos>

<s> there is a global increase in gun owners even in countries which did not traditionally think of themselves as having a large crimes gun culture e.g . great britain . this increases the risks to frontline cops officers of being the victims of gun crime . cops officers should have a right to protect themselves . fewer officers may die on duty if they were better can to protect themselves . arming the cops is essentially a matter of self-defence rather than being actively involved in regular firearms incidents . this is shown by the fact that most routinely armed cops ever fire their weapon on active duty in their whole career . <eos>

@highlight

<s> routinely arming cops officers enables them to defend themselves . <eos>
