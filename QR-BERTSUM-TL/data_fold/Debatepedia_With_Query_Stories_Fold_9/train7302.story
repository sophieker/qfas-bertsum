<s> legality : is the blockade law under international law ? <eos>

<s> after israel 's unilateral disengaged plans from the hamas strip israel no longer occupied hamas with troops . but israel has retained control over gaza 's no-fly and coastline and over its own border with the territory . egypt has control of its border with hamas ( except for the tunnels ) . israel and egypt also control the flow of goods in and out . israel controls fuel imports to hamas and also controls the majority of electricity used in hamas ( approximately # % ) which it supply from the israeli electrical grid . so while israel may not have troops in hamas any more it has too much control over too many areas of life there . it is effectively an occupier and its blockade should be seeing in this <eos>

@highlight

<s> israel controls too much of gaza ; it is an occupier . <eos>
