<s> blame : are developed states more to blame for climate change so more obligated ? <eos>

<s> developed nations did not always know that they were causing global warming by burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere . this knowledge only began to form in the # s and # s over a century after the industrial revolution had begun . it is inappropriate therefore to hold developed nations morally accountable for starting the industrial revolution and causing global warming ; they knew not what they were doing . and once developed economies were dependent on fossil fuels it was not possible for them to immediately act on their knowledge and stop using fossil fuels - particularly when not everyone accepted the science behind global warming . it is therefore wrongheaded to `` blame '' the developed world for global warming and saddle <eos>
