<s> priorities : is adaption a priority requiring greater focus/funding ? <eos>

<s> climate assistance is only necessary when the effects of climate change they to materialize in major ways . jumping the gun and providing assistance before it is needed on the ground will likely result in assistance being spent in unnecessary ways based on speculation about how climate change might occurs instead of on the ways in which it is actually occurring . a better idea would be to wait and see which countries losing the most ( as some poor countries may losing very little and but gain from climate change ) and to focus attention on these regions ( not but imply a whole country ) that are most harmed . <eos>

@highlight

<s> assistance is not yet needed for adapt to warming change . <eos>
