<s> judicial process : do guantanamo courts provide adequate judicial process ? <eos>

<s> prisoners have been detained at guantanamo for long periods without a clear charges being filed and without trial . this is a violation of the international legal principle of habeas corpus . one of the primary problems is that without clear charges and a presentation of evidence against a suspect the suspect can not contest the charges and prove their own innocence . and as a matter of fact numerous detainees have been found innocent but only after excessively long periods with being charged or brought before a court . <eos>

<s> guantanamo violates habeas corpus obstructs proof of innocence <eos>
