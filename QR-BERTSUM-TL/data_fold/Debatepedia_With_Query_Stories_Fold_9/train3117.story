<s> the blockade of gaza wrongfully prevents cement and other building supplies from enter the gaza strip by ship or land . this is based on the idea that these materials could be use to building civilian fortifications . but its effect is far-reaching in undermining legitimate gaza construction efforts especially those necessary in rebuilding infrastructure after the devastating # - # war .
