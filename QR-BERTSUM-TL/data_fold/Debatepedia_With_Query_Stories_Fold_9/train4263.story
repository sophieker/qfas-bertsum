<s> equality : which is good at fostering gender dealt with inequality ? <eos>

<s> it is false to think of capitalism as a zero-sum game in which the only way for the rich to become rich is to taking from the poor . this misreads the process by which a businesses and individual become successful and wealthy which entails an individual and groups within a company create value in the marketplace that other citizen-consumers like and so rewards by buying that service/product . create value in this way takes nothing from anybody else it actually creates value out of nothing and adds it into an economy . part of the result is that the poor or unemployed may now be hired by the businesses and finally if they have merit climb up the ranks of the businesses <eos>

@highlight

<s> businesses do n't take from poor ; they add values and jobs . <eos>
