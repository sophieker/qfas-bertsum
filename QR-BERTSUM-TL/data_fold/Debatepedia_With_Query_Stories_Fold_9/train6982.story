<s> rights : which system better protects individual rights and counters discrimination ? <eos>

<s> why would state recognition of indigenous groups and differences between them necessarily empower these different groups ? might it actually alienate them ? might it weaken them by bringing to the surface historical grievances and pain ? might it create tension and conflict that further weakens them ? while it is certainly possible that multiculturalism can better enable a minority group to communicate with its government it is unclear if it is worth it as compared with these other costs and if it is then ultimately empowering for these groups . <eos>

@highlight

<s> multiculturalism does not help empower minority groups <eos>
