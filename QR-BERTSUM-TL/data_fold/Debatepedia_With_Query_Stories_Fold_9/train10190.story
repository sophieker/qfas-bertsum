<s> contract : was aig obligation by contracts to give bonuses ? <eos>

<s> the citigroup bonuses contracts were certainly invalid when they were signed . but when taxpayers bailing out citigroup circumstances certainly changed . it was no longer simply a contract between citigroup and its employees . suddenly a third party - the taxpayers and their money - were introduced . and taxpayers should not be held liable for these bonuses contracts . actually this changed the terms of the contracts and they should be renegotiated . <eos>
