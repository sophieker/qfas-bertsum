<s> security : does the wall do nothing to improve israel 's security ? <eos>

<s> which could result in a greater number of suicide attack in israel . israelis and palestinians will need to learn to living side by side but building an # metre high wall sends a clear message to palestinians that israel is hostile and unwilling to find a permanent solution that would suit both nations . east jerusalem in certain has been relatively quiet during the second intifida but the wall there will split communities disrupt everyday life and declare that a shared sovereignty solution is no longer possible for the cities both sides claim as their capital . it would be hard to find a good way to radicalise the inhabitants of east jerusalem .

<s> any short terms secure gain will be offset by growing palestinian resentment against israel <eos>
