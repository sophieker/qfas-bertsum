<s> tolerance : should breastfeeding be tolerated ? <eos>

<s> breastfeeding is necessary for a child who is in his mothers lap but the others watching it do not feel as the child . all other people will find themselves looking at the breasts in a feel of the child 's father . so it 's a mans ' privilege to watch his wife breastfeeding . should all people interrupt in his rights ? or should we all be the virtual fathers of the child ? <eos>
