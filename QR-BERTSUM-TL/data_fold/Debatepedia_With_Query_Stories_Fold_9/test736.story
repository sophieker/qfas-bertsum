<s> dignity of life : does condom-use violate the dignity of life ? <eos>

<s> one of the main catholic arguments against abortion is that life begins at conception or when the sperm enters the egg . this argument can work however against the catholic position on contraception . if life begins when the sperm enters the egg contraception can not be seen as taking a newly formed human life ; contraception occurs before life has started . therefore it can not be said to violate the dignity of life as it relates to a fertilized egg or an unborn child . <eos>

@highlight

<s> if life begins at conception contraception can not violate life . <eos>
