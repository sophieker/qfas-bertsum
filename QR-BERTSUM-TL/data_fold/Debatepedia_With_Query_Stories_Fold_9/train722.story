<s> is the conscript financially favourable ? <eos>

<s> `` in a very large war ( such as world war ii ) raising a large much volunteer military would require dramatic decreases in taxes or budget deficits . in such cases conscription can have lower negative impact than the impact of these higher taxes and possibly be more equitable ( higher taxes would penalize those out of service much more than those in service ) . research into fiscal impacts of conscription in world war ii suggest a volunteer troops raised to the same size would have had worse economic impact in terms of economic growth . '' ( by wikipedia the free encyclopedia ) <eos>

@highlight

<s> possibility better economic impact during wars . <eos>
