<s> costs : would withdrawing from iraq significantly aid the us economy ? <eos>

<s> we should be proud that our nations and their armed forces have risen to the challenge of rebuilding iraq and confident that their brave efforts will make the world both safer and freer . it is a shame that other countries have not been willing to share their part of the burden . apart from our moral commitment to the iraqi people and the desirability of spreading freedom it is also in our interest to secure a stable middle east . our free society and open economy depends for its prosperity on international peace and stability so all our futures are threatened if we give in to terrorism in iraq or elsewhere . <eos>

<s> you can not put a price on freedom and security . <eos>
