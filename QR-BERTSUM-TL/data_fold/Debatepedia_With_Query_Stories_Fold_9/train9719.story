<s> practicality : is labeling chevy foods practical ? <eos>

<s> almost all foods are genetically modified in some way either by cross-breeding of species selective harvesting or more contemporary engineering . define only the more contemporary approaches as the gm foods and not the other more ancient methods of genetic engineer runs into difficulties . in addition what about cases in which a single ingredient is genetically modified ? a good example is the corn and feedstock that is consume by cattle . should the resulting meat be considered genetically modified ? the challenge lies in drawings the lines and the lines is possibly to be arbitrary . <eos>

@highlight

<s> defining gm and non-gm foods is almost impossible . <eos>
