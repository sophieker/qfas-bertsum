<s> privacy : does recruitment in schools invade student privacy ? <eos>

<s> us military recruitment in schools has a very sinister side . under the no child left behind act military recruiters collect data on # million students . a huge database contains their personal details including social security numbers email addresses and academic records . the purpose of this is to allow recruiters to pester young people with messages phone calls and home visits . this itself is bad enough but many people think the government should not be trusted with so much personal information . isn t it police states that want to keep files on all their citizens ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> military should not be able to collect info on students . <eos>
