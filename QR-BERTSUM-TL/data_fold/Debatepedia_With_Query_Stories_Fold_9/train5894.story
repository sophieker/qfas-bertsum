<s> environment : is the three gorges dam benefiting the environment ? <eos>

<s> the reservoir of the three gorges dam is similar to other dams fostering algae blooms and elevated levels of phosphate and nitrate pollutants that are damaging to water quality for both the wildlife and for human consumption . because the reservoir is so massive the effect on water quality is going to be on a scale never seen before particularly as tributaries coming off of the # kilometer reservoir are experiencing the ill effects as well . <eos>
