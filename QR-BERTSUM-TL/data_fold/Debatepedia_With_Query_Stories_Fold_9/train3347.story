<s> differentiating responsibilities : do state have a `` common but differentiating responsibility '' ? <eos>

<s> if developed countries are forced to cut emissions and developing countries allowed to increase per capita emissions -- with both meeting in the middle -- the ultimate result is that developing-country-increases cancel out developed-country-reductions . overall emissions could be kept constant and not reduced . in fact because developing countries have larger population meeting in the middle on per capita emissions could result in but higher overall emissions . contraction and convergence while it might be `` fair '' could not help solve the principal issue involved -- global warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> seeking equality of emissions fail to cut overall emissions . <eos>
