<s> value of debate : does allowing debate legitimize genocide denial ? <eos>

<s> proper historians seek to consider findings to reach conclusion rather than working in reverse . genocide deniers refuse to be persuaded by debate . debate therefore does not stop genocide deniers spouting their danger myths : it is required to use criminal penalty to stop them from doing so . <eos>

@highlight

<s> genocide deniers are not persuade by reason ; penalty necessary . <eos>
