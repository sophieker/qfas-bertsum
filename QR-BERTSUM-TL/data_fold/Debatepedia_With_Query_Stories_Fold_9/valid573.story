<s> present : does facebook contributing or distract from the present ? <eos>

<s> `` tweeting '' what you 're doing does not always make you appreciate more what you 're doing . you 'll getting to enjoy what you 're doing when you are with you 're friends or families or a love one and not through tweeting . besides how can people be so sure that what the person tweet is true or not . once a person tweet something it 's out in the public and this could affect the privacy and even the security of a person . it will be disseminate what a person is doing where a person is and the like . plus not all of the topics in twitter are that academic and intellectual ( such as bustin jieber mini lady gaga and such ) . tweets ca n't add more appreciation to <eos>
