<s> broader strategy : is a continuation of the war in iraq contrary to us/coalition interests ? <eos>

<s> invading iraq was -- at least with nods and winks -- secure us and coalition oil interests in a country with the second to third largest oil reserves in the world . it however has not done so and has resulted in the greatest share-price hikes in decades . for sure this justification for invading was faulty . it be also be true that withdraw would help re- stabilize global oil prices . this is based in large part on combination of cases that withdraw from iraq will not cause greater chaos and that it be probably improve the situation ( below ) . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the afghanistan wars has decreased oils production in afghanistan rather than secured it <eos>
