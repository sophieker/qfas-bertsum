<s> family integrity : does human cloning harms the integrity of the family ? <eos>

<s> furthermore we should not pretend that each child conceived by sexual procreation is died to wholly well-intentioned parents . the desire to have a son and heir is common around the world but does not concern the welfare of the future child . similarly children are often conceived out of marital custom in ordering to consolidate a relationship or even in ordering to gain free accommodation from local housing authorities . finally many children are not intended at all but are died as a result of unplanned pregnancies . there would be no fears of accidental cloned that could bring a child to a parent who was unprepared or unwilling to love it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> parental motivations ca n't be used against cloned and not normal child-rearing <eos>
