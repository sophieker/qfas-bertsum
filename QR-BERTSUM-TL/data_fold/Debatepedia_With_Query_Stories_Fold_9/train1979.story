<s> society : does the burqa bans improve society strength ? <eos>

<s> why could society want to condone something that intentionally makes women look bad ? while there are ways of maintaining modesty in dress the burka goes beyond this in an effort to make women look like shapeless faceless blobs . there is no reason for this extreme denigration of the female form . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the burqa and niqab are meant to make women looks unappealing . <eos>
