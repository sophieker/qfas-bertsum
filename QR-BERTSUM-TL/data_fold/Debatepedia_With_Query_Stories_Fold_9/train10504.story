<s> information : does the doctor-patient ensure clients give lawyers the full story ? <eos>

<s> but if a defendant is willing to seeking law advice in the absence of the privileges they will be reluctant to be completely honest with their lawyers for fear that what they say be be used against them later . it is important to realise that but an innocent client be have bad things that he be wish to remains confidential . it is not true that only guilty people will have something to hide . yet to advise a client properly an lawyer must have a complete knowledge of the facts include any bad or damaging facts . this gives the attorney a better understanding of the client s law liabilities and a better idea of what he will need to answer at <eos>

@highlight

<s> without doctor-patient privilege people would not tell their lawyers anything . <eos>
