<s> protect troops : does practicing tortures not undermine the safety of a country 's own troops ? <eos>

<s> - one of the main reasons for international laws regarding the treatment of prisoners of wars is to protect a country 's own troops from mistreatment abroad . if a country performs torture however it becomes impossible to demand that torture not be performed on their own troops . in this way the practice of torture jeopardizes the safety of a country 's own troops . <eos>

@highlight

<s> performing torture takes a country 's troops at risk of being tortured in returns <eos>
