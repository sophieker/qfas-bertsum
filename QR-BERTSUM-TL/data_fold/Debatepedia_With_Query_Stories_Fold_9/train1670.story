'' the new republic . may 8 2000 : `` even if you concede that gay men -- being men -- are in the aggregate less likely to live up to the standards of monogamy and commitment that marriage demands this still suggests a further question : are they less likely than say an insane person ? a straight man with multiple divorces behind him ? a murderer on death row ? a president of the united states ? the truth is these judgments simply can not be fairly made against a whole group of people . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> success rate of gay marriages is an inappropriate criteria <eos>
