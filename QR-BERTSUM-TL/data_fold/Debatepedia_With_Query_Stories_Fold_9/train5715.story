<s> land-use : does the producing of biofuels use reasonable amounts of land ? <eos>

<s> biofuels are basically a ways of harnessing photovoltaic energy ; the energy that is stored in the biofuel which is later converted to biofuel comes from the photovoltaic irradiation . while the fact that this ways directly produces fuel is beneficial ( the fuel can be easily stored ) the overall power conversion efficiency offered by biofuels is fairly low just a small fraction of that offered by e.g . photovoltaics and other technologies . that 's why the areas required to provide a given amount of energy from biofuels are order ( s ) of magnitude larger than those required by e.g . photovoltaics . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there are more efficient way how to harnesses solar energy than biofuels . <eos>
