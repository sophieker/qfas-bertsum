<s> the pro and un arguments : <eos>

<s> nobody in quran it is mentioned that to attain webmd or eternal one needs to kill in the name of allah . although it is mentioned that if someone enters your territory driven by undue intentions then you must fight for your religion and your people . this may be true for any other religion as but i.e.to fight for the right cause for your people . this is in no way related to violence . misinterpretation of this logic has led to misguiding and misleading of numerous young muslims to the paths of terrorism and violence . <eos>

@highlight

<s> muslim world has had no more violent than other religions . <eos>
