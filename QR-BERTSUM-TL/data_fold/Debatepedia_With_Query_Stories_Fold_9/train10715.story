<s> nature : are zoo unnaturally and subsequently immoral ? <eos>

<s> many zoos do not lock animals up in cages . a lot of them have small areas that animals can play in and a lot is done to ensure the animals are happy . the animals ' housings are making to be similar to the animals ' natural habitats and care is taking to ensure natural wildlife is throughout most enclosures . in zoos that strive to do this it is ok to not have animals in their natural environment . however in some zoos which lock their animals in cages and give them nothing to do it is not okay . <eos>

@highlight

<s> many zoos have small realistic enclosures . <eos>
