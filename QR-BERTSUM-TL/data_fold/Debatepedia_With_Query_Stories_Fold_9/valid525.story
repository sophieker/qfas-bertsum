<s> cigarettes ads : should smokers advertisements be limited or banned ? <eos>

<s> there is no good evidence that either of these measures would have an impact on the rate of tobacco consumption . cigarette companies claim that advertisements are merely to convince people to switch brands not to start smoking in the first place . people start smoking through peer pressures - indeed the more of a 'forbidden fruit ' cigarettes become the more appealing they will be to adolescents . as for health warnings if the knowledge that cigarettes have serious health risk deterred people from smoking then no-one would smoking any more . people start and continue to smoking in the full knowledge of the health risks .

@highlight

<s> advertisements do not forces people to smoke . <eos>
