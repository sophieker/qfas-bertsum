<s> benefiting workers ? - does a ceiling on weekly work hours benefit workers ? <eos>

<s> at the moment many workers feeling pressure and indeed may well be pressured to work longer hours or more days than they want to because their job security and livelihoods can depend on their unwillingness to meet managerial demands . they could welcome a reduced working week but are in a poor position but to ask for it . many workers ( especially unskilled or semi-skilled ones ) lack negotiating power with their employer since in the capitalist system they are essentially transferable units of labour . government therefore has a moral legitimacy in acting on workers behalf to protecting their generic interests and the right not to be forced to work long hours is a good example of this .

<s> a maximum working week provides protect for workers . <eos>
