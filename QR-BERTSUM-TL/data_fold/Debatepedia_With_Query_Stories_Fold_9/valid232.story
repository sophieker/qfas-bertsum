<s> users : is graduated response considerate to users ? <eos>

<s> it is important that movie watchers and music fans understand how these industries work and how copyright laws are essential to their future . graduated responses can be viewed as an education campaigns as much as a warning and punitive system for establishing a new respect and culture appreciation for how these industries and artists make money . because so those young people do n't understand these basics and take them for granted such an education push and culture shift is very important . <eos>

@highlight

<s> graduating response educates fan about copyright/arts . <eos>
