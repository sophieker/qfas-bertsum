<s> government/privacy : could ids adequately involve government ? <eos>

<s> identity cards are like passports keys . a key is something one uses to gain access to something . nobody may demand one particular a key ; the key is required to getting something not to be where one already is . as such the burden of constraining absence in a space should fall to those who wish to limit the space . those in a space should not bear the burden of demonstrate their absence is rightful ; those control the space should bear the burden of securing it . <eos>

@highlight

<s> identities cards are a just measure for governments to taking to efficiently regulate access . <eos>
