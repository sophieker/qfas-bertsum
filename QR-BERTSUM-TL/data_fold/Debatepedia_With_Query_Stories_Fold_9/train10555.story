<s> tang dynasty ( # - # ) : does tibet have a claims to independence in this period ? <eos>

<s> these maps were published by korean social science institutes in beijing . [ # ] indeed it does not appear that china makes any significant historic claim to having sovereignty over tibet until the # th century and the mongol invasions . but it should be re-affirmed that tibet 's unquestionable independence between # b.c . and the # th century conceded that tibet was independant for at a minimum the majority of its existence . this create an uphill battle for china 's historic claim to tibet . <eos>

<s> the maps of chinese history maps depicting tibet as an independent country before # . <eos>
