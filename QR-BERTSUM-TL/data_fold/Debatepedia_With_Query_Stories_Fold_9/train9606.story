<s> global climate crisis : is photovoltaic shading a reasonable solution ? <eos>

<s> by reducing the amount of sunlight that entering the surroundings solar shading decrease the amount of energy offered to solar energy cells . this is cause for concern because solar energy is a major sources of # -emission power and so a significant solution to the global climate crisis . to diminish this solution is to weakening the fight against global warming . <eos>

@highlight

<s> discontinuing solar shading could result in rapid climate <eos>
