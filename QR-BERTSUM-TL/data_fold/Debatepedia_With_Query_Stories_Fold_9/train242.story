<s> morality : is adult incest generally morally sound or corrupt ? <eos>

<s> the case against incest is based on an application of biblical rules that have bit to do with today s inclusive and tolerate principles . modern citizen must learn to live with people who perform deeds they consider abhorrent but which do not directly harms other individuals . citizen can certainly protest but to ban outright a certain practice on the simple basis of `` immorality '' is unacceptable in modern democracies . <eos>

@highlight

<s> citizens should tolerate `` immorality '' such as incest . <eos>
