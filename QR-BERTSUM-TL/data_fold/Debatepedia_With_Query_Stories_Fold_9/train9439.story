<s> should women be in the draft ? <eos>

<s> women are generally not physically equal to men . on the aggregate women are not as strong as men . putting them on the front lines is of great risk to them and the military . the military requires a wide range of skills and strength often not found in women . it is safer and more logical to only have men in a job like the military as women sometimes can not handle these kinds of jobs . <eos>

@highlight

<s> most miltary jobs require physical work that women are not capable of . <eos>
