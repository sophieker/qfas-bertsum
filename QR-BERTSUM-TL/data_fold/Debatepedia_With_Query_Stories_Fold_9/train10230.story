<s> crime : are on-campus dorms safer than off-campus housing ? <eos>

<s> the more common crimes ( robbery rape liqour laws etc . ) have dramatic statistics in many colleges . these statistics are the reported ones . who knows how many people are n't busted for crimes . in my interview my interviewee said that at many of the parties being busted that she 's been to the cops made them leave and nothing more . no m.i.p 's were given out . if they were to be reported the crime statistics would rise dramatically . campus police are n't aware of everything that goes on . they ca n't watch each dorm room 24/7 . <eos>

@highlight

<s> crimes around on-campus dorms are high though under-reported <eos>
