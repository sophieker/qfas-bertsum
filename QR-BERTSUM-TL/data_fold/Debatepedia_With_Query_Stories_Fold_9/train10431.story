<s> religious liberty : is the prohibition of school prayer consistently religious liberty ? <eos>

<s> the dynamic tension between the free established and free exercise clauses of the first amendment is neither novel nor insoluble . a formal school prayer can not properly be considered as the free exercise of religion . the practice is directed by an ordinance of the local board of education . the staff of the school implement the ordinance . by participating in the prayer the pupils simply obey it . the free exercise clause protects religious liberty and not religious compulsion . in the alternative it might be assumed that banning school prayer impairs to some degree free exercise . but this infringement is exceedingly minor given that the pupil is not precluded from engaging into private or group prayer of her own accord .

<s> prohibiting school prayers is compatible with freedom of religion . <eos>
