<s> farm-culture : is 9-month schooling a function of farm-culture ? <eos>

<s> resistance to change in the case of moving to year-round schooling is justified on the basis of the actual costs of adjusting to change . the adjustment period is challenging for students and teachers alike takes administrative time and effort and so is both emotionally and financially costly . it is not therefore unreasonable to consider change itself as a potential cost in this debate . particularly if all else seems equal between a traditional school and a year-round school it is reasonable to resist year-round schooling on the basis that change is costly . <eos>

<s> changing to year-round schooling has significant costs . <eos>
