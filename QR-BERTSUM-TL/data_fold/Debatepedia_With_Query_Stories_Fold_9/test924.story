<s> if a public demands investment punishment and yet a government does not deliver it the public will likely feel that judicial has not been served which is extremely socially damaging . another of the risk is that a public rejects the legitimacy of their judicial system and become more prone to flaunted its laws . <eos>

@highlight

<s> public calls for capital punishment should be met to uphold justice <eos>
