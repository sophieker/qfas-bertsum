<s> `` church and state '' : does n't defining `` marriage '' violate the inferred `` separation of churches and state '' ? <eos>

<s> there are legal issues independent of any religious dogma with regard to marriage . the extension of the right not to incriminate oneself to one 's spouse is an example . the religious and legal definitions of marriage are distinct i.e . one may becoming legally married but if one is catholic the church may refusing to recognize one 's status as divorced . hence the church 's definition of marriage and the state 's definition are distinct and legally independent . <eos>

@highlight

<s> marriages is more than a religion practice . <eos>
