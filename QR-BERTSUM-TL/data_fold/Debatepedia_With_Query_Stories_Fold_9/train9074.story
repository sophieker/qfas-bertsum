<s> undemocratic ? is the electoral college undemocratic ? <eos>

<s> - the fears of the electoral college surround instances in which the popular vote does not coincide with the electoral college results . but these fears are exaggerated principally because of the rarity of this occurring . this result has really only happened twice in american history first in 1888 with benjamin harrison 's victory of grover cleveland and then with the election of president bush in 2000. the 1824 and 1876 election results in which this occurred can not fairly be counted against the electoral college mainly because the results were directed by voter fraud and partisan factionalism . because it is so rare that the electoral college does not reflect the popular vote it is hard to say that the electoral college is <eos>

<s> rarely has the loser of the us popular vote won the electoral college <eos>
