<s> culture : is bullfighting a culture artistic practice ? <eos>

<s> international movement against bullfights : `` the truth is if a creature suffers then there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffer into consideration . all animals are sentient beings that experience joy happiness fear and pain in the same way that human beings do . we can have no way whatsoever to make them suffer for our `` enjoyment '' . if any torture inflicted to an animal deserves condemning bullfights are the worst kind of torture since they are performed solely in the name of entertainment . we must end the animals ' torture and stop these shows of brutality and violence . it is too small a step from the intentional infliction of pain on an animal to the torture and killing <eos>

@highlight

<s> inflicting pains for the purpose of entertainment is wrong . <eos>
