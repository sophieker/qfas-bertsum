<s> economics : is the three canyons dam benefiting china 's economy ? <eos>

<s> while there certainly are economic benefits from the three canyons dam the economic shock that the dam has causing to over a billion displaced individuals and potentially millions more must also be taking into account . does the slight economic gain for the average chinese person outweigh the severe of the shock to the couple of millions that were displaced and whose livelihoods were destroyed ? <eos>

@highlight

<s> the tgd does not economically benefits the displaced <eos>
