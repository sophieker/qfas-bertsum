<s> is the existence of corporations worse for human rights ? <eos>

<s> when companies were first chartered by monarchs they were designed to bring the monarchs the most profit and power possible . so they were created with a structure that supposed that if they did n't bring sufficient profit they would collapse . this form the basic structure of companies and means that they must pursuing profit at all costs . ( summed up from the begin of `` life inc. '' by douglas rushkoff ) . since companies are forced by their structure to maximize profit and put profits before people they are pathological institutions and are a huge danger to human rights which are meaningless in the quest for profit . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the internal structures of corporations forces them to put profits over people . <eos>
