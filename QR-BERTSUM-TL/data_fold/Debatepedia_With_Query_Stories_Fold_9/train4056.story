<s> gateway drug : is marijuana not a gateway drug ? <eos>

<s> marijuana is considered a `` soft '' drug as compared with `` harder '' drugs such as cocaine heroine and crystal meth . this is because it is than addictive and generally considered than harmful than these other drugs . but the problem is that as a `` soft '' drug marijuana acts as a stepping stone or `` gateway '' to `` harder '' drugs . having trying marijuana and having been indoctrinated into the world of `` mind-altering '' drugs those are much more possibly to then try harder drugs . the illegality of marijuana creates a barriers before this `` gateway '' . <eos>
