<s> democracy : does nato membership help liberalize countries ? <eos>

<s> . the criteria for nato membership include stability democracy ; civilian control of the armed forces ; a sufficient military capacity to make a tangible contribution to collective secure ; and the absence of active disputes on or within the border of the state . this subsidisation is critical given the indication from the european union at the cologne conference that the majority of these countries will not be permitted to accede to eu membership within the coming decade . nato membership will help these hatching states to help themselves . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the prospect of nato membership encourages democracy reforms <eos>
