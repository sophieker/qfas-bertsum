<s> `` stop year-round school in auburn '' . a report to the alabama city schools board of education . # nov. # - `` of concern to any school system is the low achievement of at-risk students . the number of at-risk students in the acs district is # as cited at pta meetings . there are about # students enroll in the district schools . the advantage of yrs for at-risk students is the possibility that remediation during the intersessions might help . unfortunately this promise has not been fulfilled . as was pointing out at the cary woods pta meeting the suggestion that # weeks of failure can be remedied in one week of intersession is unrealistic .

<s> year-round school is not uniquely useful to low-income students <eos>
