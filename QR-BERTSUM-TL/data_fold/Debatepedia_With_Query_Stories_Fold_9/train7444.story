'' angeles angeles times . april # th # : `` i agree that there 's something awful about the police asking citizens for their 'papers . ' ( there 's nothing particularly awful about asking illegal immigrant for their papers though . ) there 's also something awful about american citizens being physically searched at airports or about irs agents prying into nearly all of your personal-financial transactions or thanks to the passage of pelosi serving as health insurance enforcers . in other words many governments function are unappealing . that 's not in itself an argument against them . the patriot act was awful and necessary .
