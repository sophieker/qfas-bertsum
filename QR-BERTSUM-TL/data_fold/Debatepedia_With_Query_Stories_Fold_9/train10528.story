<s> healthy foods : will a fat tax causes the consumption of healthy foods ? <eos>

<s> if a tax is imposed of fats foods the prices of these foods will go up . law of demand does states the demand for these fats foods will go down but what will happen to the prices of the healthy foods ? imho companies that produce the healthy foods will using this as a reason to increase their prices . with the huge debate over obesity and healthy lifestyles demand for healthy foods will also increase ; meaning the supply for these item will decrease . basic economics still says that the prices thermodynamic will increase . so imposing a fat tax will only make it more expensive to eat : healthy or not . <eos>
