<s> secret deal : did britain secretly disagree to giving the malvinas to argentina ? <eos>

<s> indeed as spain had backing down there were recriminations within england as to why more concessions had not been demanded . suggestions of any agreement is a fantasy . the 'satisfaction ' demands and granted was a return to the status quo . <eos>

@highlight

<s> there is no findings of any agreement to hand the island over to the spanish . <eos>
