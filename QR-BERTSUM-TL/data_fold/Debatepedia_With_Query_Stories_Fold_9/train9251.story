<s> health : is cannabis harmless enough to be considered a medicine ? <eos>

<s> marijuana use can alter one 's perception of reality or consciousness . the alteration need not be thought of as spiritual or religious to be respected for what it is ; a fresh look on a reality that we are programed as humans to perceive only in a particular manner . marijuana can help humans perceive that complex reality from simply a different perspective which can benefit our appreciation for that reality and our unique and limited perception of it . with this more intelligent approach to marijuana consume it is easy to argue that mental auditory and societal benefits exist . <eos>

@highlight

<s> cannabis can have a beneficial mind-altering effect if used right <eos>
