<s> uphold christianity : is creationism importance to christianity ? <eos>

<s> on this question the bible just is wrong and if you insist on holding a literalistic approach to scriptures then the implications you claim do surely follow . however there is no theological need to do this . the roman catholic and the anglican churches for example have accepted the truth of evolution and they still hold what is a recognisably and distinctively christian faith . if the authors of the bible meant their created stories to be taken literally then their claiming are open to scientific test . it is widely held that they wrote stories designed to account for the world as they knew it and by todays standards these could not be held up as scientific accounts . <eos>
