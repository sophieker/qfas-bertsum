<s> religious institutions : are religious institutions generally harmful ? <eos>

<s> just because you believe in a just god does n't mean you are automatically expected to be perfect . most humans are theistic and since all humans are sinners most sinners are theists also . but just because a religion 's followers are fallen does not mean that the religion itself is automatically disproven . <eos>

@highlight

<s> all humans are imperfect . <eos>
