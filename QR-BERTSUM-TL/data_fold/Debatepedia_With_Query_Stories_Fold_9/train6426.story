<s> is it justified to giving away the national sovereignty of the europe states ? <eos>

<s> at the time of globalization at the time when international relations are become more and more complicated the view of state sovereign - the supremacy of political powers a nation has over its own actions - is eroding as our elected leaders are giving away their nations ' sovereign by placing more and more authority in supranational organizations like the un which are not accountable to voters . new international actors have risen as a result of improved communications and transportation . multiple channels of communications which involve numerous transnational alliances are making the essential borders of sovereign obsolete . <eos>

@highlight

<s> regional sovereign is a relic . <eos>
