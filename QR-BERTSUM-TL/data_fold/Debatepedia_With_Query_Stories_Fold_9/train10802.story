<s> us president abraham lincoln in justifying efforts to maintain the union in the face of an imminent civil war said in # `` a house divided can not stand '' . solidarity was argued to be essential to the integrity and future of the union . china can putting forth the same rationale for forcing tibet to remains whole of china . if tibet were to achieving independence both china and tibet could be weaker with less geopolitical strength and with greater tensions and opportunities for conflict . <eos>

@highlight

<s> the chinese government has a right to protect the solidarity of chinese against tibetan separatism . <eos>
