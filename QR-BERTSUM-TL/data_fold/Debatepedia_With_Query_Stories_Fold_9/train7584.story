<s> land-use : does algae biofuel take up too much land ? <eos>

<s> `` algae : not only the best biofuel by far ... '' . ecoversity - `` for the algae-culture projects which use large growing ponds the potential biodiesel production per acre is # to # times greater than obtainable with corn soy and palm oil . however the most efficient systems called photo-bioreactors stack clear tubes of water with algae in the sun requiring very little acreage for significant production . this is the system we are demonstrating at ecoversity .
