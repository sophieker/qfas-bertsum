<s> vs. rockets : is a space elevator exceptional to classical rockets ? <eos>

<s> space elevator can be used more than once . once built space elevator could lift cargo for those years while classical rockets are one-use only . but the space shuttle is only partially reusable ( external tank is always lost during the launch ) and require major overhaul after each landing before it is ready for the next launch . <eos>
