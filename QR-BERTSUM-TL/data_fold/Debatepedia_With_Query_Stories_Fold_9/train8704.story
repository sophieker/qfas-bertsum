<s> opinion : where do opinions stand in afghanistan and the us ? <eos>

<s> peter navarro . `` orange grove : get out of afghanistan now . '' oc register . september 25 2009 : `` the saddest fact is that our new president has taken ownership of this war less for strategic and military purposes and more to show his backbone . as a strong and early opponent of the iraq war barack obama had to protect his dovish flanks during the 2008 campaign by talking tough on afghanistan . now as he gets deeper into the quagmire the supreme irony is that he does n't have the backbone to realize this is an unwinnable war without any compelling strategic rationale .
