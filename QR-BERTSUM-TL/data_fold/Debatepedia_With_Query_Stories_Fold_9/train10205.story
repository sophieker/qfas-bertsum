<s> error-rates : does wikipedia have a fairly low rate of error ? <eos>

<s> . among wikipedia 's nearly # million articles such examples are likely to exist just from the sizes of this number alone . on the other hand the few analyses studies which have been done so far have found the average factual accurate of wiki to be different or sometimes even higher than that of traditional encyclopedias . <eos>

@highlight

<s> criticism of the robustness of wikipedia tends to highlights isolated examples <eos>
