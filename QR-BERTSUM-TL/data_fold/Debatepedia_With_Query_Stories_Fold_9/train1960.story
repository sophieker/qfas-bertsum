<s> socialism : is progressives taxation compatible with capitalism ? <eos>

<s> `` immorality of progressive income tax '' . the frugal libertarian ( libertarian ) . # oct. # - `` i am certain that most people would agree that stealing would not be regarded a moral act even if what was stolen was given to someone who needed it more than its original owner . imagine someone walking into your house and taking $ # # off your table walking out the door and giving your $ # # to someone else . there are few who would stand for this but every year we allow the federal government to essentially do the same really with little more than a grumble on tax day . we would fight off a burglar in our house but do anything to fight off the government <eos>

@highlight

<s> progressive taxation is socialist wealth redistribution and state burglary <eos>
