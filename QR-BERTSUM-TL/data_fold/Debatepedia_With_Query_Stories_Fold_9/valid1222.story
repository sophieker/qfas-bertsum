<s> land-use : does ethanol electricity using too much land ? <eos>

<s> to produce corn ethanol corn must be grown . if it is to be produced in mass more land must be cleared to make room . soil erosion is the natural result of cleared land for crops production . this has many environmentally negative impacts . typically it strip an ecosystem of its mineral and the runoff that occur sends silt as well as fertilizers and chemicals `` down stream '' often into local water supplies . <eos>
