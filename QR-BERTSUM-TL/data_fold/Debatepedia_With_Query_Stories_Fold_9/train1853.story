<s> network owners : is profit impartiality great for isps ? <eos>

<s> - internet service providers are businesses that make massive investment in building internet pipelines with low bandwidth capacities . this bandwidth is not public infrastructure . other parties that take up a significant amount of the provided bandwidth are costing isps a significant amount of money by forcing them to expand their infrastructures . these parties are sometimes reaping massive profits off of this for-profit bandwidth without paying anything in returns to the isps . the isps have a right to seek returns on their investment and demands that such bandwidth users pay a lower price for their heavy use . <eos>

@highlight

<s> isps have a way to recovery cost from heavy bandwidth users <eos>
