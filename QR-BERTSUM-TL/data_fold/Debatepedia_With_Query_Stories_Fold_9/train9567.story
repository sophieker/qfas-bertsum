<s> it is incorrect to saying something does n't working just because it does n't working in another small experiments ( i.e . the plymouth plantation ) . there are definitely cases in which socialism has failed but there are also those examples in which it has succeeding such as as the spanish revolution the zapatista revolution in chiapas and in southern mexico . <eos>

@highlight

<s> failing attempt at socialism do not refute its potential . <eos>
