<s> russia : will russia tolerating further expansion ? does this matter ? <eos>

<s> the realisation of this policy shall only serve to manufacture the expansionist demon that nato fears . the election of the ultranationalist duma in # the choice of the hardliner yvegeny primakov as overseas minister and the failure of the reformist parties russia s choice under yegor gaidar even to clear the # % hurdle for duma membership can be ascribed in whole or in part to the russian sense of isolation from western europe . this sense is dramatically emboldened by such provocative actions as threatening to station nato troops on its borders . the russian people are unlikely to consider that the forward deployments is not directed against them but instead is only design to maintain internal stability in the neighbouring republics . <eos>
