<s> obesity crisis : do calories count rightly responding to obesity crises ? <eos>

<s> while it is true that calorie counting alone is not sufficient for a healthy diet - as one would simply eat two burgers a day and meet their calorie requirements - it is true that it is a crucial component of a healthy diet . it would be said to be the most important one factor for all diets particularly when the focus is losing weight . that calorie counts are not the entire stories should not be used against them . they are just the most important factor in reducing the obesity epidemic making it crucial for restaurants to list calories on menus . <eos>

<s> calories counting is a critical component of a healthy diet . <eos>
