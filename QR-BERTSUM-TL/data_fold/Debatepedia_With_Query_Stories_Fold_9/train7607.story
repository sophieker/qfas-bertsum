<s> governance : does divide government offer good governance ? <eos>

<s> michael kinsley . `` mccain 's last mistake . undivided government wo n't be as bad as he warned it would be . '' slate . # nov. # - `` if you really long for change divided government is the last thing you should want . in a parliamentary system like the one in britain divided government is impossible . you vote for the party not the person . whichever party wins the most seats or can cobble together a majority through alliances with other party gets to form a government and choose a prime minister . the winning party is generally able to enact its agenda . more important that party can be held accountable if it does not enact its agendas or if it does and the policies fail .
