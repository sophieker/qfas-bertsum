<s> size : is the size of the stimulus package appropriate ? <eos>

<s> eliot spitzer . `` robots not roads '' . slate . jan. 5 2009 : `` the capacity of even the u.s. government to affect the overall global economy is limited . suppose the package is $ 800 billion over two years : $ 400 billion is less than 1 percent of the global economy and a mere 3 percent of the u.s. economy . in relative terms $ 400 billion is n't all that much more than the $ 152 billion spent on the 2008 stimulus which had nary an impact on the economy . '' <eos>
