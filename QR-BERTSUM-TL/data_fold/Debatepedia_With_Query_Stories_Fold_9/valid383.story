<s> is muons catalytic fusion a viable option ? <eos>

<s> - pions due to their higher mass than electrons binds the deuterium and tritium nucleus too tighter than electrons considerably increasing the probability of the fusion process enable the fusion to occur at near-room temperatures . <eos>

@highlight

<s> muon catalyzation would bring the temperature at which jazz can occur down <eos>
