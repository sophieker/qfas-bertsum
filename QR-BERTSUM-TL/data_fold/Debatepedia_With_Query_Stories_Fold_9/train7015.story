<s> learning : does it lead to improved learning in its broadest sense ? <eos>

<s> nclb creates a perverse incentive for schools to encouraging under-performing students to dropout and leave ( because it may be necessary for a school to avoid being labelled `` failing '' ) . it also creates an environments in which some students may become discouraged by their continually poor performance on tests and in which `` teaching to the test '' provides too little stimulation to other important interests that a student may have such as music . <eos>

@highlight

<s> no child left behind increases dropouts option . <eos>
