<s> david leonardt . `` more than one way to take over a bank '' . new york times . february # # - `` the federal government would declare a bank insolvent wipe out its existing shareholders fire its top executives and inject enough money to keep it functioning . the government could then siphon off the worst assets into a so-called bad bank pooling them with toxic assets from other nationalized banks and resell the bank s healthy parts to private investors . once the crisis lifts some of the toxic assets may even have value . '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> govt can temporarily nationalize banks reboot and resell <eos>
