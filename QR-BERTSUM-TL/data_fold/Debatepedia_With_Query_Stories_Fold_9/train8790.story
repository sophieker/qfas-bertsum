<s> crime : does abortion help reducing crime ? <eos>

<s> this argument is based on the premise that poverty and conditions conducive to crime often correlate to those that seeking abortions . stephen nicholson of freakonomics makes this argument . he contends that the # roe . supra wade legalization of abortions led to the fall in crime rate in the # s and # s across the united states . the period of declining crime he says correlated to the period when those that were aborted might have otherwise become criminals in society as a resulting of their circumstances . <eos>

@highlight

<s> abortion is more likely to wipe out the bad than the good . <eos>
