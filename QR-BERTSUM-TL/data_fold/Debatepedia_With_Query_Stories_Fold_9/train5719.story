<s> abuse : can the humanitarian intervention avoid being abused ? <eos>

<s> for example japan 's attack on manchuria mussolini 's invasion of ethiopia and hitler 's occupation of parts of czechoslovakia were all proclaimed to be humanitarian intervention and were accompanied by high-minded rhetoric . there are plenty more examples but these are the most telling . <eos>

@highlight

<s> rhetoric of humanitarian intervention has been abused historically . <eos>
