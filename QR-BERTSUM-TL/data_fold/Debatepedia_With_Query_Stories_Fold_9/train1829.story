<s> integration or discrimination : does unofficial english advance the longtime or later ? <eos>

<s> there are over three fifty languages spoken in the america states . and there are roughly # million american citizens ( about # % of the total population of # million ) who do not speak english . giving all of those persons in all of those different languages the right to demand government services in their own language is preposterous . if we give spanish speaking people this right we would naturally have to extend the right to all the other # some-odd languages and those that speak them . this would unreasonably burden government services adding a massive layer of bureaucracy and costs . even then inevitably somebody with some obscure language will find that their `` right '' to have services provide to them in their own <eos>

@highlight

<s> too those languages for right to govt service in own language . <eos>
