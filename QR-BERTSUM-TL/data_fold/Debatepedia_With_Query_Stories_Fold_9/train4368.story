<s> state authority ? does the state have the authority to limit the liberties of citizens ? <eos>

<s> for example through speed limits rules against drink driving etc . dangerous driving meets the classic liberal test by endangering not just the individual but others including drivers passengers and pedestrians and so society has a right to intervene to protect the innocent . a new law signals social unacceptability and will send a message to drivers ; the new york ban has already been highly effective . <eos>

@highlight

<s> state has authority to regulate actions of drivers ( by cell phone ban ) . <eos>
