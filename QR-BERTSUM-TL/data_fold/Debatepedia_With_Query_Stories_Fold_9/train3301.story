<s> environment : is offshore drilling consistent with environmental preservation ? <eos>

<s> suzanne sitherwood . `` let coastal states drill offshore if they want to '' . journal-constitution . # july # : `` while some argue that we do n't want to see exploration in these pristine areas the fact is that with today 's technology we can sensitively explore through directional drilling about # # acres of surface lands with a single well . is n't that a bargain when you calculate the cost to americans to continue to rely on energy overseas especially the volatile mideast ? '' <eos>

@highlight

<s> directional drilling allows a single well to tap massive reservoirs <eos>
