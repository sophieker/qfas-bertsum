<s> is it necessary to charges fat passengers extra when flying ? <eos>

<s> there is a standard weight airlines expecting people to be and that 's what they base their price on . most of the when people are under this weight and therefore pay extra for the more weight they could have had but do n't . if most of the flight is under the standard weight they would have pay a little bit too much . instead of the airline making even more profit the extra payment could be passed onto the fat passenger ( s ) and that would cover the cost . there is no need to make these people pay extra . <eos>

<s> most people weighing under the standard weight and their payment for a larger expected weight would covers the cost for <eos>
