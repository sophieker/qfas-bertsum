<s> spending vs. tax cuts : which provides a better economic stimulus ? <eos>

<s> `` filling the hole '' . economist . dec # th # - `` tax rebates or tax cuts will get more money into consumers hands quickly but in today s environment much of that boost will simply be saved as people plug the holes in their finances left by the collapsing values of their houses and retirement portfolios or just pay off debts . if consumers are unwilling to spend the best way for a government to boost demand is to spend more itself . one approach is to send large dollops of federal cash directly to america s struggling states '' <eos>
