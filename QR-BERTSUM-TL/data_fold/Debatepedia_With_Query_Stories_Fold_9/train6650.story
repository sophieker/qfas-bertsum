'' guardian : `` will being a nobel peace prize winner limit his range of options as america 's commander-in-chief in any way ? can a peace prize winner really then go forward and put 20 000 more us soldiers in afghanistan ? did those sneaky scandinavian pacifists have this thought up their scandinavian sleeves ? '' <eos>
