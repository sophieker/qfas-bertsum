<s> inspiration : would a missions to the lunar be more inspiring ? <eos>

<s> there is no fact beings have to pick between going to the lunar and going to mars ? it is not a one-or-the-other question . we can going both back to the lunar and on to mars . this is the general proposal putting forward by john w. bush and president obama calling for a return to the lunar around # and pushing on to mars in the late # s. so as much as the debate is splitting hairs about one `` or '' the other this is a false dichotomy . beings can going both to the lunar and on to mars . <eos>

@highlight

<s> beings can go again to the moon and on to mars . <eos>
