<s> feasibility : is full denuclearization feasible ? <eos>

<s> nuclear technology exists and there is no way to un-invent it . much as the ideal of global disarmament is fine the reality is that it is impossible : it takes only one rogue state to maintain a secret nuclear capability to make the abolition of the major powers ' deterrents unworkable . without the threat of a retaliatory strike this state could attack others at will . <eos>

@highlight

<s> nuclear weapons can not just be simply destroyed or dismantled <eos>
