<s> quality : does free universal health care provide superior care ? <eos>

<s> most of what determines length and quality of life ( excluding human issues such as traffic accidents homicides ... ) is genetics and life style choices ( eating/exercise ) . early detection will certainly weigh heavily on life expectancy for certain diseases but no amount of `` prevention '' will stop cancer if you genes are highly susceptible . as most people know most doctor 's visits end with `` take this and call me if it does n't get better '' which should hardly be seen as `` preventative '' of anything . <eos>

@highlight

<s> lack of preventative care does not significantly contribute to life expectancy or quality of life . <eos>
