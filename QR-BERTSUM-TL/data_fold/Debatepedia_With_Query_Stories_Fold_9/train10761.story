<s> political liberalization and the increased representation of opposition party in taiwan 's legislature have opened public debate on the island 's future ; advocates of taiwanese independence opposes the ruling party 's traditional stand that the islands will eventually reunify with mainland china . part of the fact for president lee teng hui s elections in # was his view that china and taiwan should have a state to state relationship . even if we disregard polls as easily changing in principle this is also in taiwan s interest . <eos>

<s> autonomy is more politically possibility in modern taiwan : <eos>
