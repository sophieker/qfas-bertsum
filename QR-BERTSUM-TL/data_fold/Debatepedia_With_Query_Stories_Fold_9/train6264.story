<s> not torture ? is it mistake to calling waterboarding torture ? <eos>

<s> - in the united states for example waterboarding is performed on hundreds of we soldiers and spys in order to acclimatize them with the discomfort they may experience abroad under foreign custody and interrogation techniques . but obviously the we government would not `` torture '' its own soldiers . if waterboarding was legitimately a `` torture '' techniques it would be unimaginable that the we government would perform the techniques on its own soldiers and spys . this would violate all civilian codes and would causes massive public protest . but that the common practice of waterboarding we citizens by the we civilian does not result in such protest seems to indicate very clearly that wateboarding is not `` torture '' . it is merely a highly uncomfortable practice but <eos>

@highlight

<s> waterboarding is not torture ; nations train own soldiers with it <eos>
